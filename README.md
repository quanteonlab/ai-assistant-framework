# [Project Name]  

**Your personal self-development assistant** ‚Äî a compact, interactive device that greets you when you arrive home and engages you in coding interviews, language-learning chats, or tech discussions, powered by open-source GPT models (gpt-oss) in a hybrid format ‚Äî either through the API or locally over LAN.

## ‚ú® Features  

- **Light-Triggered Wake-Up:** When you enter a room and turn on the light, the device ‚Äúwakes up‚Äù and greets you.  
- **Holographic Character Display:** Instead of a standard display, it features a small animal avatar (inspired by Rabbit R1) projected through a holographic-style prism screen for a unique, futuristic look.  
- **Web Dashboard:** Connect it to your laptop and access the built-in web interface to view live code, configure settings, and update functionality.  
- **Hybrid AI Engine:** Powered by gpt-oss, with support for both cloud API access and offline LAN-based operation.  
- **Interactive Skill Building:** The assistant can improve your communication skills by starting spontaneous conversations ‚Äî from the latest tech news to deep-dive discussions ‚Äî leveraging the agentic capabilities of gpt-oss.

## üõ† Bill of Materials (BOM)  

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **1.3-inch TFT LCD (ST7789)** | 240√ó240 pixel display for holographic projection |
| **Optical Glass Cube (25.4 mm Beamsplitter Prism)** | Creates the holographic visual effect |
| **MAX98357 module + Speaker** | Includes MAX98357 module & speaker for clear sound output |
| **NP0556 Microphone** | Captures voice commands and conversations |
| **Raspberry Pi Pico W** | Core microcontroller with Wi-Fi connectivity |
| **Power Supply** | 5 V USB adapter & Micro-USB cable |
| **Photoresistor** | Detects light changes to trigger wake-up events |

## üöÄ How It Works  

1. **Detection** ‚Äì The photoresistor senses room light changes when you arrive.  
2. **Greeting** ‚Äì The assistant powers on, displaying the holographic animal avatar.  
3. **Interaction** ‚Äì AI engages you in a chat, coding interview, language lesson or enhancing conversation skills.
4. **Customization** ‚Äì Use the web dashboard to tweak settings, flash code, etc.
