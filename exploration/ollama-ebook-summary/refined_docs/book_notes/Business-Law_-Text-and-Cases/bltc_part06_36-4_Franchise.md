#### Pricing Arrangements

Background context: Franchisors may require franchisees to purchase specific supplies from them at set prices. However, they cannot dictate resale prices due to antitrust laws.

:p What is a limitation on pricing arrangements in franchise agreements?
??x
A franchisor cannot set the resale prices for goods by the franchisee because such actions can violate state or federal antitrust laws. While a franchisor can suggest retail prices, it cannot mandate them.

Example: Jaguar can set purchase prices but cannot dictate how much dealers should charge customers for their services.

#### Effects of S Election on Taxation
Background context: The passage explains how an S corporation is taxed differently than a regular corporation, passing corporate income through to shareholders and avoiding double taxation.

:p What are the key effects of an S election on corporate taxation?
??x
The key effect of an S election is that an S corporation avoids double taxation by having its corporate income pass through to the individual shareholders, who then pay personal income tax on it. This treatment enables the S corporation to avoid the imposition of income taxes at both the corporate and shareholder levels while retaining many of the advantages of a corporation.

Benefits include:
- Shareholders' tax brackets may be lower than the tax bracket that the corporation would have been in if the tax had been imposed at the corporate level.
- The resulting tax savings are particularly attractive when the corporation wants to accumulate earnings for future business purposes.
- If the corporation has losses, shareholders can use these losses to offset other income.

These benefits make S corporations an attractive option despite competition from newer limited liability business forms like LLCs and LPs.
??x
For example, if a shareholder's personal income tax rate is lower than the corporate income tax rate, passing through income can result in significant savings. Additionally, using accumulated losses to offset other income provides flexibility.

```java
// Example Code: S Corporation Tax Pass-Through
public class STaxation {
    private int corporationIncome;
    private int shareholderTaxBracket;

    public STaxation(int corporationIncome, int shareholderTaxBracket) {
        this.corporationIncome = corporationIncome;
        this.shareholderTaxBracket = shareholderTaxBracket;
    }

    // Method to calculate tax savings
    public int calculateTaxSavings() {
        return corporationIncome * (1 - shareholderTaxBracket / 100); // Simplified calculation for illustration
    }
}
```

#### When Appraisal Rights Apply
Background context: Appraisal rights typically apply to mergers, consolidations, share exchanges, and sales of substantially all corporate assets. These rights are especially important in short-form mergers where minority shareholders have no prior notice or say.
:p In which types of transactions do appraisal rights commonly apply?
??x
Appraisal rights commonly apply to mergers, consolidations, share exchanges, and the sale of substantially all corporate assets. They are particularly significant in short-form mergers, as these often occur without advance notice to minority shareholders who have no opportunity to vote on them.
