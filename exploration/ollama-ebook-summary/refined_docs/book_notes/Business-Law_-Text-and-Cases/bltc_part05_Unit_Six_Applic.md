#### Tina's Bankruptcy Petition
Tina has just graduated from college and is working as a salesperson. She decides to file for bankruptcy, listing her debts which include student loans, taxes accruing within the last year, and a claim against her based on misuse of customers' funds during her employment.
:p Are all these debts dischargeable in bankruptcy?
??x
In Chapter 7 bankruptcy, most unsecured debts such as credit card debt, medical bills, and personal loans are typically discharged. However, student loans, taxes, and debts related to misappropriation of funds (such as customer funds) are generally not dischargeable. Therefore:
- **Student Loans**: Generally not dischargeable unless there is a very specific circumstance like undue hardship.
- **Taxes Acing within the Last Year**: Usually not discharged if they have been assessed by the IRS or other taxing authority and are still collectible at the time of filing bankruptcy.
- **Claim Based on Misuse of Customers' Funds**: Likely not dischargeable as it involves a fraudulent act.

#### Third Party’s Reasonable Reliance
Background context: For the doctrine of agency by estoppel to apply, the third party must reasonably believe that an agency relationship exists. This belief needs to be based on facts and circumstances such that a prudent person would also conclude there was authority.
:p How does the court determine if a third party's reliance is reasonable in an agency by estoppel case?
??x
The court determines if a third party’s reliance is reasonable based on whether, given all the facts and circumstances, a reasonably prudent person familiar with business practices and customs would have concluded that the purported agent had authority.
Example: If a hospital patient believes a physician who frequently acts for the hospital has authority to prescribe medication due to consistent behavior by the hospital staff, this could be considered reasonable reliance if similar actions were common practice.
```java
// Pseudocode Example:
if (prudentPersonBelieves(Patient.relianceOnPhysician)) {
    // Reasonable reliance established
} else {
    // Insufficient evidence of reasonable belief
}
```

#### Acts or Declarations by the Principal
Background context: The doctrine of agency by estoppel is not created solely by the acts or declarations of a purported agent. Instead, it is based on the deeds or statements made by the principal that create an appearance of authority.
:p What creates an agency by estoppel according to this text?
??x
An agency by estoppel is created when the principal's actions or declarations induce a third party to believe there is an agency relationship, and the third party acts on this belief. The principal’s conduct must make it appear as though the other person had authority.
Example: If a CEO repeatedly approves invoices from an employee without proper authorization, this could lead to the doctrine of estoppel when the employee uses similar approval methods in dealings with suppliers.
```java
// Pseudocode Example:
if (principalConductAppearsToGiveAuthority) {
    // Creates agency by estoppel
} else {
    // No basis for estoppel due to lack of apparent authority
}
```

#### Express Authority
Express authority is when a principal directly gives permission to an agent to act on their behalf. This explicit grant of power means that both the principal and third parties are legally bound by any contract made within this scope.

:p What is express authority?
??x
Express authority refers to the clear and direct authorization given by a principal to an agent, indicating that the agent has the legal right to make binding agreements on behalf of the principal. If the agent acts within these boundaries, both parties are legally bound.
