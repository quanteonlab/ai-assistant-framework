#### Usage of Trade

Background context: The usage of trade refers to practices and methods of dealing that are regularly observed within a specific place, vocation, or trade. Parties expect these practices to be adhered to in their transactions. Such usages can influence the interpretation of contracts.

:p What is an example where a usage of trade affects the outcome of a contract?
??x
In Example 20.23, Phat Khat Loans, Inc., hires Fleet Title Review Company for conducting title searches. The industry practice includes limiting liability to the amount of the fee as stated in Fleet's invoice. When Main Street Autos defaults on the loan and another lender has priority due to a previous claim, Phat Khat sues Fleet for breach of contract. However, Fleet’s liability is limited according to the common usage of trade and the parties' course of dealing.

```java
// Pseudocode example
public class UsageOfTradeExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Company phatKhat = new Company("Phat Khat Loans");
        Company fleetTitleReview = new Company("Fleet Title Review");

        // Fleet's invoice states "Liability limited to amount of fee"
        String invoiceStatement = "Liability limited to amount of fee";
        
        // Fleet conducts a title search and reports no claims
        List<String> report = new ArrayList<>();
        report.add("No claims found for Main Street Autos");
        
        phatKhat.lendTo(MainStreetAutos, 100000, report);
    }
}
```
