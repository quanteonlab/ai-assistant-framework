**Starting Chapter:** 3-4 Making Ethical Business Decisions

#### Step 4: Review
After implementing the decision, it is essential to review its outcome. The purpose is to determine if the chosen action solved the ethical problem and if stakeholders are satisfied with the result. This evaluation helps in improving future decisions.
:p What is the final step in making an ethical decision?
??x
The final step involves reviewing the outcome of the implemented decision. Decision makers assess whether the solution effectively addressed the ethical issue and if stakeholders are content with the results. They use this evaluation to learn from their experiences, thereby enhancing future ethical decision-making processes.
```java
// Example pseudocode for reviewing the decision
public class ReviewOutcome {
    public void review() {
        // Evaluate effectiveness of the action
        boolean problemSolved = true;
        
        // Check stakeholder satisfaction
        boolean stakeholdersSatisfied = true;
        
        if (problemSolved && stakeholdersSatisfied) {
            System.out.println("Decision was effective.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Improvement needed in future decisions.");
        }
    }
}
```

#### Ethical Perspectives and Their Application
Background context explaining that ethical perspectives vary and can be more or less helpful depending on the situation. Discusses Heigl's rights to privacy and image control versus potential safety concerns in other scenarios.

:p How might an ethical perspective differ when considering Heigl’s rights compared to a scenario involving public safety?
??x
An ethical perspective can differ significantly based on the specific context. In Heigl's case, her rights to privacy and image control are paramount because it involves personal information and consent issues. However, in a scenario where someone's right to safety is at stake, these rights might be overridden by more pressing concerns.

For example:
- **Heigl’s Case**: Her right to privacy and control over her image must be respected.
- **Safety Scenario**: If a public figure's information was used to protect public safety (e.g., in an emergency), the need for immediate action might justify breaching personal privacy. 

This illustrates how different ethical perspectives can lead to varying conclusions based on the specific situation.

#### IDDR Approach for Decision-Making
Background context: The IDDR (Identify, Decide, Do, Review) approach is a structured method for decision-making that includes identifying issues, making decisions, implementing actions, and reviewing outcomes. It ensures systematic consideration of ethical implications.

:p Using the IDDR approach, discuss the decision process Stilton should use in deciding whether to disclose the risk of fraudulent policies to potential investors.
??x
Stilton should follow these steps:

1. **Identify**: Recognize that there is a risk associated with not disclosing fraudulent policies. This includes understanding potential legal and ethical issues.
2. **Decide**: Determine if disclosure would be in the best interest of all stakeholders, including investors, employees, and customers. Consider the long-term benefits versus short-term costs.
3. **Do**: Implement a plan to disclose the risk transparently, ensuring it does not cause undue panic or misinformation.
4. **Review**: Evaluate the outcomes of disclosing the risk and adjust future practices accordingly.

The decision process should prioritize transparency and honesty to maintain trust with investors and other stakeholders.

#### Trade Secrets and Brad’s Involvement
Background context: If Brad, who helped with the design but was involved in selling Hallowed to another company, takes the idea and sells it, this raises issues related to trade secrets. A trade secret protects confidential business information that provides a competitive edge, such as formulas, practices, or processes.

:p Which type of intellectual property issue does this raise?
??x
This situation raises an issue related to trade secrets. Brad potentially took confidential information about Hallowed and used it for personal gain by selling the idea to another company.

??x
The answer with detailed explanations.
Brad’s actions could be seen as a breach of confidentiality, which is a key aspect of trade secret protection. Trade secrets involve safeguarding valuable, confidential information that gives a business an advantage over competitors. If Brad shared or used T rent and Xavier's proprietary design ideas without their consent, this would violate the principles of trade secret law.

??x
The answer with detailed explanations.
Brad’s involvement in selling Hallowed to another company could be viewed as a breach of confidentiality if he was privy to confidential information about the game. Trade secrets laws protect against unauthorized disclosure or use of such sensitive business information, making this scenario a clear issue related to trade secrets.
