#### Inductive Proof for Natural Numbers Past a Point

Background context: This section explains how to prove statements using induction, but starting from a natural number greater than 1. The p-test example is provided to illustrate this concept.

:p What does it mean to start proving a statement with induction past the base case of \(n=1\)?

??x
Inductive proof for natural numbers past a point involves setting a different base case (e.g., \(n=2\)) and assuming that the result holds for all previous values up to some \(k\). This is useful when the property being proven does not hold or is trivial at \(n=1\).

Example: To prove that \(\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{i}\) diverges for \(n \geq 2\), you would start with the base case of \(n=2\) and assume the result holds up to some \(k \in [2, n-1]\).

```java
public class PTest {
    public static boolean diverges(int n) {
        if (n < 2) return false; // Base case: doesn't apply here.
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            // Check the sum of 1/i from 2 to n
            if (!diverges(i - 1)) continue;
            // Since it diverges, we don't need further checks
        }
        return true; // By induction, divergence is shown.
    }
}
```

#### Combinatorial Proof: Binomial Theorem

Background context: This section explains the combinatorial proof that \(\sum_{i=0}^n \binom{n}{i} = 2^n\). The base case starts at \(n=0\) and assumes it holds for all previous values up to some \(k\).

:p What is the base case in proving \(\sum_{i=0}^n \binom{n}{i} = 2^n\)?

??x
The base case for this proof is when \(n=0\). The binomial coefficient \(\binom{0}{0} = 1\) and since \(2^0 = 1\), the statement holds true at the base case.

```java
public class BinomialTheorem {
    public static boolean checkBaseCase(int n) {
        if (n == 0) return true; // Base case: sum of binomials is 1, which equals 2^0.
        return false;
    }
}
```

#### Strong Induction

Background context: This concept explains the idea behind strong induction. Unlike regular induction where you prove \(S_{k+1}\) assuming \(S_k\), with strong induction, you assume all previous statements up to \(S_k\) are true.

:p What is the principle of strong induction?

??x
The principle of strong induction states that for a sequence of mathematical statements \(S_1, S_2, S_3, \ldots\):

- \(S_1\) is true.
- For any \(k \in \mathbb{N}\), if all the previous statements \(S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_k\) are true, then \(S_{k+1}\) must be true.

By this principle, you can prove that every statement in the sequence is true by showing both the base case and the induction step using multiple prior statements.

```java
public class StrongInduction {
    public static void strongInduction(int n) {
        if (n == 1) System.out.println("Base Case: S_1 is true"); // Base case: proven separately.
        
        for (int k = 1; k < n; k++) {
            // Assume all previous statements are true
            if (k > 1 && strongInduction(k - 1)) { // Inductive hypothesis
                System.out.println("S_" + (k+1) + " is true");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic

Background context: This theorem states that every integer \(n \geq 2\) can be expressed as a product of primes. The proof uses strong induction with the base case being \(n=2\), and assuming the statement is true for all integers up to some \(k\).

:p How does one prove the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic using strong induction?

??x
To prove the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, we use strong induction:

- Base Case: For \(n = 2\), which is prime, it satisfies the theorem.
- Inductive Hypothesis: Assume that for all integers up to some \(k \geq 2\), each integer can be expressed as a product of primes.

To prove that \(k+1\) is also expressible as a product of primes:

1. If \(k+1\) is prime, it trivially satisfies the theorem.
2. Otherwise, let \(k+1 = st\) where \(s\) and \(t\) are integers such that \(1 < s, t < k+1\). By the inductive hypothesis, both \(s\) and \(t\) can be expressed as products of primes.

```java
public class FundamentalTheoremOfArithmetic {
    public static boolean primeFactorization(int n) {
        if (n == 2) return true; // Base case: 2 is prime.
        
        for (int k = 2; k < n; k++) {
            // Assume all previous numbers are primes or products of primes
            if (!primeFactorization(k)) continue;
            
            int s = n / k, t = k;
            if (s * t == n && isPrime(s) && isPrime(t)) return true;
        }
        
        return false; // Inductive step: all numbers up to n-1 are primes or products of primes.
    }

    private static boolean isPrime(int num) {
        for (int i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(num); i++) if (num % i == 0) return false;
        return true;
    }
}
```

#### Strong Induction Explanation
Background context: The provided text discusses strong induction, a method of mathematical proof that is used when the statement to be proved depends on more than just the immediate previous case. It involves proving that if all smaller cases are true, then the current case must also be true.

The objective here is to understand how strong induction can handle cases where the next step relies on multiple preceding steps rather than just the immediately previous one.
:p What does the text suggest about the limitations of regular induction when dealing with \( k+1 \)?
??x
Regular induction often falters because it only considers the immediate previous case, which might not be sufficient to cover all scenarios for \( k+1 \). Strong induction, on the other hand, allows us to assume that all cases up to and including \( k \) are true, providing a more robust basis for proving statements about \( k+1 \).
x??

---

#### Prime or Composite Consideration
Background context: The text explains how we can use strong induction by considering whether \( k+1 \) is prime or composite. If it's composite, then we know it has factors \( s \) and \( t \), both of which must be less than \( k+1 \). By the inductive hypothesis, these factors are either primes or products of primes.

The objective here is to understand how to handle composite numbers within strong induction.
:p If \( k+1 \) is composite, what does the text suggest about its factors?
??x
If \( k+1 \) is composite, it can be expressed as a product of two smaller integers \( s \) and \( t \). By the inductive hypothesis, both \( s \) and \( t \) must satisfy the theorem since they are less than \( k+1 \), meaning they are either primes or products of primes. Therefore, their product \( st = k+1 \) will also be a product of primes.
x??

---

#### Base Case
Background context: The base case for strong induction is often straightforward and involves checking the smallest value (in this example, 2). Here, it's noted that since 2 is prime, the statement holds true for \( n=2 \).

The objective here is to understand how to establish a simple but crucial starting point in an induction proof.
:p What is the base case of the proof provided?
??x
The base case is when \( n = 2 \). Since 2 is a prime number, it satisfies the statement that every positive integer greater than 2 can be written as a product of primes.
x??

---

#### Inductive Step for Composite Numbers
Background context: In the inductive step, if \( k+1 \) is composite, we use strong induction by expressing \( k+1 \) as a product of two integers \( s \) and \( t \). The text explains that since these factors are smaller than \( k+1 \), they must also be either primes or products of primes.

The objective here is to understand the detailed process for handling composite numbers in strong induction.
:p How does the proof handle the case where \( k+1 \) is composite?
??x
If \( k+1 \) is composite, it can be written as \( s \times t \), where both \( s \) and \( t \) are smaller than \( k+1 \). By the inductive hypothesis, both \( s \) and \( t \) must be either primes or products of primes. Therefore, their product \( st = k+1 \) will also be a product of primes.
x??

#### Chocolate Bar Example
Background context: The text transitions to an example involving breaking a chocolate bar into smaller pieces, which is used to illustrate the concept of strong induction in a practical scenario.

The objective here is to understand how real-world problems can be modeled and solved using mathematical proof techniques like induction.
:p What question does the text use to transition to the example?
??x
The text uses the question: "Suppose you had a chocolate bar and you wanted to break it up completely, so that each piece is only one square of chocolate. How many breaks will be required to break it all up?" This question sets up a practical scenario where strong induction can be applied.

**Rating: 8/10**

#### Strong Induction Explanation
Background context: The provided text discusses a problem related to breaking up a chocolate bar into individual squares. It emphasizes the necessity of using strong induction for this proof, as regular induction would not suffice due to the nature of how breaks are made.

:p What is the key difference between regular and strong induction in the context of this problem?
??x
In this context, the key difference lies in the ability to use multiple previous cases in strong induction, which allows us to consider the breaks that result in more than one bar at a time. Regular induction only permits using the immediately preceding case (kth case for proving the (k+1)st case), making it unsuitable when each break can produce more than two smaller bars.
x??

---
#### Base Case of Induction
Background context: The base case establishes the simplest scenario, which is a 1×1 chocolate bar that requires zero breaks since it's already an individual square. This satisfies the result as required.

:p What does the base case prove in this induction proof?
??x
The base case proves that for a 1×1 chocolate bar, no breaks are needed because it's already in its simplest form (an individual square). Mathematically, this is shown by \(0 = 1^1 - 1\), which correctly reflects one less than the number of squares (1) in the base case.
x??

---
#### Inductive Hypothesis
Background context: The inductive hypothesis assumes that for all bars with at most k squares, the required number of breaks is k-1. This assumption helps build upon smaller cases to prove larger ones.

:p What does the inductive hypothesis state?
??x
The inductive hypothesis states that if a chocolate bar with \(k\) or fewer squares requires \(k - 1\) breaks, then any bar with more than \(k\) squares will require one less break than its number of squares. Formally, for all bars with up to \(k\) squares, the required number of breaks is \(k - 1\).
x??

---
#### Induction Step
Background context: The induction step involves proving that if a bar with \((k + 1)\) squares requires one less break than its number of squares (i.e., \(k\)), then any bar larger than this can be broken down according to the same rule.

:p What does the induction step show in relation to breaking chocolate bars?
??x
The induction step shows that if a chocolate bar with \((k + 1)\) squares requires \(k\) breaks, then for any bar with more than \(k + 1\) squares (specifically an \(m \times n\) bar), the number of breaks required is one less than the number of squares. This is proven by considering the first break which divides the bar into two smaller bars, and applying the inductive hypothesis to each.
x??

---
#### General Conclusion
Background context: The conclusion uses strong induction to prove that any chocolate bar requires one less break than its number of squares.

:p What does the overall proof demonstrate?
??x
The overall proof demonstrates that for any size of a chocolate bar (whether it's an \(m \times n\) grid, a triangle shape, or even with missing pieces), the number of breaks required to break it into individual squares is always one less than the number of squares. This is achieved through strong induction, where each step relies on multiple previous cases.
x??

---
#### Shape Independence
Background context: The proof extends beyond just rectangular bars and shows that the result holds for any shape as long as each break divides a single chunk into two.

:p Does the conclusion about the number of breaks depend on the shape of the chocolate bar?
??x
No, the conclusion does not depend on the shape of the chocolate bar. As long as the bar is divided such that each "break" splits one piece into two, the result remains that the number of breaks required is always one less than the number of squares (or pieces). This holds true for any shape and even if some pieces are missing.

#### Number of Breaks to Create Tchunks
Background context: This concept explains how many breaks are required to increase the number of chunks from 1 to T. Each break increases the chunk count by 1, so T-1 breaks are needed to reach T chunks.

:p How many breaks are needed to move from 1 chunk to T chunks?
??x
The answer is \(T - 1\) breaks are needed because each break increases the number of chunks by 1. For example, with 2 breaks, you go from 1 chunk to 3 chunks (1 + 2 = 3).

```java
// Pseudocode for calculating the number of breaks
public int calculateBreaks(int T) {
    return T - 1;
}
```
x??

---

#### Base Cases in Strong Induction
Background context: In strong induction, you can rely on multiple previous cases to prove a statement. Unlike regular induction where only the immediate preceding case is used, strong induction allows using any number of earlier cases.

:p How does strong induction differ from regular induction regarding base cases?
??x
In strong induction, at least two or more base cases are often necessary because each step can rely on multiple previous steps to prove a statement. For example, in the given proposition, the first and second base cases (n = 11 and n = 12) are used to prove subsequent cases.

```java
// Example pseudocode for strong induction with two base cases
public void strongInductionExample() {
    // Base case 1: n = 11
    if (n == 11) {
        a = 3;
        b = 1;
    } else if (n == 12) {
        a = 1;
        b = 2;
    }
    
    // Inductive step for k >= 12
    for (int i = 13; i <= n; i++) {
        int previousA, previousB;
        if (i - 1 == 11) {
            previousA = 3;
            previousB = 1;
        } else if (i - 1 == 12) {
            previousA = 1;
            previousB = 2;
        }
        
        a = previousA + 1; // Using the inductive hypothesis
        b = previousB;
    }
}
```

#### Writing Numbers as 2a + 5b
Background context: The proposition states that every natural number \(n \geq 11\) can be written as \(2a + 5b\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are non-negative integers. This is an application of strong induction, showing how to write numbers in a specific form.

:p Can you explain the process for writing numbers greater than or equal to 11 as \(2a + 5b\) using strong induction?
??x
The process involves proving two base cases (n = 11 and n = 12) and then showing that if it works for all previous values up to k, it will work for k+1. For example:
- Base case 1: \(11 = 2 \cdot 3 + 5 \cdot 1\)
- Base case 2: \(12 = 2 \cdot 1 + 5 \cdot 2\)

For any \(k \geq 12\), if \(k - 1\) can be written as \(2a + 5b\), then \(k\) can be written as:
\[ k = 2(a+1) + 5b \]

```java
// Pseudocode for writing numbers using strong induction
public boolean canWriteAsSum(int n) {
    if (n == 11) return true; // Base case 1
    else if (n == 12) return true; // Base case 2
    
    int previousA, previousB;
    if (n - 1 == 11) {
        previousA = 3;
        previousB = 1;
    } else if (n - 1 == 12) {
        previousA = 1;
        previousB = 2;
    }
    
    int a = previousA + 1; // Using the inductive hypothesis
    int b = previousB;
    return true; // n can be written as 2a + 5b
}
```

#### Strong Induction with Two Base Cases
Background context: The given example demonstrates strong induction where two base cases are used to prove a proposition for all \(n \geq 11\). This method is necessary when each step relies on the previous few steps, not just one.

:p How does this example use strong induction with two base cases?
??x
This example uses strong induction by proving that if it holds for all numbers from 11 to k, then it must hold for \(k+1\). Two base cases (n = 11 and n = 12) are proven first. Then, the inductive step assumes it is true for some \(k \geq 12\) and proves it for \(k+1\).

```java
// Example pseudocode for strong induction with two base cases
public boolean canWriteAsSum(int n) {
    if (n < 11) return false; // Base case not covered
    
    // Base cases
    if (n == 11) return true;
    else if (n == 12) return true;
    
    // Inductive step for k >= 12
    int previousA, previousB;
    if (n - 1 == 11) {
        previousA = 3;
        previousB = 1;
    } else if (n - 1 == 12) {
        previousA = 1;
        previousB = 2;
    }
    
    int a = previousA + 1; // Using the inductive hypothesis
    int b = previousB;
    return true; // n can be written as 2a + 5b
}
```

#### Difference Between Regular and Strong Induction
Background context: The text explains that regular induction relies only on the immediate preceding case, while strong induction allows using any number of earlier cases. This is demonstrated through examples where proving a statement for \(k+1\) requires more than just one previous step.

:p What is the key difference between regular induction and strong induction?
??x
Regular induction proves each case based solely on the immediately preceding case. In contrast, strong induction can use any number of earlier cases to prove a statement for the next case. For example, in the given proposition, proving \(n = k+1\) relies not just on the assumption that \(k-1\) works but also on knowing how \(k\) and possibly other previous values work.

```java
// Pseudocode comparison between regular and strong induction
public boolean canWriteAsSumRegular(int n) {
    if (n < 10) return false; // Base case not covered
    
    int a, b;
    if (n == 11) {
        a = 3;
        b = 1;
    } else if (n == 12) {
        a = 1;
        b = 2;
    }
    
    return true; // Based on previous case
}

public boolean canWriteAsSumStrong(int n) {
    if (n < 11) return false; // Base case not covered
    
    // Base cases
    if (n == 11) return true;
    else if (n == 12) return true;
    
    int previousA, previousB;
    if (n - 1 == 11) {
        previousA = 3;
        previousB = 1;
    } else if (n - 1 == 12) {
        previousA = 1;
        previousB = 2;
    }
    
    int a = previousA + 1; // Using the inductive hypothesis
    int b = previousB;
    return true; // Based on multiple base cases
}
```

#### Fake Proposition 4.11: Everyone on Earth has the same name
Background context explaining the concept of a flawed induction proof. The base case and inductive hypothesis are correct, but the inductive step contains a subtle logical flaw.

:p How does the inductive step fail to prove that everyone has the same name?
??x
The inductive step fails because it assumes that splitting the group into two smaller groups with the same number of people (k) ensures that all k+1 people have the same name. However, this does not necessarily hold true for overlapping groups or when the groups are split differently.

For example, consider a group of 2 people: Alice and Bob. If you apply the inductive hypothesis to the first person and the second person separately, it doesn't guarantee that they will have the same name. The flaw lies in assuming that just because two smaller groups (k) have the same names, the larger combined group (k+1) must also have the same name.

Code examples are not relevant for this logical proof.
x??

---

#### Fake Proposition 4.12: Harmonic Series Convergence
Background context explaining the concept of a flawed proof regarding the convergence or divergence of the harmonic series. The base case and inductive hypothesis are correct, but the inductive step contains an error that leads to a false conclusion.

:p Why is the inductive step incorrect in this fake proof?
??x
The inductive step is incorrect because it assumes that adding the next term (1/(k+1)) to the finite number F does not change its value. However, since \(F\) is actually a divergent series when extended indefinitely, adding 1/(k+1) will always result in a sum greater than 1.

The flaw lies in treating the harmonic series as if it converges to some finite number \(F\). In reality, the harmonic series diverges, meaning that its sum grows without bound. Therefore, the induction step should show that the sum of the first k+1 terms is still less than 1, which contradicts the known fact about the harmonic series.

Code examples are not relevant for this logical proof.

#### Inductive Proof of a Finite Sum

Background context: The text presents an incorrect proof by induction, which claims that \(1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \cdots + \frac{1}{k+1} < 1\). The objective is to identify the flaw in this proof and understand why it does not hold.

:p Identify the error in the provided proof.
??x
The main issue with the given proof lies in its conclusion. The proof attempts to show that \(1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \cdots + \frac{1}{k+1} < 1\) by induction, but it fails because the inequality is incorrect for any finite sum of unit fractions. Specifically:

- For \( k = 1 \), \( 1 + \frac{1}{2} = 1.5 > 1 \).
- The proof incorrectly assumes that if a statement holds for some \(k\), it must hold for \(k+1\) without properly verifying the inequality.

Therefore, the base case and the inductive step do not correctly establish the desired result.

#### Geometric Series Formula

Background context: A lemma is stated regarding geometric series where each term doubles. The formula given is \(\sum_{i=0}^{n} 2^i = 2^{n+1}-1\). This is a classic example of an inductive proof.

:p What does the inductive hypothesis look like for this lemma?
??x
The inductive hypothesis can be stated as:
\[ 1 + 2 + 4 + \cdots + 2^k = 2^{k+1} - 1. \]
This assumption is made to prove the next term, i.e., \(1 + 2 + 4 + \cdots + 2^k + 2^{k+1}\).

To show that:
\[ 1 + 2 + 4 + \cdots + 2^k + 2^{k+1} = 2^{(k+1)+1} - 1. \]

#### Strong Induction for Binary Representation

Background context: The text uses strong induction to prove that every natural number \( n \) can be represented uniquely as a sum of distinct powers of 2, i.e., its binary representation.

:p How does the base case in the proof of unique binary representation work?
??x
The base case is when \( n = 1 \). The statement asserts that:
\[ 1 = 2^0. \]
This is true and shows that 1 can be uniquely represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2, which is just \(2^0\).

To verify this, we note that any other representation would include at least one power of 2 greater than 1, making the sum larger than 1. Hence, there is only one valid way to represent 1.
x??

---
#### Inductive Step for Binary Representation

Background context: The inductive step involves proving that if every number up to \( k \) can be represented uniquely as a sum of distinct powers of 2, then \( k+1 \) can also be represented uniquely.

:p What is the approach taken to prove the inductive step?
??x
The inductive step assumes that for all natural numbers \( m \leq k \), they can be expressed uniquely as sums of distinct powers of 2. We need to show that \( k+1 \) can also be represented uniquely.

Consider the binary representation of \( k \):
\[ k = a_0 + a_1 \cdot 2^1 + a_2 \cdot 2^2 + \cdots + a_k \cdot 2^k, \]
where each \( a_i \) is either 0 or 1.

To represent \( k+1 \):
- If the last bit of \( k \) (i.e., \( a_0 \)) is 0, then set it to 1 and all higher bits remain unchanged.
- Otherwise, the last bit is 1. We need to adjust the previous bits according to the carry-over rules in binary addition.

This adjustment ensures that \( k+1 \) can be represented uniquely by modifying only one or a few bits of its binary representation from \( k \).

The inductive step thus confirms that every number has a unique binary representation.
