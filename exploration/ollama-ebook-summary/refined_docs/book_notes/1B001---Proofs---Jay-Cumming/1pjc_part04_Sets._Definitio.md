**Starting Chapter:** Sets. Definitions

---


#### Definition of a Set
Background context: A set is an unordered collection of distinct objects, called elements. Sets are fundamental to mathematics and can contain any type of object.

:p What is the definition of a set?
??x
A set is an unordered collection of distinct objects, known as elements. This means that the order of elements in a set does not matter, and each element must be unique.
x??

---
#### Notation for Sets
Background context: Sets are often denoted using curly braces { }, where the elements inside are listed. If no elements are present, it is called the empty set.

:p How do you denote an empty set?
??x
The empty set is denoted by ; or {}. This represents a set with no elements.
x??

---
#### Types of Sets: Natural and Integers
Background context: The natural numbers (N) consist of positive integers starting from 1. The integers (Z) include all whole numbers, both positive and negative, including zero.

:p What is the notation for natural numbers?
??x
The set of natural numbers is denoted by N = {1, 2, 3, ...}.
x??

---
#### Examples of Sets Containing Non-Numbers
Background context: Elements in a set do not have to be numbers; they can be any type of object.

:p Can you provide an example of a set containing non-numerical elements?
??x
Yes, the set {apple, Joe, } contains non-numerical elements such as "apple," "Joe," and a smiley face.
x??

---
#### The Empty Set vs. A Set Containing the Empty Set
Background context: The empty set is denoted ; or {}. It is different from the set containing the empty set {;}, which has one element, the empty set.

:p What is the difference between ; and {;}?
??x
The symbol ; represents an actual empty set with no elements. On the other hand, {;} denotes a set that contains one element, which is the empty set.
x??

---
#### Set Builder Notation
Background context: Set builder notation provides a way to define sets by specifying rules for generating their elements.

:p What is set-builder notation?
??x
Set-builder notation defines a set using the form {elements : conditions}, where "elements" are the objects that belong in the set, and "conditions" describe how these elements are generated.
x??

---
#### Examples of Set Builder Notation
Background context: Set builder notation can be used to define sets with specific conditions. For example, all squares of natural numbers or integers.

:p Provide an example of a set defined using set-builder notation.
??x
For example, the set of perfect squares from natural numbers is {n^2 : n ∈ N} = {1, 4, 9, 16, ...}.
x??

---
#### The Set of Rational Numbers
Background context: The set of rational numbers (Q) includes all numbers that can be expressed as a fraction a/b where both a and b are integers and b ≠ 0.

:p What is the definition of the set of rational numbers?
??x
The set of rational numbers Q = {a/b : a, b ∈ Z and b ≠ 0} consists of all fractions formed by integers a and b, with b not equal to zero.
x??

---
#### Real Numbers and Set Notation
Background context: The real numbers (R) include all numbers that can be represented on the number line. They are often defined informally as decimal numbers.

:p How is the set of real numbers denoted?
??x
The set of real numbers is denoted by R.
x??

#### Examples Using Set Notation and Real Numbers
Background context: Set notation can be used to define various sets, such as 2×2 matrices or intervals in the real number system.

:p How would you write the set of all 2×2 real matrices using set-builder notation?
??x
The set of all 2×2 real matrices can be written as { [a b; c d] : a, b, c, d ∈ R }.
x??

---
#### The Unit Circle in Set Notation
Background context: In mathematics, the unit circle is defined as the set of points (x, y) that satisfy x^2 + y^2 = 1.

:p How would you define the unit circle using set notation?
??x
The unit circle can be defined as S₁ = { (x, y) ∈ R² : x² + y² = 1 }.
x??

---
#### Open and Closed Intervals Using Set Notation
Background context: Intervals are subsets of the real numbers that include all points between two endpoints. They can be open, closed, or half-open.

:p How would you define an open interval (a, b) using set notation?
??x
An open interval (a, b) can be defined as { x ∈ R : a < x < b }.
x??

---


#### Proving \(A = B\)
Background context: To prove that two sets \(A\) and \(B\) are equal, we need to show that every element of \(A\) is also an element of \(B\) (i.e., \(A \subseteq B\)), and every element of \(B\) is also an element of \(A\) (i.e., \(B \subseteq A\)). This means proving both inclusions.

:p What does it mean to prove that two sets \(A\) and \(B\) are equal?
??x
To prove that two sets \(A\) and \(B\) are equal, we must show that every element of \(A\) is also an element of \(B\), and every element of \(B\) is also an element of \(A\). This can be achieved by proving both \(A \subseteq B\) and \(B \subseteq A\).
x??

---

#### Set Union and Intersection
Background context: The union of two sets \(A\) and \(B\) (denoted as \(A \cup B\)) is the set containing all elements that are in \(A\), or in \(B\), or in both. Similarly, the intersection of two sets \(A\) and \(B\) (denoted as \(A \cap B\)) contains all elements that are in both sets.

:p Define the union and intersection of two sets.
??x
The union of two sets \(A\) and \(B\) is defined as:
\[ A \cup B = \{ x : x \in A \text{ or } x \in B \} \]

The intersection of two sets \(A\) and \(B\) is defined as:
\[ A \cap B = \{ x : x \in A \text{ and } x \in B \} \]
x??

#### Venn Diagrams
Background context: Venn diagrams are a visual way to represent the relationships between different sets. They use overlapping circles to illustrate how sets interact with each other.

:p What is a Venn diagram used for in set theory?
??x
A Venn diagram is used to visually represent and understand the relationships between different sets, such as unions, intersections, and complements.
x??

---

#### Set Operations on Multiple Sets
Background context: Union and intersection can be extended to multiple sets. For \(n\) sets \(A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n\), the union of all these sets is denoted by:
\[ \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} A_i = A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \cdots \cup A_n \]
Similarly, the intersection of all these sets is denoted by:
\[ \bigcap_{i=1}^{n} A_i = A_1 \cap A_2 \cap \cdots \cap A_n \]

:p What are the notations for union and intersection over multiple sets?
??x
The union of \(n\) sets \(A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n\) is denoted as:
\[ \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} A_i = A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \cdots \cup A_n \]

The intersection of these sets is denoted as:
\[ \bigcap_{i=1}^{n} A_i = A_1 \cap A_2 \cap \cdots \cap A_n \]
x??

---

#### Example with Venn Diagrams
Background context: Venn diagrams can be used to represent the union and intersection of multiple sets. For example, \(A \cup B \cup C\) represents all elements in at least one of the three sets, while \(A \cap B \cap C\) represents only those elements common to all three sets.

:p How would you represent the union and intersection of three sets using Venn diagrams?
??x
To represent the union of three sets \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) in a Venn diagram, you shade the regions that are part of any of the three sets. This includes all parts of each circle and their overlaps.

For the intersection of these sets \(A \cap B \cap C\), you would shade only the region where all three circles overlap.
x??

---

#### Cartesian Product
Background context: The Cartesian product of two sets \(A\) and \(B\) (denoted as \(A \times B\)) is a set of all possible ordered pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a \in A\) and \(b \in B\).

:p What is the Cartesian product of two sets?
??x
The Cartesian product of two sets \(A\) and \(B\) (denoted as \(A \times B\)) is a set containing all possible ordered pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a \in A\) and \(b \in B\).

\[ A \times B = \{ (a, b) : a \in A \text{ and } b \in B \} \]
x??

---

#### Cardinality of Sets
Background context: The cardinality of a set is the number of elements in that set. For finite sets, this can be found by simply counting the elements.

:p What does the cardinality of a set represent?
??x
The cardinality of a set represents the number of distinct elements it contains.

#### Proposition 3.15 - Alternative Proof Using Subsets and Power Sets
Background context: This proof is an alternative way to demonstrate that if \(P(A) \subseteq P(B)\), then \(A \subseteq B\). The original proof used a direct approach, but this one relies on the properties of sets and their power sets.

:p How does the proof show that \(A \subseteq B\) using the fact that \(P(A) \subseteq P(B)\)?
??x
The proof begins by acknowledging that \(A \subseteq A\), which is true because every set is a subset of itself. Given this, since \(A \in P(A)\), and we know \(P(A) \subseteq P(B)\), it follows that \(A \in P(B)\). This means \(A\) must be a subset of \(B\) by the definition of the power set.

```plaintext
Proof:
1. By definition, \(A \subseteq A\).
2. Since \(A \in P(A)\) and \(P(A) \subseteq P(B)\), it follows that \(A \in P(B)\).
3. By the definition of a power set, if \(A \in P(B)\), then \(A \subseteq B\).

#### De Morgan’s Law - Venn Diagram Intuition
Background context: This section introduces De Morgan's Law through visual intuition using Venn diagrams to help understand the logical equivalence.

:p How can you use a Venn diagram to intuitively verify part of De Morgan's Law?
??x
By drawing a Venn diagram for \(A \cup B\), its complement is everything outside this union. This corresponds to the area within the universal set U but not inside A or B, which aligns with \(A^c \cap B^c\). Similarly, the Venn diagram for \(A \cap B\) and its complement will show that the shaded regions match those of \(A^c \cup B^c\).

```plaintext
Venn Diagram Visualization:
1. Draw U with sets A and B.
2. \( (A \cup B)^c \) is everything outside A or B.
3. \( A^c \cap B^c \) is the intersection of areas outside A and B, matching step 2.
4. Both diagrams should look identical for De Morgan's Law to hold.
```
x??

---

#### Proof of \( (A \cup B)^c = A^c \cap B^c \)
Background context: This proof demonstrates the first part of De Morgan’s Law by showing that the complement of a union is equal to the intersection of complements.

:p How do you prove the first identity of De Morgan's Law, i.e., \( (A \cup B)^c = A^c \cap B^c \)?
??x
The proof involves two steps: proving both inclusions separately. First, show that if an element is in \( (A \cup B)^c \), it must also be in \( A^c \cap B^c \), and vice versa.

```plaintext
Proof:
1. Prove \( (A \cup B)^c \subseteq A^c \cap B^c \):
   - Assume \( x \in (A \cup B)^c \). By definition, this means \( x \notin A \cup B \).
   - Thus, \( x \notin A \) and \( x \notin B \), which implies \( x \in A^c \) and \( x \in B^c \).
   - Therefore, \( x \in A^c \cap B^c \).

2. Prove \( A^c \cap B^c \subseteq (A \cup B)^c \):
   - Assume \( x \in A^c \cap B^c \). By definition, this means \( x \in A^c \) and \( x \in B^c \).
   - Thus, \( x \notin A \) and \( x \notin B \), so \( x \notin A \cup B \).
   - Therefore, \( x \in (A \cup B)^c \).

Combining these two inclusions proves the equality.
```
x??

---

#### Proof of \( (A \cap B)^c = A^c \cup B^c \)
Background context: This proof is left as an exercise for the reader but follows a similar approach to the first part.

:p How would you prove the second identity of De Morgan's Law, i.e., \( (A \cap B)^c = A^c \cup B^c \)?
??x
The proof involves showing both inclusions: if an element is in \( (A \cap B)^c \), it must also be in \( A^c \cup B^c \), and vice versa.

```plaintext
Proof:
1. Prove \( (A \cap B)^c \subseteq A^c \cup B^c \):
   - Assume \( x \in (A \cap B)^c \). By definition, this means \( x \notin A \cap B \).
   - Thus, \( x \notin A \) or \( x \notin B \), which implies \( x \in A^c \) or \( x \in B^c \).
   - Therefore, \( x \in A^c \cup B^c \).

2. Prove \( A^c \cup B^c \subseteq (A \cap B)^c \):
   - Assume \( x \in A^c \cup B^c \). By definition, this means \( x \in A^c \) or \( x \in B^c \).
   - Thus, \( x \notin A \) or \( x \notin B \), so \( x \notin A \cap B \).
   - Therefore, \( x \in (A \cap B)^c \).

Combining these inclusions proves the equality.

#### Set Equality Proof: (A ∪ B)ᶜ = Aᶜ ∩ Bᶜ
Background context explaining the concept of set equality and operations. The proof involves understanding how complements, unions, and intersections interact with each other.

:p Prove that \((A \cup B)^c = A^c \cap B^c\) using a direct proof.
??x
To prove this, we need to show that if an element \( x \) belongs to the complement of \( (A \cup B) \), then it must also belong to the intersection of the complements of \( A \) and \( B \). Conversely, if an element \( x \) belongs to the intersection of the complements of \( A \) and \( B \), then it must belong to the complement of \( (A \cup B) \).

1. **Step 1:** Assume \( x \in (A \cup B)^c \). By definition, this means that \( x \notin A \cup B \).
    - Since \( x \notin A \cup B \), it must be true that \( x \notin A \) and \( x \notin B \).
    - This implies \( x \in A^c \) and \( x \in B^c \).
    - Therefore, \( x \in A^c \cap B^c \).

2. **Step 2:** Assume \( x \in A^c \cap B^c \). By definition, this means that \( x \in A^c \) and \( x \in B^c \).
    - Since \( x \in A^c \), it implies \( x \notin A \).
    - Similarly, since \( x \in B^c \), it implies \( x \notin B \).
    - Therefore, \( x \notin A \cup B \).
    - This implies \( x \in (A \cup B)^c \).

Combining these steps shows that both directions of the inclusion hold true:
\[
(A \cup B)^c = A^c \cap B^c
\]

#### Set Intersection and Complement Notation Simplification

Background context explaining how to manipulate set notation using definitions.

:p Simplify \( A^c \cap B^c \) using set-builder notation.
??x
Using the definition of complement, intersection, and union:
1. Start with the definition of the intersection: \( A^c \cap B^c = \{ x \in \mathbb{R} : x \in A^c \text{ and } x \in B^c \} \).
2. By the definition of complement, this translates to: 
   \[
   A^c \cap B^c = \{ x \in \mathbb{R} : x \notin A \text{ and } x \notin B \}
   \]
3. Using the definition of union, we can rewrite the condition as:
   \[
   \{ x \in \mathbb{R} : x \notin (A \cup B) \}
   \]
4. Finally, by the definition of complement, this is equivalent to:
   \[
   (A \cup B)^c
   \]

Thus,
\[
A^c \cap B^c = (A \cup B)^c
\]

#### Proving an Element Belongs to a Set

Background context explaining how to prove that an element belongs to a set, especially when the set is defined in set-builder notation.

:p How do you prove \( 22 \in \mathbb{Q} \)?
??x
To prove that \( 22 \in \mathbb{Q} \), we use the definition of the rational numbers. The set of rational numbers \( \mathbb{Q} \) is defined as:
\[
\mathbb{Q} = \left\{ x \in \mathbb{R} : x = \frac{p}{q}, p, q \in \mathbb{Z}, q \neq 0 \right\}
\]
1. **Step 1:** Identify that \( 22 \) is in the form of a fraction.
   - Notice that \( 22 = \frac{22}{1} \).
2. **Step 2:** Check if both numerator and denominator are integers, with the denominator non-zero.
   - Here, \( p = 22 \in \mathbb{Z} \) and \( q = 1 \in \mathbb{Z} \), and \( q \neq 0 \).

Since all conditions for being a rational number are satisfied, we conclude:
\[
22 \in \mathbb{Q}
\]

#### Indexed Families of Sets

Background context explaining indexed families of sets and their notation.

:p What is an indexed family of sets?
??x
An indexed family of sets is a collection of sets where each set in the collection can be uniquely identified by an index from some indexing set \( I \). It is often written as:
\[
\{A_i\}_{i \in I}
\]
For example, if we have a family of sets where each set corresponds to integers, we might write:
\[
F = \{ A_i \mid i \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \}
\]
where \( A_i \) is some set for each positive integer \( i \).

This notation helps in discussing collections of sets in a structured manner. For instance, if every element in the family \( F \) is itself a set, then \( F \) is called an indexed family of sets.

Example:
\[
F = \{ f_1; 2; 3 \}; N; \{ 7; \pi; -22 \} \]
Here, each element in \( F \) is another set.
