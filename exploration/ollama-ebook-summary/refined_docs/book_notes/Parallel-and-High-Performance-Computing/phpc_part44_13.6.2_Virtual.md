#### Docker Containers Overview
Docker containers provide a lightweight and portable way to package software. They are particularly useful for developers who need an isolated environment for their applications without having to manage the underlying infrastructure fully.

:p What is the primary advantage of using Docker containers mentioned?
??x
The primary advantage of using Docker containers is that they offer a lightweight and portable environment, making it easier to develop, test, and deploy applications consistently across different environments. This isolation ensures that dependencies are encapsulated within the container, which can significantly reduce setup time and improve consistency.

Docker containers also allow for rapid deployment and scaling since they abstract away much of the underlying infrastructure management.

#### Cloud Computing Overview
Cloud computing refers to servers provided by large data centers, which can be accessed via various cloud providers. These services are useful when specific hardware resources like GPUs are limited or unavailable on local machines. Some cloud providers cater specifically towards High Performance Computing (HPC) needs.

:p What is the primary purpose of using cloud computing in the context of this chapter?
??x
The primary purpose of using cloud computing is to access hardware resources, such as GPUs, that may not be available locally, allowing for exploration and experimentation with parallel computing applications.

#### Docker Containers for Development
Background context: Using pre-built Docker containers can be easier than manually configuring and installing software on individual systems, especially given the complexity of setting up development environments for GPU computing.

:p How can developers simplify the setup process using Docker?
??x
Developers can use pre-built Docker containers to simplify the setup process. These containers encapsulate all necessary dependencies and configurations, making it easy to replicate a consistent development environment without manually installing software.
