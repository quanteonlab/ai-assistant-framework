#### Data Transfer Cost Analysis
An example is provided showing how data transfer costs are measured and compared between two versions of the same code.

:p What does the OpenACC Details window illustrate?
??x
The OpenACC Details window illustrates the cost of each operation, including data transfers, for different versions of a code. It allows developers to compare performance optimizations by visualizing the cost of operations in both the original and optimized versions.

#### Code Example for Workgroup Size Adjustment
Consider the following pseudocode where you adjust the workgroup size based on occupancy metrics.

:p How would you implement a logic to adjust workgroup size in CUDA using a simple approach?
??x
You can implement a logic to adjust the workgroup size in CUDA by monitoring the occupancy and dynamically changing the workgroup size when it falls below a certain threshold. Here is an example pseudocode:

```cpp
// Pseudocode for adjusting workgroup size based on occupancy
int originalWorkGroupSize = 256; // Initial work group size

// Monitor occupancy and make adjustments if necessary
while (occupancy < targetOccupancyThreshold) {
    originalWorkGroupSize /= 2; // Halve the work group size to increase occupancy
    // Launch kernel with updated workgroup size
    launchKernel(kernelFunction, gridDim, dim3(originalWorkGroupSize), blockSize);
}
```
This pseudocode illustrates how you can reduce the workgroup size when occupancy is low, ensuring that each compute unit (CU) has enough work to avoid stalling.

#### Stalls and Their Causes
Provide a list of reasons for kernel stalls, including memory dependency, execution dependency, synchronization, memory throttle, constant miss, texture busy, and pipeline busy.

:p List the main causes of kernel stalls?
??x
The main causes of kernel stalls are:
- Memory dependency: Waiting on a memory load or store.
- Execution dependency: Waiting on a previous instruction to complete.
- Synchronization: Blocked warp due to synchronization calls.
- Memory throttle: Large number of outstanding memory operations.
- Constant miss: Miss in the constants cache.
- Texture busy: Fully utilized texture hardware.
- Pipeline busy: Compute resources not available.

#### Achieved Bandwidth and Its Importance
Explain the importance of bandwidth as a metric, especially for understanding application performance. Mention that comparing achieved bandwidth to theoretical and measured values can provide insights into efficiency.

:p Why is achieving high bandwidth important?
??x
Achieving high bandwidth is crucial because most applications are bandwidth limited. By comparing your achieved bandwidth measurements to the theoretical and measured bandwidth performance of your architecture (from sections 9.3.1 through 9.3.3), you can determine how well your application is utilizing memory resources. This comparison helps in identifying whether optimizations like coalescing memory loads, storing values in local memory, or restructuring code are necessary.

#### Docker Containers as a Workaround
Describe the use of Docker containers for running software that doesn't work on the native operating system. Mention the process to build and run a Docker container.

:p How can Docker containers be used?
??x
Docker containers can be used to run software that only runs on specific OSes, such as Linux on Mac or Windows laptops. The process involves building a basic OS with necessary software using a Dockerfile, then running it in a Docker container. This is useful for testing and developing GPU code when the latest software release doesn't work on your company-issued laptop.
