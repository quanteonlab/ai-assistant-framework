#### Massive Parallelism on GPUs
Background context explaining the concept. The GPU's massive parallelism stems from the need to process large volumes of data, such as pixels, triangles, and polygons for high frame rates and quality graphics. This is achieved by applying a single instruction across multiple data items.

:p What is massive parallelism in the context of GPUs?
??x
Massive parallelism on GPUs refers to the ability to execute many operations simultaneously. For example, when rendering graphics, each pixel can be processed independently using the same set of instructions, allowing for high performance and efficiency.

#### Shared Memory Usage
Shared memory within a work group allows for efficient communication and coordination among neighboring threads.

:p How is shared memory utilized in GPU programming?
??x
Shared memory within a work group enables threads to communicate and coordinate effectively. It provides a way for threads to share data without relying on the global memory, which can be slower due to contention. This improves performance by reducing memory latency.

#### Data Decomposition into NDRange or Grid
Data decomposition is fundamental to achieving high performance on GPUs. The technique involves breaking down a large computational domain into smaller, manageable blocks of data that can be processed independently and concurrently.

Background context: 
In OpenCL, this decomposition process is referred to as an `NDRange`, which stands for N-dimensional range. For CUDA users, the term used is simply `grid`.

:p How does data decomposition work in GPU programming?
??x
Data decomposition works by breaking down a large computational domain (such as a 2D or 3D grid) into smaller tiles or blocks that can be processed independently and concurrently. This allows for efficient use of parallel processing resources.

For example, if you have a 1024x1024 2D computational domain, you might want to decompose it into 8x8 tiles to process each tile in parallel. The decomposition process involves specifying the global size (the size of the entire domain) and the tile size (the size of each block or tile).

```java
// Example code for data decomposition in OpenCL

int globalSize = 1024; // Global size of the computational domain
int tileSize = 8;      // Size of each tile
int NTx = globalSize / tileSize;
int NTy = globalSize / tileSize;

// The total number of work groups (tiles) is calculated as:
int NT = NTx * NTy;
```

#### Work Group Synchronization and Context Switching
Work group synchronization involves coordinating the execution of multiple subgroups or work groups to ensure that they complete their operations in a coordinated manner. Context switching refers to switching between different subgroups or work groups.

Background context: 
Context switching is necessary for efficient use of processing elements, especially when some subgroups are waiting on memory reads or other stalls.

:p What is the purpose of context switching in GPU programming?
??x
The purpose of context switching in GPU programming is to hide latency by switching between different subgroups or work groups. When a subgroup hits a stall (e.g., due to a memory read), the scheduler switches to another subgroup that is ready to compute, ensuring efficient use of processing elements.

```java
// Pseudocode showing context switching

for (int i = 0; i < numSubgroups; i++) {
    if (subgroup[i].isStalled()) {
        // Switch to another subgroup that is ready to compute
        switchToSubgroup(subgroup[i+1]);
    }
}
```
