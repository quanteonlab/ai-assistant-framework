#### Time-Reversibility for CTMCs
Background context: In this section, we revisit the concept of time-reversibility but extend it to Continuous-Time Markov Chains (CTMCs). We discuss rates of transitions between states and how they can be used to determine limiting probabilities. The key terms are \(q_{ij}\), \(\pi_i q_{ij}\), \(\nu_i\), and \(\nu_i P_{ij}\).

:p What is the rate of transitions from state \(i\) to state \(j\) in a CTMC?
??x
The rate of transitions from state \(i\) to state \(j\) is denoted by \(q_{ij}\). This represents the instantaneous transition rate from one state to another.

#### Definition of Time-Reversibility for CTMCs
Background context: A CTMC is considered time-reversible if, for all states \(i\) and \(j\), the rate of transitions from state \(i\) to state \(j\) equals the rate of transitions from state \(j\) to state \(i\).

:p What defines a CTMC as being time-reversible?
??x
A CTMC is time-reversible if, for all states \(i\) and \(j\), the rate of transitions from state \(i\) to state \(j\) equals the rate of transitions from state \(j\) to state \(i\). Mathematically, this can be expressed as \(\pi_i q_{ij} = \pi_j q_{ji}\) where \(\pi_i\) is the limiting probability that the CTMC is in state \(i\).

#### Proof of Lemma 14.2
Background context: The proof involves showing that if certain conditions hold, then the values \(x_i\) can be identified as the limiting probabilities and the system is time-reversible.

:p How does the proof show that \(x_i\) are the limiting probabilities?
??x
The proof shows that if we have \(x_i q_{ij} = x_j q_{ji}\) for all \(i\) and \(j\), then \(\sum_i x_i q_{ij} = x_j \sum_i q_{ji}\). Given that \(\nu_i = \sum_j q_{ij}\), this can be rewritten as:
\[ \sum_i x_i q_{ij} = x_j \nu_i. \]
Since \(\pi_i\) is the limiting probability, we know \(\pi_i \nu_i = 1\). Therefore,
\[ \pi_i \sum_j x_j q_{ji} = \pi_j \nu_j. \]
Given that \(\pi_i \nu_i = 1\), it follows that \(\pi_i\) must be proportional to \(x_i\). Since the sum of probabilities is 1, we conclude \(\pi_i = x_i\).

#### Differentiating M/M/k and M/M/k/k Systems
Background context: In this chapter, two types of server farm models are discussed. The M/M/k system allows for unbounded queuing, while the M/M/k/k system has a capacity constraint.

:p How do the M/M/k and M/M/k/k systems differ in their queue management?
??x
The M/M/k system uses an unbounded FCFS (First-Come-First-Served) queue. In contrast, the M/M/k/k system has a capacity constraint of \(k\) jobs; if all servers are busy when a new job arrives, the job is dropped.

#### Time-Reversibility in CTMCs
Background context: The concept of time-reversibility for Continuous-Time Markov Chains (CTMCs) is crucial for understanding the behavior and properties of these systems.

:p What does the rate \(\nu_i\) represent in a CTMC?
??x
The rate \(\nu_i\) represents the total rate of transitions leaving state \(i\), given that the system is in state \(i\). It can be calculated as \(\nu_i = \sum_j q_{ij}\).

#### Example Code for Time-Reversibility Check
Background context: To verify time-reversibility, one needs to check if certain conditions hold.

:p Write a pseudocode example to check the time-reversibility of a CTMC.
??x
```pseudocode
function isTimeReversible(transMatrix)
    n = size(transMatrix, 1)  // Get number of states
    for i from 0 to n-1
        totalOutRate_i = sum(transMatrix[i, :])  // Calculate νi
        for j from 0 to n-1
            if transMatrix[i][j] != transMatrix[j][i] * (totalOutRate_j / totalOutRate_i)
                return false
    return true
end function
```
This pseudocode checks the condition \(x_i q_{ij} = x_j q_{ji}\) for all states, where \(\nu_i\) is used to normalize the rates.

#### CTMC and Time-Reversibility

CTMC (Continuous-Time Markov Chain) is a stochastic process where the states change over time according to certain transition rates. A key property of some CTMCs is time-reversibility, meaning that the system behaves the same way when run forward or backward in time.

The balance equations for the CTMC are given by:

\[ \pi_i q_{ij} = \pi_j q_{ji}, \forall i, j \]

If this condition holds true, then the stationary distribution (π) can be used to solve the balance equations directly.

:p What is an example of a CTMC that is not time-reversible?
??x
An example of a CTMC that is not time-reversible would be a chain where there's an arc from state i to state j labeled with transition rate qij, but no arc from state j to state i. In this case, the rate of going from state i to state j is πiqij, while the rate of going from state j to state i is zero.

This implies that transitions are only in one direction, breaking the time-reversibility condition.

#### Birth-Death Processes

A birth-death process is a special type of CTMC where each state transition changes by exactly one unit. Specifically:

- From state \(i\) to \(i+1\): This is called a "birth."
- From state \(i+1\) to \(i\): This is called a "death."

The key characteristic of birth-death processes is that the balance equations are simpler due to this linear transition pattern.

:p Are all birth-death processes time-reversible?
??x
Yes, all birth-death processes are time-reversible. To prove this, observe that during any period of time \(t\), the number of transitions from state \(i\) to \(i+1\) is within 1 of the number of transitions from state \(i+1\) to state \(i\). This is because you cannot repeat a transition from \(i\) to \(i+1\) without first returning to state \(i\), and this return can only happen through a transition from \(i+1\) back to \(i\).

Thus, the long-run rate of transitions (number of transitions divided by time) from state \(i\) to state \(i+1\) is equal to the rate of transitions from \(i+1\) to state \(i\). This ensures that the time-reversibility condition holds.

:p Can you provide an example of a birth-death process?
??x
A classic example of a birth-death process is the M/M/1 queue, where jobs arrive according to a Poisson process with rate \(\lambda\), and service times are exponentially distributed with rate \(\mu\).

In this model:
- The state transitions from \(i\) to \(i+1\) represent an arrival (birth).
- The state transitions from \(i+1\) to \(i\) represent a departure (death).

The balance equations for such processes can be solved using the time-reversibility approach, leading to the steady-state probabilities.

:p How is time-reversibility useful in solving CTMCs?
??x
Time-reversibility simplifies the solution of CTMCs by providing a direct way to derive the limiting distribution. By setting up and solving the time-reversibility equations, one can often find the stationary distribution without having to solve the more complex balance equations directly.

For example, in an M/M/1 queue, we guess that \(\pi_i = \left(\frac{\lambda}{\mu}\right)^i \cdot \pi_0\). Substituting this into the time-reversibility equation confirms its correctness. Finally, by ensuring that the sum of all probabilities equals 1, we determine \(\pi_0\) and thus the full stationary distribution.

:p What are insensitivity results in queueing theory?
??x
Insensitivity results in queueing theory refer to situations where certain performance measures (like blocking probability) depend only on the mean of a parameter rather than its specific distribution. For example, in an M/M/k/k system, the blocking probability \(P_{\text{block}}\) depends solely on the ratio \(\frac{\lambda}{\mu}\), not on the actual service time or interarrival time distributions.

This is significant because it means that the key performance metrics are robust to variations in the underlying distribution, making these results highly valuable for practical applications where exact distributions might be hard to determine.

#### M/M/k/k Loss System

The M/M/k/k loss system models scenarios where a queue has \(k\) servers and only allows up to \(k\) jobs at any time. Arrivals follow a Poisson process with rate \(\lambda\), and service times are exponentially distributed with rate \(\mu\). If all servers are busy, an arrival is lost.

:p What should the state space be for this system?
??x
The state space for the M/M/k/k loss system represents the number of busy servers in the system. The states range from 0 to \(k\), where:
- State 0: No jobs are being served.
- State \(i\) (1 ≤ i < k): Exactly \(i\) jobs are being served.
- State \(k\): All \(k\) servers are occupied.

The CTMC for this system is shown in Figure 14.2, with transitions labeled by their respective rates \(\lambda\) and \(\mu\).

:p How do we determine the blocking probability?
??x
To determine the blocking probability \(P_{\text{block}}\), which is the fraction of jobs that are lost when all servers are busy, we model the M/M/k/k loss system as a CTMC. The key idea is to solve the time-reversibility equations for the steady-state probabilities.

By solving these equations and summing up the probabilities from state 0 to \(k\), we get:

\[ P_{\text{block}} = \frac{\left(\frac{\lambda}{\mu}\right)^k / k!}{1 + \sum_{i=1}^{k} \frac{\left(\frac{\lambda}{\mu}\right)^i}{i!}} \]

This is known as the Erlang-B formula. By using the Poisson distribution, we can remember this result more easily:

\[ P_{\text{block}} = e^{-\lambda/\mu} \cdot \left(\frac{\lambda/\mu}{k!}\sum_{i=0}^{k} \frac{(λ/μ)^i}{i!}\right) \]

:p What is the significance of insensitivity results in queueing theory?
??x
Insensitivity results are significant because they show that certain performance measures, such as blocking probability \(P_{\text{block}}\) in an M/M/k/k system, depend only on the mean service and arrival rates (\(\lambda\) and \(\mu\)), rather than their specific distributions. This means that even if the underlying distribution of service times or interarrival times is not known precisely, one can still accurately predict important queueing behavior.

For example, in an M/M/k/k system, \(P_{\text{block}} = e^{-λ/μ} \cdot \frac{(λ/μ)^k}{k!} / \sum_{i=0}^{k} (λ/μ)^i / i!\), which only depends on the ratio \(\lambda/\mu\).

This is particularly useful in practical applications where exact distributions are difficult to determine, as it allows for robust and reliable predictions.

#### System Utilization (ρ)
Background context: The system utilization, denoted by \(\rho\), is a measure of how busy the servers are. In an M/M/k system, it is defined as \(\rho = \frac{\lambda k}{\mu}\), where \(\lambda\) is the arrival rate and \(k\mu\) represents the total service capacity.

:p What is the definition of system utilization in an M/M/k queueing system?
??x
The system utilization \(\rho\) for an M/M/k system is given by \(\rho = \frac{\lambda k}{\mu}\). This measures the average load on the system, indicating how often servers are busy. It's derived from dividing the total arrival rate by the total service capacity.

#### Resource Requirement (R)
Background context: The resource requirement \(R\) is defined as the expected number of jobs in service and can also be interpreted as the minimum number of servers needed to maintain stability, given by \(R = \frac{\lambda}{\mu}\).

:p What does the variable R represent in an M/M/k system?
??x
In an M/M/k system, \(R\) represents the expected number of jobs in service and can also be viewed as the minimum number of servers required to keep the system stable. It is calculated as \(R = \frac{\lambda}{\mu}\), where \(\lambda\) is the arrival rate and \(\mu\) is the service rate per server.

#### Probability that an Arrival Has to Queue (PQ)
Background context: The probability that an arriving job has to queue, denoted by \(P_Q\), is the probability that all servers are busy when a new job arrives. This can be expressed as:
\[ P_Q = \sum_{i=k}^{\infty} \pi_i (i - k) \]
where \(\pi_i\) represents the stationary probabilities of having \(i\) jobs in the system.

:p What is the formula for calculating \(P_Q\), and what does it represent?
??x
The probability that an arriving job has to queue, \(P_Q\), can be calculated using:
\[ P_Q = \sum_{i=k}^{\infty} \pi_i (i - k) \]
This represents the probability that all servers are busy when a new job arrives and must join the queue.

#### Erlang-C Formula
Background context: The famous Erlang-C formula is used to find \(P_Q\), which is the blocking probability. It relates directly to the system utilization \(\rho\) as:
\[ P_Q = (1 - \rho) \frac{(\frac{k \rho}{1 - \rho})^k}{k!} \cdot \frac{\frac{k \rho}{(1 - \rho)^2}}{1 - \rho} \]

:p What is the Erlang-C formula and what does it calculate?
??x
The Erlang-C formula for calculating \(P_Q\), the probability that an arriving job has to queue, is given by:
\[ P_Q = (1 - \rho) \frac{\left(\frac{k \rho}{1 - \rho}\right)^k}{k!} \cdot \frac{\frac{k \rho}{(1 - \rho)^2}}{1 - \rho} \]
This formula helps in determining the blocking probability, i.e., the likelihood that an arriving job will have to wait because all servers are busy.

:p What is the formula for calculating \(E[TQ]\)?
??x
The expected time a job spends in the queue \(E[T_Q]\) can be calculated using:
\[ E[T_Q] = \frac{E[N_Q]}{\lambda} = \frac{P_Q \rho}{\lambda (1 - \rho)} \]

:p What is the formula for calculating \(E[T]\)?
??x
The expected total time a job spends in the system \(E[T]\) can be calculated using:
\[ E[T] = E[T_Q] + \frac{1}{\mu} = \frac{P_Q \rho}{\lambda (1 - \rho)} + \frac{1}{\mu} \]
This measures the average time a job spends from arrival to departure, including both queueing and service times.
