#### Transition to Continuous-Time Markov Chains (CTMC)
In practice, we do not always need to translate a CTMC into a discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) with δ-steps. We can directly derive balance equations for the CTMC and solve them for the limiting probabilities πi.

:p What is the primary advantage of working directly with continuous-time Markov chains?
??x
By working directly with CTMCs, we avoid the complexity and potential inaccuracies introduced by translating to a discrete-time framework, making it easier to derive and solve balance equations.

#### Balance Equations in CTMCs
The balance equations for a CTMC are derived from the principle that the rate at which jobs leave state j equals the rate at which they enter state j. The standard notation is:

\[
π_jν_j = \sum_{i} π_i q_{ij}
\]

where:
- \(π_j\) is the limiting probability of being in state j.
- \(ν_j\) is the transition rate out of state j.
- \(q_{ij}\) is the transition rate from state i to state j.

:p What do the balance equations represent in a CTMC?
??x
The balance equations represent the equality between the total rate at which jobs leave state j and the total rate at which jobs enter state j. This ensures that there is no net flow of probability into or out of state j in the long run.

#### Interpreting Balance Equations for CTMCs
The left-hand side (LHS) of the balance equation represents the product of the limiting probability \(π_j\) and the transition rate out of state j, νj. The right-hand side (RHS) is a sum over all states i, where each term represents the product of the limiting probability of being in state i and the transition rate from state i to state j.

:p What does the left-hand side of the balance equation represent?
??x
The left-hand side of the balance equation represents the total rate at which transitions leave state j. It is calculated as \(π_j \cdot ν_j\), where \(π_j\) is the limiting probability of being in state j, and \(ν_j\) is the transition rate out of state j.

#### Interpreting Balance Equations for CTMCs (continued)
The ith term on the RHS represents the product of the limiting probability \(π_i\) and the transition rate \(q_{ij}\), which is the rate at which transitions from state i to state j occur. The sum over all states i on the RHS gives the total rate at which transitions enter state j.

:p What does each term in the summand of the right-hand side (RHS) represent?
??x
Each term in the summand of the RHS represents the rate at which transitions leave state i to go to state j. It is calculated as \(π_i \cdot q_{ij}\), where \(π_i\) is the limiting probability of being in state i, and \(q_{ij}\) is the transition rate from state i to state j.

#### Summary Theorem for CTMCs
For an irreducible CTMC with πi’s that satisfy the balance equations:

\[
π_jν_j = \sum_{i} π_i q_{ij}
\]

and

\[
\sum_{i} π_i = 1
\]

the πi's are the limiting probabilities for the CTMC, and the CTMC is ergodic.

:p What does the Summary Theorem state about the limiting probabilities of an irreducible CTMC?
??x
The Summary Theorem states that if there exist πi’s such that they satisfy both the balance equations \(π_jν_j = \sum_{i} π_i q_{ij}\) and the normalization condition \(\sum_{i} π_i = 1\), then these πi's are the limiting probabilities for the CTMC, and the CTMC is ergodic.

#### Converting a CTMC to a DTMC
The provided figure (Figure 12.10) shows a simple CTMC with states 1, 2, and 3, and transition rates λ31, λ12, λ21, and λ32.

:p How can we model the given CTMC as a DTMC?
??x
To convert the CTMC to a DTMC, we introduce a small time step δ. The rate of transitions between states in the DTMC will be \( \frac{λ_{ij}}{\delta} \). For example, for state 1, the transition rates would be:

\[
p_{12} = \frac{λ_{12}}{\delta}, \quad p_{13} = \frac{λ_{13}}{\delta}
\]

Similarly, for other states. The balance equations in the DTMC can then be derived and taken to the limit as δ → 0 to obtain the balance equations for the original CTMC.

#### Potential Pitfall: Balance vs Stationary Equations
For a CTMC, the balance equations yield the limiting probabilities directly. However, stationary equations are meaningless unless they are first translated into a DTMC.

:p What is the difference between balance equations and stationary equations in the context of CTMCs?
??x
Balance equations for CTMCs give the limiting probabilities directly, while stationary equations for CTMCs do not have a meaningful interpretation until the CTMC is translated into a DTMC. The stationary equations for a CTMC are equivalent to the balance equations only after such a translation.

#### M/M/1 Queueing System Overview
Background context: The simplest queueing model consists of a single server with Exponentially distributed service times and Poisson-distributed interarrival times. This system is denoted as M/M/1, where "M" stands for memoryless (Exponential distribution) in both the arrival process and service times, and the first slot describes the number of servers (1 in this case).
:p What is an M/M/1 queueing system?
??x
An M/M/1 queueing system consists of a single server where customers arrive according to a Poisson process with rate λ and are served with Exponential service times having mean 1/μ. The term "M" indicates that both the arrival and service processes follow an exponential distribution, implying memoryless properties.

#### Birth-Death Process
Background context: In an M/M/1 system, the states of the queue form a birth-death process where state transitions only occur between consecutive states. The rate at which the system leaves state \( j \) is denoted as \( μ_j \), and the rate at which it enters state \( j+1 \) is denoted as \( λ_j \).
:p What does the term "birth" represent in a birth-death process?
??x
In a birth-death process, the term "birth" represents an increase in the number of customers in the system. In the context of M/M/1, this corresponds to new customer arrivals.

#### Balance Equations for State 1
Background context: To find the steady-state probabilities \( π_j \) for each state \( j \), balance equations are used. These equate the rate at which the system leaves a state with the rate at which it enters that state.
:p What is the balance equation for state 1?
??x
The balance equation for state 1 in an M/M/1 queueing system is given by:
\[ π_1(λ + μ) = π_0 λ + π_2 μ \]
This equation balances the rate at which customers leave state 1 (both to state 0 and to state 2) with the rate at which they enter state 1.

#### General Form of Steady-State Probabilities
Background context: The steady-state probabilities \( π_j \) for states in an M/M/1 queueing system are derived by assuming a general form and then solving balance equations. This involves finding expressions for \( π_j \) that satisfy the balance equations.
:p What is the assumed form of \( π_i \) for state i?
??x
The assumed form of \( π_i \) for state i in an M/M/1 queueing system is:
\[ π_i = \left(\frac{λ}{μ}\right)^i (1 - ρ) \]
where \( ρ = \frac{λ}{μ} \) is the server utilization.

#### Determining π₀
Background context: The value of \( π_0 \) must be determined so that the sum of all probabilities equals 1. This involves solving a geometric series.
:p How do you determine the value of \( π_0 \)?
??x
To determine \( π_0 \), we use the normalization condition:
\[ \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} π_i = 1 \]
Given that \( π_i = \left(\frac{λ}{μ}\right)^i (1 - ρ) \), we have:
\[ \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \left(\frac{λ}{μ}\right)^i (1 - ρ) = 1 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ (1 - ρ) \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \left(\frac{λ}{μ}\right)^i = 1 \]
The sum of the infinite geometric series is:
\[ \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \left(\frac{λ}{μ}\right)^i = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{λ}{μ}} = \frac{1}{1 - ρ} \]
Thus, we get:
\[ (1 - ρ) \cdot \frac{1}{1 - ρ} = 1 \]
Therefore,
\[ π_0 = \frac{1}{1 - ρ} \]

#### Mean Number of Customers in the System
Background context: The mean number of customers \( E[N] \) can be derived by conditioning on the state. This involves summing over all states, weighted by their probabilities.
:p How do you calculate the mean number of customers \( E[N] \)?
??x
The mean number of customers \( E[N] \) in an M/M/1 queueing system is calculated as:
\[ E[N] = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} i π_i \]
Substituting \( π_i = \left(\frac{λ}{μ}\right)^i (1 - ρ) \):
\[ E[N] = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} i \left(\frac{λ}{μ}\right)^i (1 - ρ) \]
This can be simplified using the formula for the sum of a geometric series:
\[ E[N] = \rho + 2ρ(1 - ρ)\left(\frac{\lambda}{\mu}\right) + 3ρ(1 - ρ)\left(\frac{\lambda}{\mu}\right)^2 + \ldots \]
Recognizing this as the derivative of a geometric series:
\[ E[N] = \rho \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} i \left(\frac{λ}{μ}\right)^i (1 - ρ) = \rho \cdot \frac{d}{dρ} \left( \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \left(\frac{λ}{μ}\right)^i (1 - ρ) \right) \]
\[ E[N] = \rho \cdot \frac{d}{dρ} \left( \frac{1 - ρ}{1 - \frac{λ}{μ}} \right) = \rho \cdot \frac{1}{\left(1 - \frac{λ}{μ}\right)^2} = \frac{ρ^2}{1 - ρ} \]

#### M/M/1 Queue Mean Number of Customers

Background context: The M/M/1 queue is a fundamental model for single-server queuing systems where arrivals follow a Poisson process and service times are exponentially distributed. The utilization factor \(\rho\) represents the ratio of arrival rate \(\lambda\) to service rate \(\mu\). A key property of this system is the expected number of customers in the system, which can be derived using the formula \(E[N] = \frac{\rho}{1 - \rho}\).

:p What does the equation for the mean number of customers in an M/M/1 queue represent?
??x
The equation \(E[N] = \frac{\rho}{1 - \rho}\) represents the expected number of customers in the system, including both those being served and waiting. This relationship highlights how increasing the utilization factor \(\rho\) can dramatically affect the mean number of customers.

#### Variance of Number of Customers

Background context: The variance of the number of customers in an M/M/1 queue is given by \(Var(N) = \frac{\rho}{(1 - \rho)^2}\). This measure provides insight into the variability or spread of the customer count around its mean.

:p What does the formula for the variance of the number of customers represent?
??x
The formula \(Var(N) = \frac{\rho}{(1 - \rho)^2}\) represents the variance in the number of customers present in the M/M/1 queue. It shows that as \(\rho\) increases, the variance grows more sharply than the mean, indicating a higher likelihood of having significantly more or fewer customers than the average.

#### Little’s Law and Mean Response Time

Background context: Little's Law is a fundamental principle stating that the mean number of items in a system \(E[N]\) equals the arrival rate \(\lambda\) multiplied by the mean time an item spends in the system \(E[T]\). For an M/M/1 queue, this can be expressed as:
\[ E[N] = \frac{\rho}{1 - \rho} \]
and
\[ E[T] = \frac{1}{\mu - \lambda} \]

:p How do we use Little's Law to find the mean time in system?
??x
Using Little's Law, we can find the mean time an item spends in the system by calculating \(E[T] = \frac{E[N]}{\lambda}\). Given that for an M/M/1 queue, \(E[N] = \frac{\rho}{1 - \rho}\), it follows that:
\[ E[T] = \frac{1}{\mu - \lambda} \]

This relationship shows how the mean time in the system is inversely related to the difference between the service rate and arrival rate.

#### Impact of Increasing Arrival and Service Rates

Background context: If both the arrival rate \(\lambda\) and service rate \(\mu\) are increased by a factor \(k\), the utilization \(\rho\) remains unchanged, but throughput is increased. The mean number of customers in the system also stays constant, while the mean response time decreases proportionally.

:p What happens to the throughput when both arrival and service rates are increased proportionally?
??x
When both arrival rate \(\lambda\) and service rate \(\mu\) are increased by a factor \(k\), the throughput is increased by the same factor \(k\). This is because:
\[ X_{new} = k \cdot X_{old} \]
where \(X\) represents the throughput.

This result explains why increasing both arrival and service rates can accommodate more traffic with less delay per packet.
