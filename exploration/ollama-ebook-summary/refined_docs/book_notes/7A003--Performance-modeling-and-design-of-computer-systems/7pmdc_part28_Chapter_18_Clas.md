#### Overview of Classed Network of Queues
Background context: This chapter generalizes Jackson's network to include classed networks, where routing probabilities and service rates can depend on job classes. Key properties like product form still apply but with additional considerations for job types.

:p What is a key difference between standard Jackson networks and classed networks?
??x
In classed networks, the routing probabilities and service rates may depend on the job class (type). This allows more complex scenarios to be modeled accurately.

#### Motivation for Classed Networks: CPU-Bound and I/O-Bound Jobs
Background context: Discusses a computer system with different workloads where the behavior of jobs (I/O-bound vs. CPU-bound) affects their processing.

:p What additional considerations are needed in this scenario compared to a standard Jackson network?
??x
We need routing probabilities that differ based on job type/class (e.g., I/O-bound and CPU-bound). Standard Jackson networks do not distinguish between such types, making them unsuitable for modeling these behaviors.

#### Motivation for Classed Networks: Service Facility with Repair Center
Background context: Describes a service scenario where jobs may need to visit a repair center after some visits. The job's history affects its routing and future behavior.

:p Why is the ability to change job types important in this network?
??x
It allows distinguishing between "good" (never visited repair center) and "bad" (visited repair center) jobs, affecting their routing probabilities. Standard Jackson networks do not allow such dynamic changes.

#### Concept of Job Class Dependent Arrival Rates
Background context: Discusses the need for arrival rates to depend on job classes in classed networks.

:p What does ri(c) represent in a classed network?
??x
ri(c) represents the outside arrival rate at server i, which depends on the job class c. This allows modeling scenarios where different types of jobs arrive at servers with varying probabilities.

#### Concept of Class Dependent Routing Probabilities
Background context: Explains that routing probabilities should be allowed to depend on the job class in classed networks.

:p How do class-dependent routing probabilities differ from standard Jackson network behavior?
??x
In a classed network, Pij (probability of moving from server i to j) can depend on the job type/class c. In contrast, Jackson networks assume fixed and identical routing probabilities across all jobs.

#### Notation and Modeling for Classed Jackson Networks
Background context: The provided text introduces notation and modeling for a classed Jackson network, which is an extension of the basic Jackson network with additional features. It defines various quantities such as arrival rates (both total and per-class), service rates, utilization, and routing probabilities.

:p What are the definitions of \( r_i \) and \( \lambda_i \)?
??x
\( r_i \) is the arrival rate to server \( i \) from outside the network. On the other hand, \( \lambda_i \) represents the total arrival rate to server \( i \), which includes both inside and outside arrivals.

For per-class rates:
- \( r_i(c) \) denotes the arrival rate of class \( c \) jobs to server \( i \) from outside the network.
- \( \lambda_i(c) \) is the total arrival rate of class \( c \) jobs to server \( i \).

The relationships between these quantities are given by:
\[ r_i = \sum_{c=1}^l r_i(c) \]
\[ \lambda_i = \sum_{c=1}^l \lambda_i(c) \]

This notation is crucial for understanding the flow of different classes of packets through the network.

#### Deriving Total Arrival Rates
Background context: The text discusses how to derive total arrival rates \( \lambda_j \) into server \( j \). However, it notes that we cannot directly solve for \( \lambda_j \), but can compute per-class arrival rates \( \lambda_j(c) \).

:p How do you compute the total arrival rate \( \lambda_j \)?
??x
To compute the total arrival rate \( \lambda_j \), which is the sum of all per-class arrival rates into server \( j \):

\[ \lambda_j = \sum_{c=1}^l \lambda_j(c) \]

Where:
- \( \lambda_j(c) \) is the arrival rate of class \( c \) jobs into server \( j \), which can be determined by solving a system of simultaneous equations.
The equation for \( \lambda_j(c) \) is given by:

\[ \lambda_j(c) = r_j(c) + \sum_{i=1}^k \sum_{c'=1}^l \lambda_i(c') P(c')(c)_ij \]

Here, \( P(c')(c)_ij \) represents the probability that a job at server \( i \) of class \( c' \) next moves to server \( j \) and becomes a class \( c \) job.

#### State Space of CTMC for Classed Networks
Background context: The text explains how to model the state space for continuous-time Markov chains (CTMC) in classed networks. It highlights that knowing just the number of jobs at each server is insufficient; we need additional information about the classes of these jobs.

:p What is the definition of the state \( z_i \)?
??x
The state of server \( i \), denoted as \( z_i \), consists of the class and order of the packets in the queue. Specifically:

\[ z_i = (c(1)_i, c(2)_i, ..., c(n_i)_i) \]

Where:
- \( n_i \) is the number of jobs at server \( i \).
- \( c(j)_i \) denotes the class of the \( j \)-th job in the queue at server \( i \), with \( c(1)_i \) being the class of the first (serving) job, and so on.

The state of the network is then represented as:

\[ z = (z_1, z_2, ..., z_k) \]

#### Single-Server Classed Network
Background context: The text introduces a single-server classed network to understand the behavior of such networks. It considers an M/M/1 queue with multiple classes of packets.

:p What is the limiting probability \( \pi(c(1)_1, c(2)_1, ..., c(n_1)_1) \)?
??x
The limiting probability that the state of the system at server 1 is \( (c(1)_1, c(2)_1, ..., c(n_1)_1) \) can be guessed as:

\[ \pi(c(1)_1, c(2)_1, ..., c(n_1)_1) = \frac{\lambda_1^{(c(1)_1)} \lambda_1^{(c(2)_1)} ... \lambda_1^{(c(n_1)_1)}}{(\mu_1)^{n_1} (1 - \rho_1)} \]

Where:
- \( \lambda_1^{(c(i)_1)} \) is the arrival rate for class \( c(i)_1 \).
- \( \rho_1 = \frac{\lambda_1}{\mu_1} \).

This formula accounts for the probability of having specific classes in a given order at the head of the queue.

#### Proof of Limiting Probability Formula
Background context: The text provides an outline to prove that the guessed limiting probability \( \pi(c(1)_1, c(2)_1, ..., c(n_1)_1) \) satisfies the balance equations for a single-server classed network.

:p How do you verify that the guessed formula satisfies the balance equations?
??x
To verify, we need to show that the rate of leaving the state \( (c(1)_1, c(2)_1, ..., c(n_1)_1) \) equals the rate of entering this state.

Leaving the state:
- Occurs due to an arrival or a departure.
- The probability is computed as the sum over all possible transitions from one state to another.

Entering the state:
- Occurs when a new job arrives in any position, maintaining the order and class specified by \( (c(1)_1, c(2)_1, ..., c(n_1)_1) \).

The balance equations can be verified by ensuring that these rates are equal, which involves detailed combinatorial arguments and calculations.

#### Arrival and Departure Mechanisms in M/M/1 Classed Queues

**Background context:** The text describes a scenario involving an M/M/1 classed queue, where arrivals and departures are analyzed. The focus is on understanding how the system transitions between states based on job classes.

:p What is the mechanism described for transitioning from one state to another in an M/M/1 classed queue?
??x
The mechanism involves two main ways:
1. **Arrival of a New Job:** If the system is in state \((c(1)1, c(2)1, ..., c(n_1 - 1)1)\), and a job of class \(c(n_1)1\) arrives, it joins the end of the queue.
2. **Departure from the Queue:** If the system is in state \((c, c(1)1, c(2)1, ..., c(n_1)1)\) where the head of the queue has class \(c\), and a departure occurs, this job leaves the system.

The rate of leaving due to a departure from the queue can be derived as follows:
\[ \text{Rate Leave} = \pi(c(1)1, c(2)1, ..., c(n_1 - 1)1) \cdot \lambda_1 + \sum_{c} \pi(c, c(1)1, c(2)1, ..., c(n_1)1) \cdot \mu_1 \]

The rate of entering is:
\[ \text{Rate Enter} = \pi(c(1)1, c(2)1, ..., c(n_1 - 1)1) \cdot \lambda_1 / (c(n_1)1) + \sum_{c} \pi(c, c(1)1, c(2)1, ..., c(n_1)1) \cdot \mu_1 \]

By substituting and simplifying using the guess from equation \(18.2\), it is shown that:
\[ \text{Rate Leave} = \text{Rate Enter} \]
This confirms the consistency of rates leaving and entering, ensuring balance in the system.

??x
The answer involves understanding the transition between states based on arrivals and departures, with specific formulas for rate calculations. By balancing these rates, we ensure the system's equilibrium.
```java
// Simplified pseudocode to illustrate the logic:
if (currentState == (c1, c2, ..., cn-1)) {
    if (newJobClass == cn) {
        // Join end of queue with arrival
    }
} else if (currentState == (c, c1, c2, ..., cn)) {
    // Departure from head of the queue
}
```

#### Product Form Theorem for Classed Networks

**Background context:** This theorem generalizes the concept of product form solutions to classed networks of queues with multiple servers. It provides a formula for calculating the limiting probabilities \( \pi(z1, z2, ..., zk) \), where each server \(i\) can be in different states \(zi\).

:p What does Theorem 18.1 state about the limiting probabilities in a classed network of queues?
??x
Theorem 18.1 states that for a classed network with \(k\) servers, the limiting probabilities are given by:
\[ \pi(z_1, z_2, ..., z_k) = \frac{1}{\prod_{i=1}^k P(\text{state at server } i \text{ is } z_i)} \]

Where:
- \(z_i = (c(1)i, c(2)i, ..., c(ni)i)\)
- Each server behaves like an M/M/1 queue with specific states.
- The probability \(P(\text{state at server } i \text{ is } z_i)\) can be computed by summing over all other states.

The key formula for the probability of state \(zi\) at server \(i\) is:
\[ P(\text{state at server } i \text{ is } z_i) = (1 - \rho_i) \cdot \frac{\lambda_i^{n_i} / (\mu_i^{n_i})}{\sum_{j=0}^{\infty} \left( \frac{\lambda_j}{\mu_j} \right)^j} \]

Where:
- \( \rho_i = \frac{\lambda_i}{\mu_i} \) is the traffic intensity for server \(i\).

??x
The answer involves understanding that the product form solution applies to classed networks, allowing us to calculate the limiting probabilities by breaking down the network into individual servers and using their specific states.

```java
// Simplified pseudocode to illustrate the logic:
public double computeProbability(State zi) {
    int n = zi.getClasses().size();
    double lambda_i = getLambda(zi);
    double mu_i = getMu(zi);
    double rho_i = lambda_i / mu_i;
    
    return (1 - rho_i) * Math.pow(lambda_i, n) / Math.pow(mu_i, n) / calculateSum(rho_i);
}

private double calculateSum(double rho) {
    double sum = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j <= MAX_J; j++) {
        sum += Math.pow(rho, j);
    }
    return sum;
}
```

#### Calculating the Distribution of Jobs in Each Queue

**Background context:** The text provides a formula to calculate the probability distribution of jobs in each queue within a classed network. This is analogous to what was derived for unclassed Jackson networks.

:p How is the number of jobs in each queue distributed according to Corollary 18.2?
??x
Corollary 18.2 states that in a classed network, the probability distribution of \(n_i\) jobs at server \(i\) follows:
\[ P(n_{ij} \text{ jobs at server } i) = (1 - \rho_i)^{\rho_i^{n_i}} / (1 - \rho_i) \]

Where:
- \( \rho_i = \frac{\lambda_i}{\mu_i} \) is the traffic intensity for each server.
- The formula simplifies to a product form solution, where each server's state probability is independent of others.

??x
The answer involves understanding that the distribution of jobs at each queue can be calculated using the given formula. This allows us to predict the average number of jobs in each queue by considering the traffic intensity for each server.

```java
// Simplified pseudocode to illustrate the logic:
public double computeJobDistribution(int n, Server server) {
    double lambda_i = server.getArrivalRate();
    double mu_i = server.getDepartureRate();
    double rho_i = lambda_i / mu_i;
    
    return Math.pow(1 - rho_i, rho_i * (n + 1)) / (1 - rho_i);
}
```
