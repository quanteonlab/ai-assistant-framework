#### Solving Equations
Background context: To solve equations, isolate the variable by performing inverse operations. For linear equations like \(ax + b = c\), subtract or add constants and divide or multiply by coefficients to get the variable alone.
:p Solve the equation \(\frac{0.05}{x} = 1\) for \(x\).
??x
To solve \(\frac{0.05}{x} = 1\), multiply both sides of the equation by \(x\):
\[ 0.05 = x \]
Thus, \(x = 0.05\).

The answer is 0.05.

#### Quadratic Equations
Background context: A quadratic equation is in the form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\). Solving these involves factoring or using the quadratic formula. For this example, we can factor out a common term and solve for \(x\).
:p Solve the equation \(x^2 - x - 6 = 0\) for \(x\).
??x
To solve \(x^2 - x - 6 = 0\), first look for factors of \(-6\) that add up to \(-1\). The numbers are \(-3\) and \(2\):
\[ (x - 3)(x + 2) = 0 \]
Set each factor equal to zero:
\[ x - 3 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 2 = 0 \]
Solve for \(x\):
\[ x = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2 \]

The answers are \(x = 3\) or \(x = -2\).

#### Right Triangles
Background context: A right triangle has one angle that measures exactly 90 degrees. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.
:p Identify a property of a right triangle.
??x
A right triangle has one 90-degree angle.

The answer is that it has one 90-degree angle.

#### Exponentiation
Background context: When multiplying a number by itself multiple times, exponents are used. For example, \(a^3 = a \times a \times a\). Exponential properties allow simplification of expressions involving powers.
:p Simplify the expression \(x^{2+2}\).
??x
Using the property that when you multiply two exponents with the same base, you add their exponents:
\[ x^{2+2} = x^4 \]

The answer is \(x^4\).

#### Power Calculation: Current and Voltage
Background context: Power (P) in an electrical system can be calculated using the formula P = I * V, where I is current and V is voltage.

:p How do you calculate power when given the current and voltage?
??x
To calculate power, use the formula \( P = I \times V \). In this case, if \( I = 1200 \) amperes and \( V = 120 \) volts, then the power is \( 1200 \times 120 = 144,000 \) watts or 144 kilowatts.

#### Calculating Areas and Volumes of Geometric Shapes
Background context: This involves using geometric formulas to calculate areas and volumes. The key is recognizing the correct formula based on the shape given.

:p What’s the area of a circle with a diameter of 10 inches?
??x
The radius \(r\) of the circle is half the diameter, so:
\[
r = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ inches}.
\]
Use the formula for the area of a circle, \(A = \pi r^2\):
\[
A = \pi (5)^2 = 25\pi.
\]

: Calculate the volume of a cube with a side length of 4 inches.
??x
The volume \(V\) of a cube is given by:
\[
V = s^3,
\]
where \(s\) is the side length. For this problem, \(s = 4\):
\[
V = 4^3 = 64 \text{ cubic inches}.
\]
