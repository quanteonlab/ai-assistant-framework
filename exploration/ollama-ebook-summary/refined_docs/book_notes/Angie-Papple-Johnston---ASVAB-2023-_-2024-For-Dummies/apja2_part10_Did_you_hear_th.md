#### The Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics

Background context: This law states that if two systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third system, they must be in thermal equilibrium with each other. It is essential for defining temperature and serves as the basis for many thermodynamic principles.

:p What does the zeroth law of thermodynamics state?
??x
The zeroth law of thermodynamics states that if two systems (A and B) are both in thermal equilibrium with a third system (C), then A and B must also be in thermal equilibrium with each other. This definition is crucial for understanding temperature.
```java
public class ThermodynamicSystems {
    public boolean areInEquilibrium(double tempA, double tempB, double tempC) {
        return tempA == tempB && tempB == tempC;
    }
}
```

#### Force Formula
Background context: The force ($F $) acting on an object can be determined using Newton's second law of motion. According to this law, force equals mass ($ m $) times acceleration ($ a $), expressed as$\vec{F} = m\vec{a}$.

:p What formula is used to determine the force?
??x
The formula used to determine the force is $\vec{F} = m\vec{a}$. This means that the force acting on an object is directly proportional to its mass and the acceleration it experiences.

#### Force Calculation
Background context explaining Newton's second law of motion which states that force equals mass times acceleration ($F = m \times a$). This relationship helps determine how much force is exerted on an object.

:p How do you calculate the force exerted on an object?
??x
You calculate the force using the formula $F = m \times a $, where $ m $is the mass of the object and$ a$ is its acceleration.
