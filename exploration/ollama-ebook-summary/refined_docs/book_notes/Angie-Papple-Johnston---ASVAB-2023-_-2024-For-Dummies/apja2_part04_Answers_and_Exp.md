#### Order of Operations

Background context: The order of operations (PEMDAS) is a set of rules to solve mathematical expressions, ensuring that calculations are done in the correct sequence.

:p What does PEMDAS stand for and what is its purpose?
??x
PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). Its purpose is to ensure that mathematical expressions are solved correctly by providing a standardized order of operations.

For example:

\[
64 - 12 + 2 \times 7
\]

Using PEMDAS, you would first handle the multiplication and then proceed with addition and subtraction from left to right:

\[
= 64 - 12 + 14
\]
\[
= 52 + 14
\]
\[
= 66
\]

#### Dividing Decimals

Background context: Dividing decimals can be simplified by moving the decimal point to make the division involve whole numbers. This method avoids complex calculations.

:p How do you divide \(7120\) by \(0.005\) without a calculator?
??x
To divide 7120 by 0.005, move the decimal point three places to the right in both the dividend and divisor:

\[
7120 \div 0.005 = 7120000 \div 5 = 1424
\]

So, \(7120 \div 0.005 = 1424\).

??x
To divide 7120 by 0.005 without a calculator, move the decimal point three places to the right in both numbers, resulting in 7120000 divided by 5, which equals 1424.

#### Meeting Points
Problems involving meeting points often require setting up equations based on the distances and speeds of two objects traveling towards each other or away from each other.

:p Ayanna and Cori are driving to meet. How long will it take them to meet if their combined speed is 135 miles per hour?
??x
Let \( t \) be the time in hours until they meet:
- Distance Ayanna travels: \( 65t \)
- Distance Cori travels: \( 70t \)

Total distance covered:

\[ 65t + 70t = 135t \]

Since their combined speed is 135 miles per hour, the equation simplifies to:

\[ 135t = 270 \]
\[ t = \frac{270}{135} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take them 2 hours to meet.

#### Irrational Numbers
Irrational numbers cannot be represented as a simple fraction.

:p What is an irrational number?
??x An irrational number cannot be expressed as the quotient or ratio of two integers. Its decimal form neither terminates nor repeats. Examples include \(\pi\), \(\sqrt{2}\).

#### Maintaining Balance in Equations
Equations must remain balanced when performing algebraic operations.

:p How do you solve an equation while keeping it balanced?
??x To solve an equation, perform the same operation on both sides. For instance, if \(30 = 5x\), divide both sides by 5 to get \(6 = x\). This keeps the equation balanced.

#### Solving Multi-Step Equations
Background context: Multi-step equations require performing multiple inverse operations to isolate the variable. The goal is to get the variable on one side of the equation by moving terms from one side to another and using appropriate inverse operations like subtraction or addition, followed by division or multiplication.

:p How do you solve \( 3x + x = 9 \)?
??x
First, combine like terms:
\[ 3x + x = 4x \]
The equation now is:
\[ 4x = 9 \]

Next, perform the inverse operation of multiplication by dividing both sides by 4:
\[ \frac{4x}{4} = \frac{9}{4} \]
This simplifies to:
\[ x = \frac{9}{4} \]

To verify the solution, substitute \( x = \frac{9}{4} \) back into the original equation:
\[ 3\left(\frac{9}{4}\right) + \frac{9}{4} = \frac{27}{4} + \frac{9}{4} = \frac{36}{4} = 9 \]
The answer is correct as both sides are equal.

#### Simplifying Algebraic Expressions
Background context: Before evaluating or solving algebraic expressions, it's essential to simplify them. Simplification involves removing parentheses using the distributive property, combining like terms, and combining constants.

:p How do you simplify \( 3x^2 + 4 - (2x^2 + x) \)?
??x
First, remove the parentheses by distributing the negative sign:
\[ 3x^2 + 4 - 2x^2 - x \]

Combine like terms. The \( x^2 \) terms are \( 3x^2 \) and \( -2x^2 \), which combine to give \( x^2 \):
\[ (3x^2 - 2x^2) + 4 - x = x^2 + 4 - x \]

The simplified expression is:
\[ x^2 - x + 4 \]

To verify, check if substituting values into the original and simplified expressions gives the same result. For example, let \( x = 1 \):
Original: \( 3(1)^2 + 4 - (2(1)^2 + 1) = 3 + 4 - (2 + 1) = 7 - 3 = 4 \)
Simplified: \( 1^2 - 1 + 4 = 1 - 1 + 4 = 4 \)

The answers are the same, confirming the simplification is correct.
