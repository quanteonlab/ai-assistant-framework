#### Reading the Entire Problem
Background context explaining the importance of reading the entire problem thoroughly and understanding its context. This step helps form a mental picture or draw sketches to visualize the problem, making it easier to identify relevant information.

:p How do you approach solving word problems initially?
??x
Start by reading the entire problem completely to understand what it is about. Form a mental picture of the problem or draw a sketch on scratch paper if needed. Ask yourself if this type of problem has been encountered before and how it was solved.

#### Figuring Out What the Question is Asking
Background context explaining that determining exactly what the question is asking is crucial, as sometimes the question might be indirectly stated. Clue words can help identify the nature of the required calculation (e.g., addition: sum, total; division: share, ratio).

:p How do you determine what a word problem is asking for?
??x
Identify and focus on the specific question being asked in the problem. Sometimes, the question might not be directly stated but can be inferred from the context or clue words. Common clue words include:
- Addition: sum, total, in all, perimeter, increased by, combined, added
- Division: share, distribute, ratio, quotient, average, per, out of, percent
- Equals: is, was, are, were, amounts to
- Multiplication: product, total, area, cubic, times, multiplied by, of
- Subtraction: difference, how much more, exceed, less than, fewer than, decreased

The problem might be indirectly stated, so look for these clues to understand the actual question.

#### Digging for the Facts
Background context explaining that after identifying what the question is, you need to determine which data are relevant and which are not. List all facts provided in the problem with their units of measurement.

:p How do you identify relevant information in a word problem?
??x
List all the given information and variables from the problem on your scratch paper. Attach any units of measurement (e.g., miles, feet, inches). Then, cross out or ignore data that are not relevant to the question at hand.

For example:
- Tom sold 15 candy bars
- Becky sold 12 candy bars
- Debbie sold 17 candy bars
- Jane sold the most at 50

The question is: How many candy bars did Becky, Debbie, and Jane sell? Therefore, Tom's sales are irrelevant and can be crossed out.

The relevant facts are:
- Becky 12 bars
- Debbie 17 bars
- Jane 50 bars

Summing the remaining bars gives you the answer.

#### Isolating Unknowns in Equations

Background context explaining the concept. Sometimes, word problems require you to isolate unknown variables within equations.

If applicable, add code examples with explanations:
```java
public class IsolateUnknownExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double totalSavings = 15000.0;
        int yearsToSave = 3;

        // Calculate annual savings required
        double annualSavingsRequired = totalSavings / yearsToSave;
        System.out.println("Joan needs to save $" + annualSavingsRequired + " each year.");
    }
}
```
:p How do you isolate an unknown variable in the equation $ym = \$15,000 $ when$y = 3$?
??x
To solve for $m$, we start with the equation:

$$
y \times m = \$15,000
$$Given that $ y = 3$:

$$
3 \times m = \$15,000
$$We need to isolate $ m$. To do this, divide both sides of the equation by 3:

$$
m = \frac{\$15,000}{3}
$$Performing the division gives us:
$$
m = \$5,000
$$So, Joan needs to save$5,000 each year.

#### Reviewing Your Answer
Background context: When answering math word problems, it is crucial to review your solution before finalizing your answer. This process helps ensure accuracy and relevance to the question asked.

:p Does reviewing your answer help catch mistakes?
??x
Yes, reviewing your answer can help catch common mistakes such as misreading units or performing incorrect calculations. It also ensures that you are answering the specific question being asked.

---


#### Probable Solution Check
Background context: To ensure the solution makes sense, one should check if it seems probable and reasonable in a real-world scenario. This step helps verify whether the answer is logical and feasible.

:p Does checking for probability help identify mistakes?
??x
Yes, checking for probability can help identify mistakes such as an impractical number of shingles needed to cover a roof or incorrect units used.

---


#### Double-Checking Your Answer
Background context: Double-checking your answer can help catch simple errors and ensure that you have arrived at the correct solution. Test-makers often include answers close to the right one as distractors.

:p Why is double-checking important?
??x
Double-checking is crucial because it helps identify simple calculation or logical errors that could lead to incorrect answers, especially when test questions are designed with misleading options.

#### Backtracking Steps
Background context: If your initial solution does not fit the facts presented in the problem, it is essential to backtrack through your steps until you arrive at a probable and correct answer.

:p What should you do if your answer seems incorrect?
??x
If your answer seems incorrect, back up and go through each step again. This process can help identify where you made a mistake and lead you to a more accurate solution that fits the problem’s context.
