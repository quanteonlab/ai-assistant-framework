#### Forces and Vector Quantities
Background context: Forces are vector quantities, which means they have both magnitude (size) and direction. This concept is crucial when analyzing interactions between objects. When forces act in the same direction, their magnitudes add up; when they act in opposite directions, their magnitudes subtract from each other.
:p What does it mean for a force to be a vector quantity?
??x
A vector quantity has both magnitude and direction. In the context of forces, this means that not only do we need to consider how strong a force is (its magnitude), but also in which direction it acts.

#### Work and Energy
Background context: Work is the result of a force (usually in pounds) moving over a distance (usually in feet). In the US, work is often measured as foot-pounds. Potential energy is stored energy due to an object's position or state, while kinetic energy is the energy of motion.

:p Define what constitutes work in mechanical terms.
??x
Work is defined as the result of a force overcoming resistance over a distance. It can be mathematically represented by the formula:

\[ \text{Work} = \text{Force} \times \text{Distance} \]

In the US, this is often measured in foot-pounds (1 foot-pound occurs when 1 pound moves 1 foot). The unit of work here is the foot-pound.

For example:
```java
public class Work {
    public static final double GAIN_IN_FOOT_POUNDS = 1; // 1 foot-pound of work

    public static void calculateWork(double force, double distance) {
        System.out.println("Work done: " + (force * distance) + " foot-pounds");
    }
}
```

#### Work and Force
Work is defined as a force acting on an object over a distance (displacement). It involves both force and displacement, making it easier to understand through practical scenarios. For example, lifting a barbell involves applying force over a certain height.
:p What are the two main ingredients in work according to physics?
??x
The two main ingredients in work are force and displacement. These must be present for work to occur; when you lift a barbell, you apply force over a distance (height), thus doing work on it.
