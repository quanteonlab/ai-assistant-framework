#### Example Problem with Substitution Method
Background context: An example problem shows how the substitution method can be used in a simple two-variable system of equations where one equation is easily solved for one variable.
:p Solve the following system using the substitution method:
\[ x + y = 3 \]
\[ xy = 7 \]
??x
First, solve \( x + y = 3 \) for \( y \):
\[ y = 3 - x \]

Substitute this expression into the second equation:
\[ x(3 - x) = 7 \]
\[ 3x - x^2 = 7 \]
\[ x^2 - 3x + 7 = 0 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 1 \] (by substituting and solving the quadratic equation)

Substitute \( x = 1 \) back into \( y = 3 - x \):
\[ y = 3 - 1 = 2 \]

Thus, \( x = 1 \) and \( y = 2 \).

#### Factoring Algebra Expressions
Factoring involves breaking down a product (result of multiplication) into its original factors. This process is useful for simplifying expressions and solving equations.

:p What does factoring involve?
??x Factoring involves breaking down a product into its original factors, which were multiplied together to produce the given product.

#### Solving Inequalities: Basic Rules
Background context: Inequalities involve expressions where one side is not equal to the other. The goal is to find values that make the inequality true.
:p How do you solve an inequality like \(3 - 4x > 8\)?
??x
First, isolate the variable by subtracting 3 from both sides:
\[ 3 - 4x - 3 > 8 - 3 \Rightarrow -4x > 5 \]

Next, divide both sides by \(-4\). Remember to reverse the inequality sign because you are dividing by a negative number:
\[ x < -\frac{5}{4} \]

So, \(x\) must be less than \(-\frac{5}{4}\).

#### Solving Inequalities with Negative Numbers
Background context: When solving inequalities involving multiplication or division by negative numbers, the inequality sign reverses.
:p What happens when you solve an inequality like \(\frac{x - 2}{-3} < -1\)?
??x
First, eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by \(-3\). Remember to reverse the inequality sign:
\[ x - 2 > 3 \]

Next, isolate \(x\) by adding 2 to both sides:
\[ x > 5 \]

So, \(x\) must be greater than 5.
