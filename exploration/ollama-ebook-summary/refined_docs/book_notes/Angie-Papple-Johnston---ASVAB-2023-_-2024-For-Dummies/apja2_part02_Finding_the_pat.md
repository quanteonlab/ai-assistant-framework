#### Square Root

Square root is a fundamental mathematical operation where you find a number that, when multiplied by itself (squared), equals the original number. For example, the square root of 36 is 6 because \(6 \times 6 = 36\).

:p What is the definition of the square root?
??x
The square root of a number is the value that, when squared, gives you the original number.

#### Problem-Solving with Order of Operations
To solve a problem like \( 3 \times (5 + 2) - 6^2 + 8 \), you follow these steps:

1. **Parentheses**: Solve inside the parentheses first: \( 5 + 2 = 7 \).
2. **Exponents**: Evaluate any exponents next: \( 6^2 = 36 \).
3. **Multiplication and Division**: Perform multiplication from left to right: \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \).
4. **Addition and Subtraction**: Finally, perform addition and subtraction from left to right: \( 21 - 36 + 8 \).

:p What is the solution for the problem \( 3 \times (5 + 2) - 6^2 + 8 \)?
??x
The solution for the problem \( 3 \times (5 + 2) - 6^2 + 8 \) involves following these steps:
1. Solve inside the parentheses: \( 5 + 2 = 7 \).
2. Evaluate the exponent: \( 6^2 = 36 \).
3. Multiply: \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \).
4. Subtract and add from left to right: \( 21 - 36 + 8 \).

The final result is \( -7 \). This ensures that the operations are performed correctly according to the order of operations.

#### Median Concept
Background context explaining the median. The median is the middle value in a set of ordered numbers, and it can be found by arranging numbers from smallest to largest.
:p How do you find the median in a set of numbers?
??x
To find the median, first, order the numbers from smallest to largest. Then, identify the number that splits the list into two halves; this is the median.
For example, for the data set 47, 56, 58, 63, 100, arrange them in order: 47, 56, 58, 63, 100. The middle number, 58, is the median.

#### Dividing with Percents
Background context: When dividing percents, first convert them to decimals or fractions and then apply the division operation. This process is often used in financial calculations, such as determining interest rates or discounts.
:p If you have an increase of 25% on a number, how do you calculate it?
??x
To calculate an increase of 25%:
1. Convert 25% to its decimal form: 25% = 0.25.
2. Multiply the original number by this decimal: If the original number is \( N \), then the increased value is \( N * (1 + 0.25) = N * 1.25 \).
Therefore, a 25% increase on any number \( N \) results in multiplying it by 1.25.
