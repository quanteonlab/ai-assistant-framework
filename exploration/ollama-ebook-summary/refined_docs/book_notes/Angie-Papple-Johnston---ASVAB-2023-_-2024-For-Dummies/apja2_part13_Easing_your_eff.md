#### Levers and Mechanical Advantage
Levers are simple machines that work by using a fulcrum to reduce resistance and multiply the effect of effort. The mechanical advantage (MA) of a lever is determined by:

\[ \text{Mechanical Advantage} = \frac{\text{Length of Effort Arm}}{\text{Length of Resistance Arm}} \]

- Effort arm: Distance from the fulcrum where effort is applied.
- Resistance arm: Distance from the fulcrum where resistance is applied.

The longer the effort arm compared to the resistance arm, the greater the mechanical advantage.

:p What is a lever and how does it work?
??x
A lever works by using a fulcrum (a pivot point) to reduce the force needed to move an object. It has three main parts:
- Effort: The input force applied.
- Fulcrum: The support point around which the lever rotates.
- Load/Resistance: The weight that needs to be moved.

The mechanical advantage can be calculated using:

\[ \text{Mechanical Advantage} = \frac{\text{Length of Effort Arm}}{\text{Length of Resistance Arm}} \]

For example, if an effort arm is 6 inches and a resistance arm is 3 inches, the MA would be 2.

```java
public class LeverMechanics {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double effortArm = 6; // in inches
        double resistanceArm = 3; // in inches
        double mechanicalAdvantage = effortArm / resistanceArm;
        System.out.println("Mechanical Advantage: " + mechanicalAdvantage);
    }
}
```

#### Inclined Plane
An inclined plane, also known as a ramp, is another simple machine that makes moving an object easier. It spreads the work over a longer distance, reducing the force needed to do the work.

\[ \text{Mechanical Advantage} = \frac{\text{Length of Ramp}}{\text{Height of Ramp}} \]

:p What is an inclined plane and how does it work?
??x
An inclined plane or ramp makes moving heavy objects easier by spreading out the effort over a longer distance. For example, to lift a 50-pound barrel 3 feet using a 6-foot long ramp, you would only need half as much force (25 pounds) because the mechanical advantage is 2.

```java
public class InclinedPlaneExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double lengthOfRamp = 6; // in feet
        double heightOfRamp = 3; // in feet
        double mechanicalAdvantage = lengthOfRamp / heightOfRamp;
        System.out.println("Mechanical Advantage: " + mechanicalAdvantage);
    }
}
```

#### Torque in Action
Background context: Torque is a twisting or turning force that tends to cause rotation around an axis. It’s commonly used in everyday scenarios like opening doors, steering cars, and even pedal bikes.

:p What are some real-world examples of torque?
??x
Real-world examples include:
- Opening a door by pushing on its edge (away from the hinges)
- Steering a car using the steering wheel
- Pedaling a bicycle
```
public class Torque {
    public static void calculateTorque(double force, double leverArm) {
        // Torque is calculated as Force * Lever Arm
        System.out.println("Calculated Torque: " + (force * leverArm));
    }
}
```

#### State of Equilibrium

When multiple forces interact and their combination cancels out, there's a state of equilibrium where the velocity (speed and direction) of an object does not change.

:p What is equilibrium in physics?
??x
Equilibrium in physics occurs when two or more interacting forces cancel each other out. In this state, the velocity (both speed and direction) of an object remains unchanged.

#### Momentum Calculation

Momentum depends on both mass and velocity. The heavier ball with more mass will have more momentum and upon impact, it will slow down but continue in the same direction and knock the lighter ball backward.

:p How does mass affect momentum?
??x
Mass affects momentum significantly; objects with greater mass have higher momentum. In this case, the larger (heavier) ball has more momentum due to its increased mass.
