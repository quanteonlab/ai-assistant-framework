#### Rate as Division
Background context: In a rate, you can generally think of "per" as a division sign. For example, if someone drives 141 miles in 3 hours and needs to find the average speed, you want the rate of speed in miles per hour.

:p What is the formula for calculating the average speed?
??x
To calculate the average speed, you divide the total distance by the total time.
\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}
\]
For example:
```python
distance = 141  # miles
time = 3        # hours
speed = distance / time  # Result: 47.0 miles/hour
```

#### Solving Partially and Guessing the Rest

When faced with complex problems requiring multiple steps, tackle what you can first. For example, if you don't remember how to multiply decimals, simplify the problem by focusing on the multiplication of simpler numbers.

:p Consider this question: What's the value of \(0.03 \times 0.03\)?
??x
First, recognize that multiplying 0.03 and 0.03 is essentially finding \(3 \times 3 = 9\). Then, consider the decimal places: there are six total places after the decimal in both numbers, so place the decimal point in your answer to make it have six places. This gives you 0.000027.

#### Using Process of Elimination

If you’re unsure about how to solve a problem, try plugging the given choices back into the equation. This can help you identify the correct answer even if you don’t know the exact solution method.

:p Solve for \(x\): \(x^5 = 32\).
??x
Plugging in each option:
- (A) \(5^5 \neq 32\)
- (B) \(32^5\) is much larger than 32
- (C) \(32^5\) is also not equal to 32
- (D) \(37^5\) doesn’t fit, but checking simpler values like \(2^5 = 32\).

So the correct answer is Choice (D).

#### Finding the Average

Background context: The average (or mean) of a set of numbers is found by summing all the values and dividing by the number of values. For example, if you have \(n\) numbers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\), their average is:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n}{n}
\]

:p What is the average of 101, 15, 62, 84, and 55?
??x
To find the average:
1. Sum all the numbers: \(101 + 15 + 62 + 84 + 55 = 317\).
2. Divide by the number of values (which is 5):
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{317}{5} = 63.4
\]
Therefore, the average is \(63.4\).

#### Large Number Division

Background context: Dividing large numbers involves performing long division by aligning digits and dividing step by step.

:p Solve: 6,412,182 ÷ 72
??x
To divide \(6,412,182\) by \(72\):
1. Perform the division:
   - First, determine how many times 72 goes into 64 (the first three digits): 
     \[
     640 \div 72 = 8 \text{ remainder } 56
     \]
   - Bring down the next digit (1) to make it 561. Determine how many times 72 goes into 561:
     \[
     561 \div 72 = 7 \text{ remainder } 47
     \]
   - Bring down the next digit (2) to make it 472. Determine how many times 72 goes into 472:
     \[
     472 \div 72 = 6 \text{ remainder } 36
     \]
   - Bring down the last digit (8), making it 368. Determine how many times 72 goes into 368:
     \[
     368 \div 72 = 5 \text{ remainder } 13
     \]
   - Bring down the next digit (2) to make it 132. Determine how many times 72 goes into 132:
     \[
     132 \div 72 = 1 \text{ remainder } 60
     \]

Therefore, the quotient is \(89031\) with a remainder of 54.
