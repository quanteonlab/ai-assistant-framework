#### Roots and Powers
Background context: This problem involves finding roots and understanding how they relate to powers.

:p What is the fourth root of 16?
??x
The fourth root of a number \( n \) can be expressed as:

\[ \sqrt[4]{n} = n^{1/4} \]

For 16:

\[ \sqrt[4]{16} = 16^{1/4} = (2^4)^{1/4} = 2 \]

\( 2 \)

#### Linear Equations
Background context: This problem involves finding the equation of a line passing through two given points. The general form is \( y = mx + b \), where \( m \) is the slope and \( b \) is the y-intercept.

:p What is the equation of a line that passes through the points (0, –1) and (2, 3)?
??x
First, calculate the slope \( m \):

\[ m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{3 - (-1)}{2 - 0} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Using the point (0, –1), we can find \( b \):

\[ y = mx + b \]
\[ -1 = 2(0) + b \Rightarrow b = -1 \]

Thus, the equation is:

\[ y = 2x - 1 \]

\( y = 2x - 1 \)

#### Exponent Rules
Background context: This problem tests understanding of exponent rules and simplification.

:p Simplify \( x^3 \cdot x^4 \).
??x
Using the property of exponents that states:

\[ a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n} \]

For \( x^3 \cdot x^4 \):

\[ x^3 \cdot x^4 = x^{3+4} = x^7 \]

\( x^7 \)

#### Ohm's Law
Background context: Ohm's law is a fundamental principle in electrical circuits that relates voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R). It states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points, and inversely proportional to the resistance between them. The formula for Ohm's Law is V = I * R.
:p What does Ohm's law state?
??x
Ohm's law states that Voltage (V) equals Current (I) times Resistance (R).
V = I * R

#### Rectification Process
Background context: Changing AC to DC is called rectification. This process is essential in many electronic devices where only DC power is required.
:p What term describes changing AC to DC?
??x
Changing AC to DC is called rectification.

---


#### Current Definition
Background context: Current is the rate at which electric charge flows through a conductor. It is measured in amperes (A). The definition of current can vary, but the most accurate is the presence of electron flow.
:p What is the correct definition of current?
??x
The correct definition of current is the presence of electron flow.

#### Active Element Identification
Background context: An active element in an electronic circuit is a component that can control the flow of current using non-electrical means, such as voltage or power supply. It includes elements like power supplies and operational amplifiers.
:p Which one of the following is an active element?
??x
A 10 V power supply is an active element.

#### Understanding the Question Structure
Background context: Each question includes one initial drawing that presents a problem, and four additional drawings that propose possible solutions. You need to analyze these drawings to determine which solution best addresses the issue shown in the first drawing.

:p What does each Assembling Objects question consist of?
??x
Each Assembling Objects question consists of one initial drawing presenting a problem and four additional drawings proposing possible solutions.
