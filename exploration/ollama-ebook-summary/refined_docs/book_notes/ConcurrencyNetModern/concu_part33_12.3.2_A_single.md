#### Single Producer/Multiple Consumer Pattern
Background context: The TPL Dataflow (TPLD) BufferBlock supports a single producer/multiple consumer pattern, which is useful when the producer can generate data faster than consumers can process it. This pattern leverages multiple cores to improve processing efficiency.

If the producer generates more items than the consumers can handle in real-time, buffering ensures that the consumers are not overwhelmed with too much work at once. Buffering also allows for parallel consumption of messages by multiple blocks.
:p How does TPL Dataflow support a single producer/multiple consumer pattern?
??x
TPL Dataflow supports this pattern through the `BufferBlock<T>` class. By setting the `MaxDegreeOfParallelism` property, you can control how many consumers are processing items concurrently. Each buffer block can hold messages temporarily in its internal buffer until space becomes available or a maximum capacity is reached.
```csharp
BufferBlock<int> buffer = new BufferBlock<int>(
    new DataFlowBlockOptions {
        BoundedCapacity = 10,
        MaxDegreeOfParallelism = Environment.ProcessorCount
    }
);
```

#### Enabling an Agent Model in C# Using TPL Dataflow
Background context: In certain scenarios, maintaining a shared state across threads is necessary. However, this can lead to concurrency issues if not handled properly. TPL Dataflow (TPLD) encapsulates state within blocks and uses channels for inter-block communication, ensuring safe mutation of shared states.
:p What is the advantage of using TPL Dataflow for implementing an agent model in C#?
??x
The advantage lies in the fact that TPL Dataflow encapsulates state inside the blocks. This allows for isolated mutation, making it easier to handle asynchronous computations combined with mutable state without running into concurrent issues. Channels between blocks serve as dependencies, ensuring safe communication.
```csharp
class StatefulDataFlowAgent<TState, TMessage> : IAgent<TMessage>
{
    private TState state;
    private readonly ActionBlock<TMessage> actionBlock;

    public StatefulDataFlowAgent(
        TState initialState,
        Func<TState, TMessage, Task<TState>> action,
        CancellationTokenSource cts = null
    )
    {
        state = initialState;
        var options = new ExecutionDataFlowBlockOptions
        {
            CancellationToken = cts?.Token ?? CancellationToken.None
        };
        actionBlock = new ActionBlock<TMessage>(
            async msg => state = await action(state, msg), options);
    }

    public Task Send(TMessage message) => actionBlock.SendAsync(message);
    public void Post(TMessage message) => actionBlock.Post(message);
}
```

#### Stateful vs. Stateless
Background context: Stateless agents maintain no internal state and process each request independently based on the new information provided. On the other hand, stateful agents store an internal state that can change as messages are processed.
:p What is the difference between a stateless and a stateful agent in TPL Dataflow?
??x
A stateless agent processes each message independently without maintaining any internal state. In contrast, a stateful agent maintains an internal state that can be modified by processing incoming messages. This state allows for more complex behavior where past interactions affect future actions.
```csharp
class StatefulDataFlowAgent<TState, TMessage> : IAgent<TMessage>
{
    private TState state;
    private readonly ActionBlock<TMessage> actionBlock;

    public StatefulDataFlowAgent(
        TState initialState,
        Func<TState, TMessage, Task<TState>> action,
        CancellationTokenSource cts = null
    )
    {
        state = initialState;
        var options = new ExecutionDataFlowBlockOptions
        {
            CancellationToken = cts?.Token ?? CancellationToken.None
        };
        actionBlock = new ActionBlock<TMessage>(
            async msg => state = await action(state, msg), options);
    }

    public Task Send(TMessage message) => actionBlock.SendAsync(message);
    public void Post(TMessage message) => actionBlock.Post(message);
}
```

#### Implementation of StatefulDataFlowAgent
Background context: The `StatefulDataFlowAgent` class encapsulates a TPL Dataflow ActionBlock to handle stateful processing. It uses an action function that processes messages and updates the internal state.
:p How does the `StatefulDataFlowAgent` implement stateful behavior using TPL Dataflow?
??x
The `StatefulDataFlowAgent` implements stateful behavior by maintaining a current state through a polymorphic and mutable value `TState`. Each message processed updates this state, ensuring that subsequent messages are handled based on the updated state. The agent processes messages sequentially to avoid concurrent issues.
```csharp
class StatefulDataFlowAgent<TState, TMessage> : IAgent<TMessage>
{
    private TState state;
    private readonly ActionBlock<TMessage> actionBlock;

    public StatefulDataFlowAgent(
        TState initialState,
        Func<TState, TMessage, Task<TState>> action,
        CancellationTokenSource cts = null
    )
    {
        state = initialState;
        var options = new ExecutionDataFlowBlockOptions
        {
            CancellationToken = cts?.Token ?? CancellationToken.None
        };
        actionBlock = new ActionBlock<TMessage>(
            async msg => state = await action(state, msg), options);
    }

    public Task Send(TMessage message) => actionBlock.SendAsync(message);
    public void Post(TMessage message) => actionBlock.Post(message);
}
```

#### State Management in TPL Dataflow Agents
Background context explaining how state is managed in the `StatefulDataFlowAgent`. The state is passed as an argument to the action function and is used to cache results of operations.

:p How does the agent manage its state in this example?
??x
The agent manages its state by passing it as an argument to the action function. This ensures that changes in state are captured, allowing for caching results of operations such as downloading web content.

Example:
```csharp
var agentStateful = Agent.Start(ImmutableDictionary<string, string>.Empty,
                                async (state, url) => 
                                {
                                    if (!state.TryGetValue(url, out string content))
                                    {
                                        using (var webClient = new WebClient())
                                        {
                                            content = await webClient.DownloadStringTaskAsync(url);
                                            await File.WriteAllTextAsync(createFileNameFromUrl(url), content);
                                        }
                                    }
                                    return state.Add(url, content);
                                });
```

#### Counter Agent Logic
Background context: The `counter` agent is responsible for counting occurrences of words. It updates its internal state based on the words it receives and returns a count.

:p What does the counter agent do when it receives a word?
??x
The counter agent updates its internal state by incrementing the count of each word received. If the word is new, it initializes the count to 1.
```csharp
IAgent<string> counter = Agent.Start(ImmutableDictionary<string, int>.Empty,
    (state, word) =>
    {
        printer.Post("counter received message");
        int count;
        if (state.TryGetValue(word, out count))
            return state.Add(word, count++);
        else
            return state.Add(word, 1);
    },
    (state, word) => (state, (word, state[word])));
```

#### Asynchronous Pipeline with TPL Dataflow
Background context: This example demonstrates how to use `TPL Dataflow` and agents for parallel processing, showing the interaction between different agents in a pipeline.

:p How does the overall word counting system work?
??x
The overall system works by using three agents: `reader`, `parser`, and `counter`. The `reader` reads files, sends lines to the `parser`, which splits them into words and sends to the `counter` for counting. This setup allows efficient parallel processing.
```csharp
IAgent<string> reader = Agent.Start(async (string filePath) =>
{
    await printer.Send("reader received message");
    var lines = await File.ReadAllLinesAsync(filePath);
    lines.ForEach(async line => await parser.Send(line));
});
```

**Rating: 8/10**

#### Reader Agent's Operation
Background context: The reader agent reads files and sends each line to a parser. This operation is asynchronous and uses `File.ReadAllLinesAsync` for reading files.
:p How does the reader agent process file content?
??x
The reader agent asynchronously reads all lines from a given file path using `await File.ReadAllLinesAsync(filePath)`. It then processes each line by sending it to the parser, ensuring that this operation is asynchronous and non-blocking.
```csharp
var lines = await File.ReadAllLinesAsync(filePath);
lines.ForEach(async line => await parser.Send(line));
```
x??

---

**Rating: 8/10**

#### Counter Agent's State Management
Background context: The counter agent uses an `ImmutableDictionary` to store words and their counts. This ensures the state is thread-safe and immutable, allowing for shared use across threads.
:p What makes the counter agent's state management unique?
??x
The counter agent's state is managed using an `ImmutableDictionary`, which provides a thread-safe way of storing word counts without worrying about internal state corruption or inconsistencies. This design allows multiple threads to access and update the state safely.
```csharp
private readonly ImmutableDictionary<string, int> state;
```

**Rating: 8/10**

#### Asynchronous Operations in TPL Dataflow
Background context: The use of `await` and asynchronous methods like `Send`, `Ask`, and file operations (`ReadAllLinesAsync`) ensures that the system can handle operations without blocking threads.
:p What is the importance of using asynchronous methods in this scenario?
??x
Using asynchronous methods (e.g., `await File.ReadAllLinesAsync(filePath)`, `await parser.Send(line)`, and `await counter.Send(word)` ensures non-blocking, efficient handling of file reading and inter-agent communication. This allows the system to process multiple tasks concurrently without waiting for I/O operations.
```csharp
var lines = await File.ReadAllLinesAsync(filePath);
lines.ForEach(async line => await parser.Send(line));
```

#### Ask Method and Two-Way Communication
This section explains how to implement a method that sends a message asynchronously and waits for a response. The `Ask` method is crucial for enabling two-way communication between an agent and its sender.

:p How does the `Ask` method facilitate asynchronous interaction in agents?
??x
The `Ask` method allows sending a message to an agent and waiting asynchronously for a response by leveraging a `TaskCompletionSource<TReply>`. When creating the message, the sender passes an instance of `TaskCompletionSource<TReply>` into the payload. The `Ask` function returns this object to the caller, providing a channel to communicate back to the sender through a callback once the computation is ready.

The key components are:
- `Func<TState, TMessage, Task<TState>>`: Processes each message in combination with the current state and updates it.
- `Func<TState, TMessage, Task<(TState, TReply)>>`: Handles incoming messages, computes the new state, and replies to the sender using a tuple containing the new state and reply.

Example code snippet:
```csharp
public async Task<TReply> Ask(TMessage message)
{
    var taskCompletionSource = new TaskCompletionSource<TReply>();
    
    // Enqueue the message with its corresponding TCS.
    actionBlock.Post((message, SomeOption(taskCompletionSource)));
    
    // Await the result from the completion source.
    return await taskCompletionSource.Task;
}
```

#### IReplyAgent Interface and Ask Method
This concept outlines how an agent implements two-way communication using the `IReplyAgent` interface.

:p What does the `Ask` method in the `IReplyAgent` interface enable?
??x
The `Ask` method in the `IReplyAgent` interface enables sending a message to an agent and asynchronously waiting for a response. The sender passes an instance of `TaskCompletionSource<TReply>` into the message payload, which allows the agent to notify the caller when the result is ready.

Example implementation:
```csharp
public class StatefulReplyDataFlowAgent : IReplyAgent<...>
{
    public async Task<TReply> Ask(TMessage message)
    {
        var taskCompletionSource = new TaskCompletionSource<TReply>();
        
        // Enqueue the message with its corresponding TCS.
        actionBlock.Post((message, SomeOption(taskCompletionSource)));
        
        // Await the result from the completion source.
        return await taskCompletionSource.Task;
    }
}
```

#### Parallel Workflow for Compression and Encryption

The example demonstrates a scenario where a large stream of data needs to be processed in parallel. The workflow combines TDF blocks with the `StatefulReplyDataFlowAgent` to compress and encrypt data efficiently.

:p What is the purpose of using TPL Dataflow for processing a large stream?
??x
TPL Dataflow processes blocks that compose a workflow at different rates and in parallel, spreading work across multiple CPU cores. This is particularly useful for handling large streams of data where tasks can be broken down into smaller chunks that can be processed concurrently.

```csharp
public async Task ProcessLargeStreamAsync(byte[] data)
{
    // Define TDF blocks for compression and encryption
    var compressionBlock = new TransformBlock<byte[], byte[]>(data => CompressData(data));
    var encryptionBlock = new TransformBlock<byte[], byte[]>(data => EncryptData(data));

    // Connect the blocks to form a pipeline
    compressionBlock.LinkTo(encryptionBlock);

    // Process data in chunks
    for (int i = 0; i < data.Length / chunkSize; i++)
    {
        await compressionBlock.SendAsync(data[i * chunkSize..(i + 1) * chunkSize]);
    }

    // Ensure all data is processed and blocks are completed
    await Task.WhenAll(compressionBlock.Completion, encryptionBlock.Completion);
}
```

#### State Management in Agents

The `StatefulReplyDataFlowAgent` manages state that can be shared across the process function and may be mutated outside its scope. This requires careful handling to avoid unwanted behavior.

:p What are the implications of using an immutable state with TDF?
??x
Using an immutable state with TPL Dataflow (TDF) ensures that shared state is not accidentally modified, preventing bugs related to concurrent access. However, this does not guarantee isolation; states can still be mutated outside the agent's scope. Therefore, it’s crucial to restrict and control access to the shared mutable state.

```csharp
public async Task ProcessMessageAsync(TMessage msg)
{
    TState state = initialState;

    await replyOpt.Match(
        None: async () => state = await projection(state, msg),
        Some: async reply =>
        {
            (TState newState, TReply replyResult) = await ask(state, msg);
            state = newState;
            reply.SetResult(replyResult);
        }
    );
}
```

#### Chunking Routine for Large File Processing
Background context: When dealing with large files, processing or moving them as a whole can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. The challenge is exacerbated when transferring data over a network due to latency and unpredictable bandwidth issues. To overcome these limitations, one approach is to divide the file into smaller chunks that are easier to handle.

:p What is chunking in the context of large file processing?
??x
Chunking involves breaking down a large file into smaller, manageable segments called "chunks." Each chunk can then be processed individually, whether it's compressed or encrypted. This method ensures that each operation (compression and encryption) is performed on smaller data sets, making them more efficient.
```csharp
public void CompressAndEncrypt(Stream sourceStream, Stream destinationStream, int? chunkSize = 1024 * 1024)
{
    // Implementation details will be provided in subsequent cards
}
```

#### BufferBlock for Chunked Data Handling
Background context: The `BufferBlock<T>` is a type of `Block` that buffers items before passing them to the next block in the dataflow. It is useful when dealing with asynchronous operations, as it helps manage and buffer incoming chunks of bytes from the source stream.

:p What is BufferBlock used for in this scenario?
??x
The `BufferBlock<T>` is utilized to hold incoming chunks of bytes read from the source stream until they are passed to the next processing block. This buffering ensures that data can be processed in a more controlled and efficient manner, especially when dealing with asynchronous operations.
```csharp
var inputBuffer = new BufferBlock<byte[]>();
```

**Rating: 8/10**

#### Compress Function Implementation
Background context: The `Compress` function is responsible for compressing the provided byte array. This function will be called by the `TransformBlock` to handle compression before encryption.

:p What does the `Compress` function do?
??x
The `Compress` function takes a byte array as input and returns a compressed version of that data using GZip or another suitable compression algorithm.
```csharp
private static byte[] Compress(byte[] data)
{
    using (var memoryStream = new MemoryStream())
    {
        using (var gzipStream = new GZipStream(memoryStream, CompressionLevel.Optimal))
        {
            gzipStream.Write(data, 0, data.Length);
        }
        return memoryStream.ToArray();
    }
}
```

#### Asynchronous Helper Functions for Compression and Encryption
Background context: To handle large files, asynchronous functions are used for compressing and encrypting byte arrays. This approach ensures that the processing does not block the main thread, making the application more responsive.

:p What is the benefit of using asynchronous helper functions in this scenario?
??x
Using asynchronous helper functions allows the compression and encryption processes to run concurrently without blocking the main thread. This results in improved performance and responsiveness, especially when dealing with large files or network transfers.
```csharp
private static async Task<byte[]> CompressAsync(byte[] data)
{
    using (var memoryStream = new MemoryStream())
    {
        using (var gzipStream = new GZipStream(memoryStream, CompressionLevel.Optimal))
        {
            await gzipStream.WriteAsync(data, 0, data.Length);
        }
        return memoryStream.ToArray();
    }
}
```

#### Parallel Stream Compression and Encryption using TDF
Background context: This concept discusses parallel processing techniques for compressing and encrypting data streams. The goal is to leverage multiple CPU cores for efficiency, while ensuring message order integrity during transformations.

The code uses the Dataflow Block pattern from the Task Dataflow library (TDF) in C#. It sets up a pipeline with TransformBlocks for compression and encryption, using BufferBlocks to manage intermediate results.

:p What does this implementation aim to achieve?
??x
This implementation aims to efficiently compress and encrypt data streams by utilizing parallel processing. It ensures that multiple CPU cores can work on different chunks of the data simultaneously while maintaining the correct order of messages passed between transformations.

The key components include:
- A `BufferBlock` for managing input data.
- A `TransformBlock` for asynchronous compression, which runs in parallel with other instances due to its high degree of parallelism.
- Another `TransformBlock` for encrypting the compressed data, also running in parallel.
- An aggregate agent (unspecified in code) that ensures message order integrity.

The overall structure allows for parallel processing by dividing the workload among available cores and managing the flow of processed chunks. 
??x
```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class CompressAndEncrypt
{
    public async Task CompressAndEncrypt(Stream streamSource, Stream streamDestination,
        long chunkSize = 1048576, CancellationTokenSource cts = null)
    {
        // Setup options for the TransformBlocks to run in parallel.
        var compressorOptions = new ExecutionDataflowBlockOptions
        {
            MaxDegreeOfParallelism = Environment.ProcessorCount,
            BoundedCapacity = 20,
            CancellationToken = cts?.Token
        };

        // Define a buffer block to manage input data.
        var inputBuffer = new BufferBlock<CompressingDetails>(new DataflowBlockOptions
        {
            CancellationToken = cts?.Token,
            BoundedCapacity = 20
        });

        // Compressor TransformBlock that processes the data in parallel.
        var compressor = new TransformBlock<CompressingDetails, CompressedDetails>(
            async details =>
            {
                var compressedData = await IOUtils.Compress(details.Bytes);
                return details.ToCompressedDetails(compressedData);
            }, 
            compressorOptions);

        // Encryptor TransformBlock that processes the data in parallel.
        var encryptor = new TransformBlock<CompressedDetails, EncryptDetails>(
            async details =>
            {
                byte[] data = IOUtils.CombineByteArrays(details.CompressedDataSize, details.ChunkSize, details.Bytes);
                var encryptedData = await IOUtils.Encrypt(data);
                return details.ToEncryptDetails(encryptedData);
            }, 
            compressorOptions);

        // Connect the blocks to form a pipeline.
        inputBuffer.LinkTo(compressor);
        compressor.LinkTo(encryptor);

        // Read from source and write to destination, feeding data into the buffer block.
        using (var reader = new StreamReader(streamSource))
        using (var writer = new StreamWriter(streamDestination))
        {
            string line;
            while ((line = await reader.ReadLineAsync()) != null)
            {
                // Process each chunk of data.
                var details = new CompressingDetails
                {
                    Bytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(line),
                    ChunkSize = (long)line.Length,
                    CompressedDataSize = 0L
                };
                inputBuffer.Post(details);
            }

            // Complete the blocks to signal end-of-stream.
            inputBuffer.Complete();
        }

        await encryptor.Completion;
    }
}
```

This code sets up a pipeline where data chunks are processed in parallel, ensuring efficiency and order integrity.

#### Order of Compression and Encryption
Background context: This section explains why the order of compression and encryption is important. The text describes how these operations interact with each other to produce optimal results.

:p Why does the order of compression and encryption matter?
??x
The order of compression and encryption matters because:
- **Compression**: Works best when there are repeated patterns in data, reducing redundancy.
- **Encryption**: Turns input data into high-entropy (random) data, making it harder to identify common patterns.

If you encrypt first:
- The encrypted data is already random and has no patterns that can be compressed efficiently.
- Compression will have little effect on the size of the encrypted data.

If you compress first:
- Compression can reduce the data size by identifying repeated patterns.
- Encrypting smaller, more uniform data results in better encryption performance due to less data being processed.

Therefore, applying compression before encryption optimizes both operations. 
??x
```csharp
// Example method for sequential processing (for demonstration)
public void SequentialCompressionAndEncryption(Stream streamSource, Stream streamDestination,
    long chunkSize = 1048576, CancellationTokenSource cts = null)
{
    using var reader = new StreamReader(streamSource);
    using var writer = new StreamWriter(streamDestination);

    string line;
    while ((line = reader.ReadLine()) != null)
    {
        // Compress the data
        byte[] compressedData = IOUtils.Compress(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(line));

        // Encrypt the compressed data
        byte[] encryptedData = IOUtils.Encrypt(compressedData);
        
        writer.Write(encryptedData);
    }
}
```

This sequential approach shows that compressing first then encrypting can lead to smaller and more efficiently encrypted files. 
x??

#### Parallel Processing with Dataflow Blocks
Background context: This section explains how the Dataflow Block pattern (TDF) is used for parallel processing of data in a stream.

:p How does the Dataflow Block pattern facilitate parallel processing?
??x
The Dataflow Block pattern, specifically using `TransformBlock` and `BufferBlock`, facilitates parallel processing by:
- **BufferBlock**: Manages intermediate results and ensures that there are no more than 20 concurrent messages at any time.
- **TransformBlock**: Processes data in parallel. Each block can run multiple tasks simultaneously based on the number of available cores (`MaxDegreeOfParallelism = Environment.ProcessorCount`).

The `CompressAndEncrypt` method sets up a pipeline where:
1. Input data is buffered and processed by compression.
2. Compressed data is then processed by encryption.

This setup allows for efficient parallel processing, reducing overall execution time on multi-core systems while maintaining the order of messages through the aggregate agent (unspecified in the given code).

Using `BufferBlock` helps manage memory usage efficiently by limiting the number of in-flight operations and avoiding excessive memory consumption.
??x
```csharp
// Example setup for a BufferBlock and TransformBlock
public void SetupDataflowPipeline()
{
    var bufferOptions = new DataflowBlockOptions { BoundedCapacity = 20 };
    var transformOptions = new ExecutionDataflowBlockOptions
    {
        MaxDegreeOfParallelism = Environment.ProcessorCount,
        BoundedCapacity = 20,
        CancellationToken = cts.Token // Assuming cts is a CancellationTokenSource provided elsewhere.
    };

    var bufferBlock = new BufferBlock<CompressingDetails>(bufferOptions);
    var transformBlock1 = new TransformBlock<CompressingDetails, CompressedDetails>(
        async details =>
        {
            // Asynchronous compression logic
        }, 
        transformOptions);

    // Additional setup for the next block in the pipeline.
}
```

This example demonstrates setting up a basic Dataflow pipeline using `BufferBlock` and `TransformBlock`. The buffer limits the number of concurrent operations, while the transform blocks ensure parallel processing.

#### Parallel Workflow for Compression and Encryption
The provided code implements a parallel workflow to compress and encrypt large streams using TPL Dataflow. This approach allows for efficient processing by breaking down the input stream into chunks, which are then processed asynchronously.

:p What is the main purpose of the `CompressAndEncrypt` function?
??x
The main purpose of the `CompressAndEncrypt` function is to compress and encrypt a large data stream in parallel, using TPL Dataflow. It processes the data in chunks, ensuring efficient use of system resources by leveraging multiple processors.

```csharp
async Task CompressAndEncrypt(
    Stream streamSource, 
    Stream streamDestination,
    long chunkSize = 1048576, 
    CancellationTokenSource cts = null)
```

#### Asynchronous Compression Process
The `compressor` block asynchronously compresses the data using a provided method. It processes each chunk of bytes read from the source stream and returns compressed data.

:p What does the compressor block do?
??x
The compressor block asynchronously compresses the input data chunks using an external compression method (`IOUtils.Compress`). After processing, it converts the result into a `CompressedDetails` object for further handling in the next block.

```csharp
var compressor = new TransformBlock<CompressingDetails, CompressedDetails>(
    async details => {
        var compressedData = await IOUtils.Compress(details.Bytes);
        return details.ToCompressedDetails(compressedData);
    }, 
    compressorOptions);
```

#### Linking Blocks to Form the Workflow
The code links the blocks together using `LinkTo` methods with appropriate options. This ensures that data flows correctly between the buffer and transform blocks.

:p How are the blocks linked in the workflow?
??x
Blocks are linked using the `LinkTo` method, ensuring data flows from one block to another while maintaining the correct flow direction and completion handling. The `linkOptions` parameter is used to specify properties like propagation of completion across the blocks.

```csharp
inputBuffer.LinkTo(compressor, linkOptions);
compressor.LinkTo(encryptor, linkOptions);
encryptor.LinkTo(writer, linkOptions);
```

#### Asynchronous Data Persistence and Transmission
Background context: This concept deals with persisting data asynchronously, which can be extended to sending data across a network. The process involves reading chunks of data from a source stream and processing them before sending or storing.
:p What is the primary method for handling data persistence in an asynchronous manner?
??x
The primary method involves using ActionBlock for reading chunks of data and processing them asynchronously. This allows for efficient handling of large files by breaking down the task into smaller, manageable pieces.
```csharp
ActionBlock<CompressingDetails> buffer = new ActionBlock<CompressingDetails>(async compressingDetails =>
{
    // Process each chunk of data here
});
```

#### BufferBlock for Managing Backpressure
Background context: When dealing with large or continuous data streams, backpressure can become a significant issue. A BufferBlock helps manage this by setting a bounded capacity that limits internal buffering.
:p What is the role of the BufferBlock in managing backpressure?
??x
The BufferBlock acts as a buffer to manage the flow of data between blocks. By limiting its BoundedCapacity, it ensures that the system does not overwhelm itself with too much data at once.

```csharp
BufferBlock<CompressingDetails> buffer = new BufferBlock<CompressingDetails>(new DataflowBlockOptions { BoundedCapacity = 20 });
```

#### TransformBlocks for Compression and Encryption
Background context: Transformation blocks are used to apply compression and encryption transformations on the chunks of data. These ensure that each step in the process enriches the message with necessary data.
:p How do transformation blocks handle compression and encryption?
??x
Transformation blocks like `compressor` and `encryptor` apply specific operations (compression or encryption) to each chunk of data and enrich the messages with relevant information.

```csharp
TransformBlock<CompressingDetails, CompressedDetails> compressor = new TransformBlock<CompressingDetails, CompressedDetails>(async details =>
{
    // Compression logic here
});

TransformBlock<CompressedDetails, EncryptedData> encryptor = new TransformBlock<CompressedDetails, EncryptedData>(async compressedDetails =>
{
    // Encryption logic here
});
```
