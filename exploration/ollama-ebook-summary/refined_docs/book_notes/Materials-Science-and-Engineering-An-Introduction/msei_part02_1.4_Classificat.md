#### Why Study Materials Science and Engineering?

Background context explaining why engineers and scientists study materials. Engineers design products that are made of materials, and sometimes they need to select from thousands available based on specific criteria.

:p What is the primary reason for studying materials science and engineering?
??x
The primary reason for studying materials science and engineering is because the items engineers design are made of materials. Many engineers encounter design problems involving materials, such as selecting a transmission gear or an integrated circuit chip.

#### Ductile-to-Brittle Transition
Background context: The text explains that certain metals can undergo a ductile-to-brittle transition when cooled to relatively low temperatures. This means they can fail suddenly with little or no permanent deformation.

:p How does temperature affect the mechanical properties of some metal alloys?
??x
When some normally ductile metal alloys are cooled to relatively low temperatures, they become susceptible to brittle fracture—a phenomenon known as a ductile-to-brittle transition. At these lower temperatures, very little if any permanent deformation accompanies the fracture, and cracks can spread rapidly.

The critical factor is the temperature range through which the alloy must pass for this transition to occur. For example, a metal that is typically ductile at room temperature might become brittle when cooled below its transition temperature.

**Rating: 8/10**

#### Brittle vs. Ductile Fracture
Background context: The text contrasts brittle and ductile fractures, explaining that brittle materials fail suddenly with little or no deformation, while ductile materials deform significantly before fracturing.

:p What is the difference between brittle and ductile fracture?
??x
Brittle fractures occur very suddenly as cracks spread rapidly. In contrast, crack propagation in ductile materials is much slower, and the eventual fracture takes longer. Ductile metals fail after relatively large degrees of permanent deformation, whereas brittle materials do not experience significant deformation before fracturing.

For example, a metal that fails abruptly with little or no deformation under low temperatures would be considered brittle, while one that deforms significantly before fracturing is ductile.
