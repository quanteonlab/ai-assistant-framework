#### Error Bars and Tensile Strength Data
Background context: The text describes a method for visualizing uncertainties in tensile strength data using error bars. These bars are typically used to show the standard deviation around an average value, indicating variability. The figure provided shows how these bars are plotted above and below the data point.

:p How do error bars represent the standard deviation in tensile strength data?
??x
Error bars are graphical representations of the variability of data and are used to indicate the degree of uncertainty or error in a reported measurement. In this case, the upper bar is positioned at the average value plus one standard deviation (TS + s), while the lower bar is at the average minus one standard deviation (TS - s). This visualizes how much the tensile strength values can vary from the mean.

For example:
```plaintext
525 520 515 510
Tensile strength (MPa)
```
Here, error bars show that the data points for different samples are spread out around the average value of tensile strength.

??x
The question about this concept is how to visually represent the variability in tensile strength measurements using error bars.

#### Design Safety Factors and Structural Applications
Background context: The text discusses design safety factors, which are employed to ensure that structures can handle unanticipated failures. For critical applications like aircraft or bridge components, traditional methods of reducing stress by a safety factor may not be sufficient.

:p What is the current approach for designing critical structural applications?

#### Design Stress and Safe Stress Concepts
Background context: The text explains how design stress (𝜎d) and safe stress (𝜎w) are determined. Design stress is based on the calculated maximum load multiplied by a factor of safety, while safe stress is derived from the yield strength divided by a factor of safety.

:p How is the design stress (𝜎d) defined?
??x
Design stress (𝜎d) is defined as the calculated stress level (𝜎c) based on the estimated maximum load, multiplied by a design factor (N'). The formula for this is:
\[ \sigma_d = N' \cdot \sigma_c \]
where \( N' > 1 \). This ensures that the chosen material has a yield strength at least as high as the design stress.

??x
Safe stress (𝜎w) is calculated based on the yield strength of the material divided by a factor of safety \( N \). The formula for this is:
\[ \sigma_w = \frac{\sigma_y}{N} \]
This ensures that even if there are uncertainties in estimating the maximum applied stress, the structure can still handle it safely.

#### Factor of Safety (N) Determination for Structural Design

Factor of safety, N, is a critical component in structural design to ensure that components are not overdesigned. It helps balance material costs and weight against safety margins. The values typically range between 1.2 and 4.0, with higher values leading to increased cost but better safety.

Background context: A tensile-testing apparatus must withstand a maximum load of 220,000 N (50,000 lbf). Two cylindrical support posts are required, each supporting half the load, i.e., 110,000 N. The material used is plain-carbon (1045) steel with minimum yield and tensile strengths of 310 MPa (45,000 psi) and 565 MPa (82,000 psi), respectively.

:p What factor of safety should be chosen for the support posts?
??x
A factor of safety of \( N = 5 \) is recommended to ensure sufficient margin against failure. This value helps in calculating a working stress that balances cost and safety.

#### Safe Stress Computation

To determine the safe (or working) stress, the factor of safety (N) is applied to the yield strength (\(\sigma_y\)) of the material.

Formula: \(\sigma_w = \frac{\sigma_y}{N}\)

Where:
- \(\sigma_w\) is the working stress
- \(\sigma_y\) is the yield strength
- N is the factor of safety

:p How do you compute the safe stress for a given factor of safety and material's yield strength?
??x
The safe stress (\(\sigma_w\)) can be calculated using the formula: 
\[
\sigma_w = \frac{\sigma_y}{N}
\]
For example, with a yield strength (\(\sigma_y\)) of 310 MPa and a factor of safety (N) of 5:
\[
\sigma_w = \frac{310 \text{ MPa}}{5} = 62 \text{ MPa}
\]

#### Design Example for Support-Post Diameter

For the tensile-testing apparatus, the working stress (\(\sigma_w\)) is determined by dividing the yield strength (\(\sigma_y\)) by the factor of safety (N). The material's diameter (d) can then be calculated using the formula:
\[
d = \sqrt{\frac{4F}{\pi \sigma_w}}
\]
Where \( F \) is the applied force.

:p What is the diameter required for each support post?
??x
The diameter of each support post can be calculated as follows:

1. Given: 
   - Total load \( F_{total} = 220,000 \text{ N} \)
   - Each post supports half the load: \( F = \frac{F_{total}}{2} = 110,000 \text{ N} \)
   - Yield strength of material (\(\sigma_y\)) = 310 MPa
   - Factor of safety (N) = 5

2. Calculate working stress:
   \[
   \sigma_w = \frac{\sigma_y}{N} = \frac{310 \text{ MPa}}{5} = 62 \text{ MPa}
   \]

3. Use the formula for diameter \( d \):
   \[
   d = \sqrt{\frac{4F}{\pi \sigma_w}} = \sqrt{\frac{4 \times 110,000 \text{ N}}{\pi \times 62 \times 10^6 \text{ Pa}}} 
   \]

4. Simplify:
   \[
   d = \sqrt{\frac{440,000}{\pi \times 62 \times 10^6}} = \sqrt{\frac{440,000}{195.6 \times 10^6}} 
   \]
   \[
   d = \sqrt{0.2237} \approx 0.4728 \text{ m}
   \]

Therefore, the diameter of each support post should be approximately 47.5 mm (1.87 inches).

#### Specification for Pressurized Cylindrical Tube

For a thin-walled cylindrical tube used to transport pressurized gas, the circumferential stress (\(\sigma\)) can be calculated using:
\[
\sigma = \frac{r_i \Delta p}{t}
\]
Where \( r_i \) is the inner radius, \( \Delta p \) is the pressure difference, and \( t \) is the wall thickness.

To ensure safety, this stress should not exceed the material's yield strength divided by the factor of safety (N).

Formula: 
\[
\sigma_y = N \frac{r_i \Delta p}{t}
\]

:p Which metals and alloys are suitable for a pressurized cylindrical tube?
??x
To determine which metals and alloys are suitable, we need to ensure that their yield strength divided by the factor of safety (N) is greater than or equal to the calculated circumferential stress.

Given:
- Inner radius (\( r_i \)) = 50 mm
- Wall thickness (\( t \)) = 2 mm
- Inside pressure (\( p_{inside} \)) = 2 atm (2.027 MPa)
- Outside pressure (\( p_{outside} \)) = 0.5 atm (0.057 MPa)
- Pressure difference (\( \Delta p \)) = \( p_{inside} - p_{outside} = 2.027 \text{ MPa} - 0.057 \text{ MPa} = 1.97 \text{ MPa} \)

Calculate the required yield strength:
\[
\sigma_y = N \frac{r_i \Delta p}{t} = 4.0 \times \frac{50 \text{ mm} \times 1.97 \text{ MPa}}{2 \text{ mm}} 
\]
\[
= 4.0 \times \frac{50 \times 1.97 \times 10^6 \text{ Pa} \cdot \text{mm}}{2 \text{ mm}} = 4.0 \times 492,500 \text{ Pa} = 1.97 \times 10^6 \text{ Pa}
\]

Therefore, the yield strength of the material must be at least \( 1.97 \times 10^6 \) Pa / 4.0 = 492,500 Pa.

The given equation is used to find \(\sigma_y\) based on certain parameters, and then the alloys from Table 6.8 are evaluated based on their yield strengths.

Relevant formula: 
\[ \sigma_y = N \cdot r_i \cdot (\Delta p - \frac{t^2}{4r_i}) / (2t) \]

Where:
- \(N\): A constant factor
- \(r_i\): Inside radius of the tube
- \(\Delta p\): Pressure difference across the tube wall
- \(t\): Thickness of the tube wall

:p What is the yield strength equation used in this selection process?
??x
The yield strength (\(\sigma_y\)) is calculated using the formula:
\[ \sigma_y = N \cdot r_i \cdot (\Delta p - \frac{t^2}{4r_i}) / (2t) \]
This equation helps determine if an alloy's yield strength meets or exceeds the required value for a pressurized tube.
