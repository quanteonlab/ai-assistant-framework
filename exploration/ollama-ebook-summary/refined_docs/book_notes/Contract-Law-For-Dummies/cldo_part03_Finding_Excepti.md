#### Part Performance and Restitution
Background context: Part performance can sometimes be used as an exception to the statute of frauds if it shows that one party has relied on the agreement sufficiently. If the court finds no enforceability, restitution can be sought for the value of that part performance.

:p What happens when a court does not accept part performance as making the contract enforceable?
??x
If a court does not find the oral agreement to be enforceable due to lack of part performance or other reasons, it means the agreement was not sufficiently written. In such cases, a party can still seek restitution for the value of any part performance that occurred.

For example:
- Tom ordered materials from Dick, but did not pay.
- Harry agreed to pay for those materials, constituting part performance by his acceptance and action.
- If the court finds the agreement unenforceable because it lacks writing, Harry can still recover the value of what he paid or contributed in good faith.

This is based on the principle that a party should be able to recover the value conferred even if the contract itself cannot be enforced due to lack of written form.

#### Immutable Rules
Immutable rules cannot be changed by the parties and always apply to contracts. Examples include fundamental principles of contract law such as offer, acceptance, and consideration.

:p What are immutable rules?
??x
Immutable rules are terms that must always be part of a contract and cannot be altered by the parties involved. They encompass foundational elements like offer, acceptance, and consideration.

#### Expressio Unius Est Exclusionis Alterius
Background context explaining the concept: The Latin phrase "expressio unius est exclusio alterius" means that when a specific item is listed, it excludes other items not mentioned. This rule helps in interpreting contracts where multiple items are listed but one is excluded.
:p According to expressio unius est exclusionis, if a contract lists several items and does not include another, what can we infer about the excluded item?
??x
We can infer that the parties probably intended the excluded item to be excluded. This means that the non-inclusion of an item in the list implies it is not part of the agreement.
The reasoning behind this rule is based on the idea that listing specific items usually indicates a deliberate exclusion of others, unless there is strong evidence suggesting otherwise.
```java
// Example usage in Java code:
public boolean isExcluded(String item, String[] listedItems) {
    for (String listItem : listedItems) {
        if (item.equals(listItem)) {
            return false; // Item is not excluded as it's explicitly listed
        }
    }
    return true; // Item is inferred to be excluded as it was not in the list.
}
```

#### Looking Beyond Contract Language
Courts often go beyond the literal wording of a contract to understand the true intentions of the parties. This involves examining past experiences and practices that may not be explicitly stated in the contract.
:p How do courts examine past experiences beyond the contract language?
??x
Courts consider various factors like course of performance, course of dealing, and usage of trade to interpret ambiguous terms. These factors help clarify what the parties likely intended when they drafted the agreement.
```java
// Example scenario
class ContractAnalysis {
    public static void analyzeExperience(String experienceType) {
        if ("courseOfPerformance".equals(experienceType)) {
            System.out.println("Examining the established pattern of performance between parties.");
        } else if ("courseOfDealing".equals(experienceType)) {
            System.out.println("Considering past business practices and conduct.");
        } else if ("usageOfTrade".equals(experienceType)) {
            System.out.println("Reviewing industry-specific practices and customary meanings of terms.");
        }
    }
}
```

#### Objective Meaning from Outside the Contract

**Background Context:**
Objective meaning can be defined by reasonable people or by what parties have manifested in their communications. This objective meaning helps clarify ambiguous contract terms and can supersede other interpretations if relevant evidence is provided.

**Explanation:**
For example, if a stock trader uses coded language where "buy" means to sell and vice versa, this secret code would be considered an objective meaning that both parties have manifested through prior discussions and agreements. 

:p How does the concept of objective meaning help in resolving ambiguous contract terms?
??x
Objective meaning helps clarify ambiguities by considering reasonable definitions or meanings that are external to the contract but understood by the parties involved. For instance, if a stock trader uses "buy" to mean sell due to internal policies, this coded language is an objective meaning that can supersede any ambiguity in the written contract.
