#### Changes Made After Formation
The text mentions that forming a contract is relatively straightforward, but performing it can be more challenging, often leading to disputes over nonperformance. This section will explore whether changes made after the formation of the contract are enforceable.
:p How do post-formation changes affect contract enforcement?
??x
Post-formation changes to a contract may or may not be enforceable depending on the nature and documentation of those changes. For example, if both parties agree in writing to alter specific terms of the original contract, such changes could be enforceable under the doctrine of modification. However, without proper written agreement, changes might not be recognized as valid.
```java
public class ContractModification {
    // Code for checking if modifications are enforceable based on documentation
    public boolean isEnforceable(String modificationDetails) {
        // Check if modification details include both parties' signatures and dates
        return modificationDetails.contains("Both parties agree") && 
               modificationDetails.contains("Signed: [Date]");
    }
}
```

#### Evaluating Contract Modifications During Performance

Background context: Contracts often require future performance, and parties may need to modify these contracts due to unforeseen circumstances. The enforceability of such modifications can be complex.

:p What factors must be considered when evaluating whether a modification made during contract performance is enforceable?
??x
To determine the enforceability of a modification made during contract performance, several factors must be examined:
1. Whether consideration was required.
2. Whether the modification falls within the statute of frauds.
3. Whether the original contract has a no oral modification (NOM) clause or a unilateral modification clause.

Consideration: In theory, a contract modification is a new contract requiring offer, acceptance, and consideration. However, not all modifications require additional consideration.

UCC Article 2: If the contract falls within UCC Article 2, which covers contracts for the sale of goods, no further consideration is required for a modification. 

Common-law cases: In common-law cases, some courts still require that if there's no new consideration, the modification may not be enforceable.

Code example:
```java
public class ContractModification {
    private boolean uccApplicable;
    
    public ContractModification(boolean uccApplicable) {
        this.uccApplicable = uccApplicable;
    }
    
    public boolean isEnforceable() {
        if (uccApplicable) {
            // UCC rules apply, no further consideration needed
            return true;
        } else {
            // Common-law rule applies, need to check for consideration
            // Code here to determine the presence of consideration
            return false;  // Placeholder logic
        }
    }
}
```

#### Time-Consuming Performances and Risk Management
Background context: When one performance takes time (such as providing a service), it often needs to be completed first according to the rule of simultaneous performance. This rule is particularly challenging for service providers who need payment before their services are fully utilized.

:p How can contractors mitigate the risk associated with performing first?
??x
Contractors can use statutory lien laws and require progress payments tied to specific milestones. These measures allow contractors to secure their work and reduce financial exposure.
