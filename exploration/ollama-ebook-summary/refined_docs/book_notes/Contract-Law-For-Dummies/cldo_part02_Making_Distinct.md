**Starting Chapter:** Making Distinctions about Consideration

**Rating: 8/10**

#### Multiple Promises in Exchange
Background context: A single consideration can cover multiple promises as long as there's a clear bargain for each promise.

:p How does contract law handle situations where one party makes multiple requests, but only offers one thing in exchange?
??x
Contract law considers that if you promised to do three things and I offered $1,000 in return, it is sufficient consideration. The fact that the exchange isn't equal doesn’t matter as long as each promise has a corresponding consideration.

#### Contracts Contrary to Public Policy
Contracts that go against societal norms, moral standards, or legal policies are deemed void. These contracts cannot be enforced by the courts due to their adverse impact on public welfare and order.

:p What defines a contract contrary to public policy?
??x
A contract is considered contrary to public policy if it violates established social values, moral principles, or legal statutes. For example, agreements that encourage discrimination, harm public health, or threaten national security are not enforceable because they contravene the general welfare and interests of society.

**Rating: 8/10**

#### Mistake
Mistakes in contracts occur when one or both parties hold incorrect beliefs about a fact that is crucial to the agreement's validity. These mistakes can be mutual, where both parties are mistaken, or unilateral, where only one party holds an incorrect belief. Contracts based on such mistakes may be voidable.

:p What constitutes a mistake in contract law?
??x
A mistake in contract law refers to circumstances where there is a factual error that significantly impacts the agreement's validity. This can happen if both parties (mutual mistake) or just one party (unilateral mistake) holds an incorrect belief about a crucial fact at the time of entering into the contract.

#### Enforceability Through Conspicuousness
To ensure that unusual terms are enforceable, drafters must make them noticeable and highlight their presence. This can be achieved by:
- Using bold or large print to draw attention.
- Having the other party separately acknowledge these terms.

This practice helps prevent claims of ignorance about the contract's contents.

:p How can a drafter ensure an unusual term is enforceable in a contract?
??x
A drafter ensures an unusual term is enforceable by making it conspicuous. This involves:
1. Using bold or large print to highlight important terms.
2. Separately requiring the other party to acknowledge acceptance of these terms.

For instance, if a car rental company wants to include a substantial additional charge for taking a car to Las Vegas, they should ensure this term is clearly visible and that customers explicitly agree to it.

Example: 
```java
public class CarRentalAgreement {
    public void displayTerms() {
        System.out.println("Important Terms:");
        System.out.println("* Additional charges apply when returning the car in Las Vegas.");
        // Other terms...
    }
    
    public boolean acknowledgeTerms(String terms) {
        return "I agree to the additional terms".equals(terms);
    }
}
```
Here, the contract explicitly calls attention to an unusual term and requires explicit acknowledgment.
