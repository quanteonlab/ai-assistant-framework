#### Transparency in Data Governance
Background context discussing the importance of transparency in data governance, including what it means for organizations to be transparent about their data collection, usage, protection measures, and incident-handling strategies.

:p Why is transparency important in building a data culture?
??x
Transparency is crucial because it builds trust within the organization by making employees feel that they are part of the larger governance program. Internally, this means being open about what data is collected, how it's used, and the measures taken to protect it. It also involves openly discussing incident-handling strategies.

Externally, transparency helps build trust with customers or consumers. By clearly communicating data practices, companies can attract more trustworthy interactions and purchases.

#### Building External Trust
Background context highlighting the importance of external transparency in maintaining customer trust, especially when customers have choice.

:p Why is external transparency important for building a data culture?
??x
External transparency about data collection, handling, and protection practices is vital because it builds trust with consumers. This transparency helps in attracting more trustworthy interactions and purchases. Companies that are transparent and committed to compliance and proper data handling are more likely to be chosen over those without such commitments.

:p How does external perception affect a company's choice of customers?
??x
Customers' actions and perceptions, driven by trust, significantly impact whether they interact with a company or purchase its products. Providing full transparency about data practices externally can influence customer choices, making them more likely to choose a trusted company over one that is less transparent.
