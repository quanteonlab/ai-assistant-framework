#### Importance of Monitoring for Governance
Monitoring governance involves capturing and measuring the value generated from data governance initiatives, compliance, and exceptions to defined policies and procedures. It also enables transparency and auditability into datasets across their life cycle. This is crucial because when everything works well, efforts usually go unnoticed; however, monitoring ensures that issues are quickly identified and resolved.
:p Why is monitoring important for governance?
??x
Monitoring is essential for governance because it helps track the performance of data governance initiatives, ensuring compliance with policies and procedures. It also provides transparency and auditability, which are critical for managing datasets throughout their lifecycle. Even when everything works well, continuous monitoring ensures that any issues can be quickly identified and resolved.

#### Data Quality Monitoring

Background context: In Chapters 1, 2, and 5, we introduced data quality as a critical aspect of ensuring that organizations can trust their data for further calculations. High-quality data is essential to support business decisions. Data quality monitoring involves tracking attributes such as completeness, accuracy, duplication, and conformity.

:p What are the key attributes that should be tracked and measured in data quality monitoring?
??x
The key attributes include:
- Completeness: Identifying what data is missing or not usable.
- Accuracy: Ensuring correctness and consistency of data values.
- Duplication: Detecting repeated records to avoid redundancy issues.
- Conformity: Ensuring data is stored in a standard format.

These attributes map to specific business requirements set forth by the governance initiative. Monitoring helps create validation controls and trigger alerts when thresholds are exceeded, ensuring timely mitigation of critical issues.

#### Data Lineage Monitoring

Background context: Data lineage tracks the origin, flow, transformation, and usage of data as it moves through various stages in its lifecycle. This is crucial for ensuring data integrity, usability, and security.

:p What are some key attributes to monitor during data lineage?
??x
Key attributes include:
- Data transformations: Tracking changes and hops as data moves along the lifecycle.
- Technical metadata: Understanding more about data elements via automatic tagging based on their source.
- Data quality test results: Measuring data quality at specific points in the lifecycle.
- Reference data values: Using these to understand backward and forward lineage for root cause analysis.

Monitoring lineage helps track why a dashboard has different results than expected and aids in understanding the movement of sensitive data across the organization. It also provides an audit trail for compliance and risk management purposes.

#### Process and Tools for Monitoring Data Lineage

Background context: Monitoring lineage involves capturing data at multiple levels to understand complex transformations and dependencies. This is essential for alerting, auditing, and complying with defined rules.

:p How can monitoring lineage help in tracking the behavior of actors?
??x
Monitoring lineage helps by:
- Alerting when actor outputs are incorrect.
- Investigating inputs to determine issues.
- Augmenting or removing actors from the process flow as needed.
- Providing an audit trail for successful or attempted data breaches, helping to identify affected business areas.

Code Example:
```java
public class LineageMonitor {
    public void monitorActorOutputs(Actor actor) {
        // Logic to check if output is correct
        if (!isOutputCorrect(actor)) {
            alertUser(actor);
            updateActorBehavior(actor);
        }
    }

    private boolean isOutputCorrect(Actor actor) {
        // Check logic for correctness of outputs
        return false;
    }

    private void alertUser(Actor actor) {
        // Send alerts to relevant parties
    }

    private void updateActorBehavior(Actor actor) {
        // Update actor's behavior or remove from process flow
    }
}
```
