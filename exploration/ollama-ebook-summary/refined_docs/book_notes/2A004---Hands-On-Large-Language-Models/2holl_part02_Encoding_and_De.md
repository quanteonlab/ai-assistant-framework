#### Semantic Similarity and Embeddings
Background context explaining that embeddings allow us to measure the semantic similarity between words using distance metrics. Words with similar meanings tend to be closer in multidimensional space.

:p What is the purpose of using embeddings in natural language processing?
??x
The purpose of using embeddings in NLP is to capture the meaning of words in a numerical form, allowing for measuring their similarity and facilitating tasks like classification, clustering, and semantic search.
x??

---
#### Types of Embeddings
Explanation that different types of embeddings are used for various levels of abstraction. For example, word2vec generates word-level embeddings while Bag-of-Words creates document-level representations.

:p What distinguishes word embeddings from sentence embeddings?
??x
Word embeddings focus on representing individual words in a semantic space, whereas sentence embeddings represent the entire sentence or context.
x??

---
#### Context and Embeddings
Explanation that static word embeddings like those generated by word2vec do not account for different contexts. These embeddings should change based on the context to accurately reflect the meaning of words.

:p How does context affect word embeddings?
??x
Context significantly affects word embeddings because a single word can have multiple meanings depending on its usage in different sentences or scenarios. For example, "bank" could refer to a financial institution or the side of a river.

#### Encoding and Decoding Context with Attention
Explanation that traditional RNNs encode and decode sentences sequentially, but this process is autoregressive and not suitable for parallel training.

:p How do recurrent neural networks (RNNs) handle text encoding and decoding?
??x
RNNs handle text by processing each word in a sentence one at a time. The encoding step converts the input sequence into an embedding that captures the context, while the decoding step generates the output words based on this context. This sequential nature makes RNNs autoregressive and less suitable for parallel training.
x??

---
#### Attention Mechanism
Explanation of attention mechanisms allowing models to focus on relevant parts of a sequence, improving upon traditional RNN architectures.

:p How does the attention mechanism work in neural networks?
??x
The attention mechanism enables the model to focus on specific parts of the input sequence that are most relevant for generating the output. It selectively amplifies these signals, making it more effective in handling long sequences by focusing on important words rather than considering all words equally.
x??

---
#### Attention and Decoder Step
Explanation of how attention is applied during the decoding step to generate words based on their relevance to the context.

:p How does the decoder use attention?
??x
During the decoding step, the attention mechanism helps the model focus on relevant input words when generating each output word. Instead of passing only a single context embedding, the decoder passes the hidden states of all input words, allowing it to generate more accurate and context-aware translations.
x??

#### Example of Attention Mechanism in Translation
Explanation with an example where "I love llamas" is translated to "Ik hou van lama’s."

:p In the given translation example, what role does attention play?
??x
In this example, attention helps the model focus on "llamas" when generating "lama’s" because these words are more closely related. This focused attention improves the accuracy of the translation by considering context.

#### Attention Mechanism in Transformers
Background context explaining the concept. The attention mechanism is a fundamental part of the Transformer architecture, allowing it to focus on different positions within a sequence during both encoding and decoding processes. This differs from traditional RNNs that process one token at a time.

:p What is the main difference between the attention mechanism used in Transformers and previous methods like RNNs?
??x
The attention mechanism allows processing of an entire sequence in one go, whereas RNNs process tokens sequentially. Self-attention can attend to different positions within a single sequence, making it more powerful for tasks involving long-range dependencies.
x??

---

#### Self-Attention in Encoder Blocks
Background context explaining the concept. In the Transformer architecture, self-attention is used in encoder blocks to generate intermediate representations by attending to all parts of the input sequence at once.

:p How does self-attention work in an encoder block?
??x
Self-attention allows the model to focus on different positions within a single sequence. It can "look" both forward and backward, which is crucial for tasks requiring understanding of long-range dependencies.
x??

---

#### Encoder Block Components
Background context explaining the concept. An encoder block in the Transformer consists of two main parts: self-attention and a feedforward neural network.

:p What are the components of an encoder block?
??x
An encoder block has two main components: self-attention to generate intermediate representations, and a feedforward neural network for further processing.
x??

---

#### Decoder Attention Mechanism
Background context explaining the concept. The decoder in the Transformer architecture also uses attention but with additional layers that pay attention to the output of the encoder.

:p What additional layer does the decoder have compared to the encoder?
??x
The decoder has an additional attention layer called "encoder-decoder" attention, which allows it to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence based on the outputs generated by the encoder.
x??

---

#### Masked Self-Attention in Decoders
Background context explaining the concept. The masked self-attention mechanism in the decoder prevents the model from accessing future tokens during training, ensuring that predictions are made based only on past information.

:p What is the purpose of masking in the decoder's attention layer?
??x
Masking ensures that when generating a token at position \( t \), the model can only attend to positions earlier than \( t \). This prevents "looking into the future" and helps maintain the autoregressive nature of language generation.
x??

---

#### Autoregressive Nature of Transformers
Background context explaining the concept. The Transformer architecture remains autoregressive, meaning it needs to consume each generated word before creating a new one.

:p Why is the Transformer considered autoregressive?
??x
The Transformer processes sequences in an order where it cannot generate future tokens until it has seen and processed all previous ones. This ensures that the model can make predictions based on previously generated words.
x??

---

#### Training Parallelism in Transformers
Background context explaining the concept. One of the key advantages of the Transformer architecture is its ability to be trained in parallel, significantly speeding up the training process compared to recurrence networks.

:p What advantage does the Transformer have over traditional RNNs in terms of training?
??x
The Transformer can be trained in parallel, which greatly speeds up the training process. In contrast, RNNs are sequential and cannot take advantage of parallel processing as effectively.

#### Overview of Language Models Using Transformers
Background context explaining the concept. The Transformer architecture forms the basis for many impactful models in language AI, such as BERT and GPT-1.

:p Which models are based on the Transformer architecture?
??x
Models like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT-1 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 1) are based on the Transformer architecture.

#### BERT Overview
Background context explaining the BERT model's introduction and significance. The original Transformer model is an encoder-decoder architecture, but BERT introduces a new encoder-only architecture that can be used for various tasks such as text classification.

:p What is BERT?
??x
BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a significant advancement in the field of natural language processing introduced in 2018. Unlike the original Transformer model, which was an encoder-decoder architecture designed primarily for translation, BERT focuses on representing language using only the encoder part.

Bert's architecture includes multiple layers of self-attention mechanisms followed by feedforward neural networks. It uses a special token called [CLS] to represent the entire input sequence, which is often used as the final embedding for tasks like classification after fine-tuning.
x??

---

#### BERT Architecture
Explanation of BERT's architecture and its components. The key part of BERT involves self-attention mechanisms and feedforward neural networks in each encoder layer.

:p What does BERT's architecture look like?
??x
BERT consists of multiple (typically 12 or more) layers of encoders, where each layer includes a self-attention mechanism followed by a feedforward neural network. The input to the model includes additional tokens such as [CLS], which serve specific purposes depending on the task.

For example, in text classification tasks, the output embedding from the [CLS] token is often used for downstream tasks after fine-tuning.
x??

---

#### Masked Language Modeling
Explanation of masked language modeling and its role in training BERT. This method involves masking parts of the input so that the model can predict them.

:p How does BERT use masked language modeling?
??x
BERT uses a technique called masked language modeling during training, where it masks a part of the input sequence. The model then predicts these masked tokens based on the context provided by the unmasked tokens. This process helps in creating more accurate representations for the input text.

The masking strategy can vary; commonly used methods include random word masking and whole-word masking.

#### Pretraining and Fine-tuning
Explanation of BERT's pretraining and fine-tuning processes, highlighting the benefits of this approach.

:p How does BERT’s pretraining and fine-tuning work?
??x
BERT follows a two-step process: pretraining and fine-tuning. During pretraining, BERT is trained on large corpora (like Wikipedia) using techniques such as masked language modeling to learn general language representations. After pretraining, the model can be fine-tuned for specific tasks like text classification.

The key benefit of this approach is that most of the training is done during the pretraining phase, making fine-tuning computationally less intensive and requiring less data.
x??

---

#### [CLS] Token
Explanation of the role of the [CLS] token in BERT. The [CLS] token is used as a classification representation for the entire input sequence.

:p What is the purpose of the [CLS] token in BERT?
??x
The [CLS] token serves as a special token that represents the entire input sequence in BERT. After fine-tuning, this token's embedding is often extracted and used as an input feature vector for classification tasks. Its role is crucial because it combines information from all parts of the input text into a single dense vector.

Example: In a sentiment analysis task, the [CLS] token’s embedding can be passed through a linear classifier to predict the sentiment.

#### Transfer Learning
Explanation of transfer learning in the context of BERT. BERT is often used as a pre-trained model for various downstream tasks by fine-tuning it.

:p How does transfer learning apply to BERT?
??x
Transfer learning involves using a pre-trained model like BERT and adapting it to perform specific tasks with minimal additional training. By first pretraining BERT on large corpora, it learns general language representations that can be effectively adapted for various downstream tasks through fine-tuning.

This approach leverages the extensive knowledge gained during pretraining to achieve better performance on new tasks with less data and computational resources.
