For example, the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) includes providers like SunJCE, which implement standard encryption algorithms including AES.
```java
import javax.crypto.Cipher;
import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;

public class EncryptionExample {
    private static final String ALGORITHM = "AES";
    
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        byte[] keyBytes = new byte[16];
        // Initialize the key with your 128-bit (16 bytes) or 256-bit (32 bytes) key
        SecretKeySpec secretKey = new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, ALGORITHM);
        
        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES");
        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secretKey);
        
        byte[] encryptedData = cipher.doFinal("Sensitive data".getBytes());
        System.out.println(new String(encryptedData));
    }
}
```

??x
A single, colocated team owning a service allows for frequent, fine-grained communication and refactoring. This setup is ideal because it keeps the cost of change low, ensuring that changes can be made confidently without significant delays or coordination issues.

```java
// Example of a simple refactoring within a service by a single team
public class CatalogService {
    void updateItem() {
        ItemRepository.update(item);
        PricingService.calculateNewPrice(item);
    }

    // Refactoring to improve performance or add features
    public void optimizeUpdateProcess() {
        item = ItemRepository.getLatestVersionOfItem();
        PricingService.calculateOptimizedPrice(item);
        saveChanges(item);
    }
}
```

#### Bounded Contexts and Team Structures

Background context explaining that bounded contexts are crucial for defining service boundaries, which then influence team structures. This alignment helps teams understand domain concepts better and facilitates internal communication among services within a context.

If applicable, add code examples with explanations:
```java
public class ShoppingCartService {
    // Methods to handle add/remove from cart
}
```

:p How do bounded contexts impact the structure of development teams?
??x
Bounded contexts help define where specific domains or parts of a business logic exist. By aligning teams along these contexts, each team can focus on understanding and maintaining the domain-specific services more effectively.

In this example, if we have a `ShoppingCartService`, it is likely part of the consumer web sales bounded context. The team responsible for this service would be more familiar with its specific business logic, such as handling add and remove operations from the shopping cart.
x??

---

**Rating: 8/10**

#### Orphaned Services

Background context explaining that smaller services are simpler and may not require frequent changes. However, even services that do not change often still need to have a de facto owner.

:p How should teams handle orphaned services in microservices architecture?
??x
Even if a service like `ShoppingCartService` does not need frequent updates, it still needs an owner who can make necessary changes when required. In the context of bounded contexts, this ownership is naturally assigned based on team alignment with specific domains.

For example, if we have a team aligned with consumer web sales, they would own and manage the `ShoppingCartService`. This ensures that even dormant services are taken care of in case any updates or maintenance are needed.

REA uses a structure that allows for significant autonomy in service delivery. This includes the ability to take services down whenever needed, as long as they can satisfy batch integration with other parts of the business and stakeholders.
:p How does REA's approach enable autonomous service management?
??x
REA’s approach enables autonomous service management by allowing each line of business (LOB) significant freedom in managing its services:
- **Ability to Take Services Down**: LOBs can take their services down whenever they need, as long as the batch integration with other parts of the business and stakeholders is maintained.
- **Batch Integration**: Ensures that even if services are taken down, they can still meet the required integration requirements through asynchronous batch communication.

```java
// Pseudocode for autonomous service management
public class AutonomousServiceManagement {
    private String serviceName;
    
    public void scheduleMaintenance() {
        // Logic to take a service down for maintenance.
    }
    
    public void ensureBatchIntegration() {
        // Ensure that the service satisfies batch integration requirements.
    }
}
```
