#### Linearizability and Race Conditions

Background context: The concept of linearizability is crucial for ensuring that a system behaves as though it has only one copy of data, with all operations being atomic. This ensures consistency, particularly when dealing with multiple nodes or communication channels.

:p What is the risk when file storage service is not linearizable in a web server and image resizer setup?

??x
The risk involves race conditions where the message queue (step 3 and step 4) might be faster than internal replication inside the storage service. When the resizer fetches the image (step 5), it could see an old version or nothing, leading to inconsistent full-size and resized images in file storage.

For example:
- Suppose a new image is uploaded.
- The message queue processes this event quickly.
- Before the image storage service updates its copy, another process fetches the image from the old state of the storage.

In such cases, if the resizer processes an old version of the image, it results in inconsistent data. This inconsistency arises because there are two communication channels: file storage and message queue, without a recency guarantee provided by linearizability.

??x
The solution involves ensuring that either the write is acknowledged on both channels or implementing mechanisms to ensure one channel does not proceed before the other. However, this adds complexity.

#### Single-Leader Replication (Potentially Linearizable)

Background context: In a single-leader replication setup, writes are handled by a leader node, while followers maintain backup copies of data. Reads can be performed from the leader or synchronous followers.

:p How can reads from a leader or synchronously updated followers potentially lead to linearizability?

??x
Reads from the leader or synchronously updated followers have the potential to be linearizable because they operate on a single copy of the data, and all operations are atomic. This means that if you read from the current state of the leader, it behaves as though there is only one copy of the data.

For instance:
- If a write operation completes successfully in the leader node, subsequent reads will reflect this change immediately or after replication to followers.
```java
// Pseudocode for a single-leader system
class Leader {
    private Map<String, String> data = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();

    public void write(String key, String value) {
        // Write operation is atomic and committed in the leader node first
        data.put(key, value);
    }

    public String read(String key) {
        // Read directly from the leader node or a follower that has caught up
        return data.get(key);
    }
}
```

#### Multi-Leader Replication (Not Linearizable)

Background context: In multi-leader replication, writes can occur concurrently on multiple nodes. These writes are asynchronously replicated to other nodes, leading to potential conflicts and inconsistent data.

:p Why is multi-leader replication generally not linearizable?

??x
Multi-leader replication typically results in non-linearizability because it allows concurrent write operations across different nodes. Since these nodes do not have a single authoritative copy of the data, they can produce conflicting writes that require resolution. This lack of coordination among leaders leads to inconsistent state.

For example:
- Node A and Node B both attempt to update the same key simultaneously.
- Both updates might succeed independently without conflict detection.
```java
// Pseudocode for multi-leader replication scenario
class MultiLeader {
    private Map<String, String> data = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();

    public void write(String key, String value) {
        // Write operation is asynchronous and may not be applied immediately on all nodes
        data.put(key, value);
    }

    public String read(String key) {
        // Reads might return conflicting values if writes were not propagated correctly
        return data.get(key);
    }
}
```

#### Consensus Algorithms (Linearizable)

Background context: Some consensus algorithms can implement linearizable storage safely due to their design, which prevents split brain and stale replicas. These algorithms ensure that all nodes agree on the state of the system.

:p How do consensus algorithms like ZooKeeper and etcd provide linearizability?

??x
Consensus algorithms such as those used by ZooKeeper and etcd can provide linearizable storage because they include mechanisms to prevent split brain and stale replicas. These algorithms ensure that operations are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable (ACID properties), effectively mimicking a single-node system across multiple nodes.

For example:
- In ZooKeeper's implementation of consensus, every operation is proposed by a leader and accepted by the majority of followers.
```java
// Pseudocode for ZooKeeper consensus process
class ZKConsensus {
    private Map<String, String> data = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();

    public void write(String key, String value) {
        // Leader proposes a change, and followers agree on it
        leader.propose(key, value);
        data.put(key, value);
    }

    public String read(String key) {
        // Reads reflect the current state agreed upon by all nodes
        return data.get(key);
    }
}
```

#### Linearizability and Quorums

Background context: Even with strict quorum reads and writes in a Dynamo-style model, linearizability can still be violated due to variable network delays. The quorum conditions might not guarantee the order of operations if nodes experience different network latencies.

:p What does Figure 9-6 illustrate about linearizable executions?

??x
Figure 9-6 illustrates a scenario where a system with strict quorum reads and writes is not necessarily linearizable due to variable network delays. Even though the conditions for quorums are met (w + r > n), operations can still execute in a non-linearizable manner if requests are processed out of order.

For example:
- Node A reads from two nodes, sees the new value 1.
- Concurrently, Node B reads from different nodes and gets back old values 0.
```java
// Pseudocode for demonstrating non-linearizable behavior with quorums
class DynamoModel {
    private Map<String, String> data = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();

    public void write(String key, String value) {
        // Leader proposes a change, and followers agree on it
        leader.propose(key, value);
        data.put(key, value);
    }

    public String read(String key) {
        // Reads might return conflicting values due to variable network delays
        if (checkQuorum()) {
            return data.get(key);
        } else {
            return "Not linearizable";
        }
    }

    private boolean checkQuorum() {
        // Implementation for checking quorum conditions
        return true; // Simplified example
    }
}
```

#### Dynamo-Style Quorum Linearizability
In systems like Dynamo, which use a leaderless approach with multiple replicas, it is possible to achieve linearizability but at the cost of reduced performance. This can be done by performing read repair synchronously and ensuring that writers also read the latest state from a quorum before writing.
:p What is required for achieving linearizability in systems like Dynamo?
??x
To achieve linearizability in Dynamo-style systems, both readers and writers need to perform additional steps:
- **Readers** must perform read repair synchronously before returning results. This involves checking the consistency of data across a quorum of nodes.
- **Writers** must read the latest state from a quorum of nodes before sending their writes. This ensures that writes are based on the most recent information available.

For example, in Cassandra, synchronous read repair is applied during quorum reads:
```java
// Pseudocode for Cassandra's quorum read and write process
public class CassandraNode {
    public void performQuorumRead(String key) {
        // Read from a quorum of nodes, check consistency, then return results.
    }
    
    public void performQuorumWrite(String key, String value) {
        // Read the latest state from a quorum of nodes before writing.
        // Perform write and ensure it is consistent with the quorum.
    }
}
```

#### Riak vs. Cassandra on Linearizability
Riak does not perform synchronous read repair due to performance penalties, while Cassandra waits for read repair to complete during quorum reads but loses linearizability in scenarios of multiple concurrent writes using last-write-wins conflict resolution. This means that only linearizable read and write operations can be implemented this way; a compare-and-set operation cannot because it requires a consensus algorithm.
:p How do Riak and Cassandra handle linearizability differently?
??x
- **Riak**: Does not perform synchronous read repair, which avoids performance penalties but sacrifices linearizability in certain scenarios.
- **Cassandra**: Waits for read repair to complete during quorum reads. This ensures consistency but can lead to loss of linearizability if multiple concurrent writes occur and follow the last-write-wins policy.

For example:
```java
// Pseudocode illustrating Cassandra's approach
public class CassandraNode {
    public void performQuorumRead(String key) {
        // Perform read repair synchronously.
        // Ensure data consistency before returning results.
    }
    
    public void performWrite(String key, String value) {
        // Read the latest state from a quorum of nodes.
        // Apply write operation and ensure it is consistent with the quorum.
    }
}
```

#### Multi-Leader vs. Single-Leader Replication
Multi-leader replication allows each datacenter to continue operating normally during network interruptions, as writes are queued up and exchanged when connectivity is restored. In contrast, single-leader replication requires all read and write requests to be sent synchronously over the network to the leader in case of a network interruption between datacenters.
:p What are the differences in handling network interruptions between multi-leader and single-leader replication?
??x
- **Multi-Leader Replication**: Each datacenter can operate independently. Writes from one datacenter are asynchronously replicated to others, allowing operations to continue even if network connectivity is interrupted.

```java
// Pseudocode for Multi-Leader Replication
public class MultiLeaderDatacenter {
    public void handleWrite(String key, String value) {
        // Write locally and queue the write operation.
        // Exchange queued writes when network connection is restored.
    }
    
    public void handleRead(String key) {
        // Read from local storage or replica if available.
    }
}
```

- **Single-Leader Replication**: The leader must be in one datacenter. Reads and writes need to be directed synchronously to the leader, causing a halt in operations for followers when network connectivity is lost.

```java
// Pseudocode for Single-Leader Replication
public class SingleLeaderDatacenter {
    public void handleWrite(String key, String value) {
        // Send write request to leader.
        // Ensure leader processes and returns confirmation.
    }
    
    public void handleRead(String key) {
        // Send read request to leader.
        // Await response from leader before returning results.
    }
}
```

#### Linearizability and Network Interruptions
Background context: The provided text discusses how linearizable reads and writes can be problematic when network interruptions occur. Specifically, if an application requires linearizability, a network partition can cause some replicas to become unavailable as they cannot contact the leader or other replicas.

:p What is the issue with linearizable databases in the presence of network partitions?
??x
Network partitions can lead to unavailability for some replicas that are disconnected from others. If a replica cannot communicate with the leader or other replicas, it must wait until the network problem is resolved or return an error, making it unavailable during this time.
x??

**Rating: 8/10**

#### Multi-Leader Replication and Availability
Background context: The text explains how if an application does not require linearizability, it can be designed in a way that each replica processes requests independently even when disconnected from other replicas. This approach ensures availability in the face of network problems.

:p How can applications remain available during network partitions without sacrificing linearizability?
??x
Applications can use multi-leader replication where each replica can process requests independently. In this setup, even if a replica is disconnected from others due to a network partition, it can still handle requests locally and maintain availability.

#### The CAP Theorem
Background context: The CAP theorem discusses the trade-offs between consistency, availability, and partition tolerance in distributed systems. Eric Brewer proposed this theorem in 2000, but the concept has roots in earlier database design principles.

:p What does the CAP theorem state?
??x
The CAP theorem states that in a distributed system, you can have at most two out of the three guarantees: Consistency (C), Availability (A), and Partition Tolerance (P). You cannot simultaneously achieve all three.
x??

**Rating: 8/10**

#### Network Faults vs. Partitions
Background context: The text differentiates between network faults and partitions. Network faults are broader, including various types of failures, whereas a partition is specifically a network issue where the system can be split into multiple isolated parts.

:p How does the CAP theorem define a partition?
??x
In the context of the CAP theorem, a partition refers to a situation in a distributed system where communication between nodes is disrupted. This disruption can lead to data silos and unavailability, making it impossible for some nodes to communicate with others.
x??

**Rating: 8/10**

#### Sharding (Data Partitioning)
Background context: The text mentions sharding as a method of deliberately breaking down large datasets into smaller parts to manage them more efficiently. Sharding is distinct from network partitions in that it is a deliberate design choice.

:p What is sharding, and how does it differ from network partitions?
??x
Sharding involves dividing a large dataset into smaller chunks or shards. Each shard can be managed by a separate node, which simplifies data management and scaling. Network partitions are a type of fault where nodes become isolated due to network issues, whereas sharding is a proactive method of managing data.

#### Impact on Database Design
Background context: The CAP theorem influenced the design space for distributed databases, encouraging engineers to consider multi-leader replication and other non-linearizable models that ensure availability even during partitions.

:p How did the CAP theorem influence database design?
??x
The CAP theorem prompted database designers to explore a wider range of distributed systems that prioritize availability over linearizability in the presence of network faults. This led to the development of NoSQL databases, which often implement multi-leader replication and other strategies to ensure high availability.

**Rating: 8/10**

#### CAP Theorem Overview
Background context: The CAP theorem states that a distributed system can only provide two of the following three guarantees at most: Consistency (all nodes see the same data at the same time), Availability (every request receives a response about whether it was successful or not), and Partition Tolerance (the system continues to operate despite arbitrary message loss or failure). The theorem highlights that in partitioned networks, achieving all three guarantees simultaneously is impossible.
:p What does the CAP theorem state?
??x
The CAP theorem asserts that in distributed systems, you can achieve at most two out of the three guarantees: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance. This means when a network fault occurs, you have to choose between either ensuring consistency or availability.

#### Linearizability vs. Performance Trade-offs
Background context: Linearizability is a strong form of consistency that requires operations to appear as if they occur atomically in some total order. However, achieving linearizability comes with significant performance overhead due to the need for coordination across nodes.
:p Why do systems often not provide linearizable guarantees?
??x
Systems avoid providing linearizable guarantees primarily because it incurs high performance costs. Linearizability requires that all operations appear as if they were executed atomically and in a global order, which necessitates additional synchronization mechanisms. These mechanisms can lead to increased latency and reduced throughput.
x??

---

**Rating: 8/10**

#### Multi-core Memory Consistency Models
Background context: Modern CPUs use caches to improve performance by allowing local writes to be faster. However, this introduces inconsistencies between cores due to asynchronous memory updates. Linearizability is often impractical in such systems because of these inherent delays.
:p Why is linearizability not feasible on multi-core systems?
??x
Linearizability is not practical on multi-core systems due to the nature of modern CPUs using caches and store buffers. Writes by one core may appear out of order or not visible to other cores until synchronization mechanisms are used, which can significantly degrade performance.
x??

---

**Rating: 8/10**

#### Network Delays and Linearizability
Background context: The CAP theorem focuses on network partitions but doesn't fully address all types of network delays. Linearizable systems require responses to be immediate, which is often impractical due to variable network delays.
:p Why do linearizable systems struggle with network delays?
??x
Linearizable systems struggle with network delays because the guarantee requires that every operation appears as if it were executed atomically in a global order. This means there must be no delay between operations, but in reality, networks often have variable and unbounded delays which cannot be fully guaranteed.
x??

---

**Rating: 8/10**

#### Consistency Models and Performance Trade-offs
Background context: While linearizability is a strong guarantee of consistency, many distributed systems opt for weaker consistency models to improve performance. These models sacrifice some level of consistency to achieve lower latency.
:p Why do some distributed systems prefer weaker consistency models?
??x
Distributed systems prefer weaker consistency models because they can offer better performance by reducing the overhead associated with maintaining linearizability. Weaker models allow operations to be less strictly ordered, enabling faster response times which are crucial for latency-sensitive applications.
x??

---

**Rating: 8/10**

#### Theoretical Limits of Linearizability
Background context: Atiya and Welch’s theorem proves that achieving linearizable consistency requires a response time proportional to network delay uncertainty. This makes linearizability impractical in networks with highly variable delays.
:p According to Atiya and Welch, what is the minimum response time for linearizable reads and writes?
??x
According to Atiya and Welch's theorem, the response time for linearizable reads and writes must be at least proportional to the uncertainty of network delay. In networks with highly variable delays, this means that the response time will inevitably be high.

**Rating: 8/10**

#### Avoiding Linearizability Without Sacrificing Correctness
Background context: Even though linearizability is theoretically important, many systems choose to avoid it for performance reasons. This doesn't mean correctness is compromised; alternative approaches can maintain consistency guarantees without the overhead of linearizability.
:p How can distributed systems achieve high availability and partition tolerance while avoiding linearizability?
??x
Distributed systems can achieve high availability and partition tolerance by using weaker consistency models that still ensure correctness but with lower performance overhead. This involves designing algorithms where operations appear to be executed in some order, but not necessarily the strict global order required for linearizability.

#### Ordering and Causality
Ordering is a fundamental concept that helps preserve causality, which means that events should occur in a way that aligns with our understanding of cause and effect. In distributed systems, ensuring correct ordering can prevent confusion and ensure data consistency.

Causality violations can occur when operations appear to happen out of the intended sequence. For example, an answer appearing before its corresponding question or updates happening on non-existent rows due to network delays.

:p What is causality in the context of distributed systems?
??x
Causality refers to the logical relationship where one event must precede another for it to be meaningful or accurate. In a system, this means that operations should respect temporal order and not violate our intuitive understanding of how events should occur based on cause and effect relationships.

For instance, in an ordered system, if a user asks a question, their action (requesting the question) must come before receiving an answer. Violating this principle can lead to confusion or incorrect operation outcomes.

**Rating: 8/10**

#### Linearizability
Linearizable operations behave as if they are executed atomically at some point in time. This means that every read or write operation appears to happen instantaneously, and there is a well-defined order in which these operations take place.

The definition of linearizability implies that the sequence of events can be represented by a total order over all operations. In practice, this helps ensure that distributed systems behave predictably and consistently as if they were single-threaded.

:p What does it mean for an operation to be linearizable?
??x
Linearizability means that each operation appears to execute atomically at some point in time, which is often referred to as a *timestamp*. The sequence of these operations can then be represented by a total order. This ensures that the system's behavior can be traced back to a single-threaded execution, making it easier to reason about its correctness.

For example:
```java
// Pseudocode for linearizable operation
class Register {
    // Store the current value
    private volatile int value;

    public void read() {
        int val = value;  // Simulate atomic read
        return val;
    }

    public void write(int newValue) {
        value = newValue;  // Simulate atomic write
    }
}
```

#### Handling Write Conflicts
In systems with multiple leaders, conflicts can arise if operations are not properly ordered. The leader is responsible for determining the order of writes in the replication log to prevent such conflicts.

If there is no single leader, concurrent operations might lead to conflicts where one write overwrites another, potentially leading to data loss or inconsistencies.

:p How do you handle write conflicts in a distributed system?
??x
Handling write conflicts typically involves ensuring that all writes are ordered and applied in the correct sequence. One approach is to use a single leader who decides the order of operations. Another method includes timestamp-based ordering where each operation is tagged with a unique timestamp, and then operations are processed based on their timestamps.

For example:
```java
// Pseudocode for handling write conflicts using timestamps
class Leader {
    private Map<String, Long> timestampMap = new HashMap<>();

    public void applyWrite(String key, String value) {
        long currentTimestamp = System.currentTimeMillis();
        timestampMap.put(key, currentTimestamp);

        // Apply the operation to all followers in order of their timestamps
        for (String followerKey : timestampMap.keySet()) {
            if (followerKey.startsWith("Follower")) {  // Simulate applying to followers
                applyToFollower(followerKey, key, value);
            }
        }
    }

    private void applyToFollower(String follower, String key, String value) {
        System.out.println("Applying " + key + " to " + follower);
    }
}
```

#### Snapshot Consistency and Causality
Background context explaining how snapshot isolation ensures that a transaction reads from a consistent point in time. This consistency is defined by causality, meaning any data read must reflect all operations that happened causally before the snapshot.
:p What does "consistent" mean in the context of snapshot isolation?
??x
In the context of snapshot isolation, "consistent" means that what a transaction reads must be consistent with causality. Specifically, if the snapshot contains an answer (data), it must also contain the question (operation) that led to that answer. Observing the entire database at a single point in time ensures this consistency because all effects of operations before that point are visible, but none from after.

#### Read Skew and Causality Violation
Explanation about read skew or non-repeatable reads where data is read in an inconsistent state violating causality. A scenario involves reading the database at a single point in time which may show stale data due to concurrent operations.
:p What is a read skew (non-repeatable read) in terms of causality?
??x
Read skew, also known as non-repeatable reads, occurs when a transaction reads data that violates causality. This means that reading the database at one point in time might show stale or inconsistent data because it does not account for operations that happened after the snapshot but before the read.
??x

**Rating: 8/10**

#### Write Skew and Causal Dependencies
Explanation about write skew between transactions, particularly how actions like Alice going off call depend on observations (like who is currently on call) to establish causal dependencies. Serializable Snapshot Isolation detects such write skews by tracking these dependencies.
:p What does write skew involve in the context of causality?
??x
Write skew involves situations where the outcome of one transaction depends on the state of another transaction that has not yet committed or been observed. For example, Alice going off call is causally dependent on observing who is currently on call. Serializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI) detects such write skews by tracking and ensuring causal dependencies between transactions.

**Rating: 8/10**

#### Causal Consistency in Systems
Explanation about the concept of causal consistency where a system adheres to an ordering imposed by causality, meaning cause comes before effect. This is relevant in database systems like snapshot isolation which ensure that any read reflects operations that happened before the snapshot.
:p What does it mean for a system to be causally consistent?
??x
A system is said to be causally consistent if it respects the causal ordering of events—causes must precede their effects. In the context of database systems, such as those using Snapshot Isolation (SI), this means that when a transaction reads data, it should see all operations that happened causally before the snapshot and none after. For example, in SI, if reading some piece of data, you must also be able to see any data that causally precedes it.

#### Total Order vs. Causal Order
Explanation about why mathematical sets are not totally ordered but causal order is a partial ordering where elements can't always be compared directly due to the lack of a clear temporal or causal relationship between them.
:p What distinguishes causal order from a total order?
??x
Causal order, as used in systems like snapshot isolation, does not allow direct comparison (ordering) of all elements since some events might not have a clear temporal or causal precedence. In contrast, a total order allows any two elements to be compared, such that one is always greater than the other based on some criteria. Sets are an example where no natural ordering exists, unlike numbers which can be ordered.

#### Linearizability vs. Causality

Background context: This concept discusses the difference between linearizability and causality, two important consistency models used in distributed systems. Linearizability ensures a total order of operations, while causality allows for partial ordering where some operations can be concurrent (incomparable).

:p What is linearizability?
??x
Linearizability is a consistency model where the system behaves as if there is only one copy of the data, and every operation is atomic. This means that all operations can be totally ordered in a single timeline, with each operation appearing to happen instantaneously at some point during the execution.

Code example:
```java
public class LinearizableOperation {
    private final AtomicBoolean lock = new AtomicBoolean(false);
    
    public void performOperation() {
        while (!lock.compareAndSet(false, true)) {
            // Spin until we get the lock
        }
        try {
            // Perform the operation
        } finally {
            lock.set(false); // Release the lock after completion
        }
    }
}
```

#### Causal Consistency

Background context: Causal consistency is a weaker model than linearizability. It ensures that operations are ordered if they have a causal relationship, but operations can be concurrent (incomparable) if they do not.

:p What is causal consistency?
??x
Causal consistency means that the ordering of operations depends on their causality. If one operation causes another, it must happen before the other in any valid history. However, if two operations are concurrent and do not have a direct causal relationship, they can occur simultaneously or independently without affecting each other's order.

Code example:
```java
public class CausalOperation {
    private final Map<String, List<CausalDependency>> dependencies = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
    
    public void addDependency(String operationId1, String operationId2) {
        dependencies.computeIfAbsent(operationId1, k -> new ArrayList<>()).add(new CausalDependency(operationId2));
    }
    
    public boolean checkCausality(String operationId1, String operationId2) {
        return dependencies.get(operationId1).contains(new CausalDependency(operationId2));
    }
}

class CausalDependency {
    private final String dependentOperationId;
    
    public CausalDependency(String id) {
        this.dependentOperationId = id;
    }
}
```

#### Partial Ordering

Background context: In the context of distributed systems, partial ordering is a situation where not all operations can be totally ordered. Some operations are concurrent and cannot be compared in terms of causality.

:p What does it mean for sets to be incomparable?
??x
When two sets are incomparable, neither set contains all the elements of the other. In mathematical terms, if we have two sets A and B, neither A ⊆ B nor B ⊆ A holds true. This implies that there is no total order between them; they can exist independently without one being a subset of the other.

Code example:
```java
Set<String> setA = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList("a", "b", "c"));
Set<String> setB = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList("d", "e", "f"));

// Check for incomparability
boolean areIncomparable = !setA.containsAll(setB) && !setB.containsAll(setA);
System.out.println(areIncomparable); // true if sets are incomparable
```

**Rating: 8/10**

#### Concurrency in Distributed Systems

Background context: In distributed systems, operations can be concurrent, meaning they do not have a defined order and can occur simultaneously without affecting each other.

:p What does it mean for two operations to be concurrent?
??x
Two operations are concurrent if neither happened before the other. This means that these operations cannot be causally related; they can happen at the same time or independently of one another. In terms of partial ordering, concurrent operations do not have a defined order and thus are incomparable.

Code example:
```java
public class ConcurrentOperationExample {
    private final List<Runnable> concurrentOperations = new ArrayList<>();
    
    public void addConcurrentOperation(Runnable operation) {
        concurrentOperations.add(operation);
    }

#### Linearizability and Causality Relationship

Background context: Linearizability ensures a total order of operations, while causality allows partial ordering. Linearizability implies causality, meaning any system that is linearizable will preserve the causal relationship correctly.

:p How does linearizability imply causality?
??x
Linearizability implies causality because in a linearizable system, all operations must be totally ordered on a single timeline. This means that for any two operations, one must happen before the other, establishing a clear cause-and-effect relationship (causal dependency). If an operation A causes another operation B, then A must appear to occur before B in every valid history of the system.

Code example:
```java
public class LinearizableCausalExample {
    private final List<Operation> operations = new ArrayList<>();
    
    public void performOperation(Operation op) throws InterruptedException {
        while (!operations.add(op)) { // Spin until operation is added
            Thread.sleep(1); // Simulate waiting for the next available slot
        }
        
        // Perform the operation
        executeOperation(op);
        
        // Release the slot after completion
        operations.remove(op);
    }
    
    private void executeOperation(Operation op) {
        // Logic to execute the operation
    }
}

interface Operation {
    void perform();
}
```

#### Causal Consistency and Performance Trade-offs

Background context: While linearizability is stronger and implies causality, it can harm performance and availability in distributed systems due to its strict requirements. Causal consistency is an alternative that allows for better performance but sacrifices some of the guarantees provided by linearizability.

:p Why might a system abandon linearizability?
??x
A system may abandon linearizability to achieve better performance and availability, especially if it has significant network delays or operates in a geographically distributed environment. Linearizability requires strict ordering of operations, which can lead to higher latencies and reduced throughput due to the overhead of ensuring total order.

Code example:
```java
public class CausalConsistencyExample {
    private final Map<String, List<Operation>> causalityMap = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
    
    public void addCausality(String id1, String id2) {
        causalityMap.computeIfAbsent(id1, k -> new ArrayList<>()).add(id2);
    }
    
    public boolean checkCausalConsistency(String id1, String id2) {
        return causalityMap.get(id1).contains(id2);
    }
}
```
