#### Log-Based Approach and Database Streams
Background context: The log-based approach is a method of processing data streams that mirrors techniques used in databases, such as replication logs (Chapter 5) and log-structured storage engines (Chapter 3). This approach is particularly useful for stream processing systems that consume input streams to generate derived state or output streams. Data sources like user activity events, sensor readings, and market data feeds can be naturally represented as streams.

It is also valuable to think of database writes as a stream, using techniques like change data capture (CDC) or event sourcing to record all changes made to a database over time. Log compaction allows the stream to retain a full copy of the database's contents, facilitating powerful integration opportunities for systems such as search indexes, caches, and analytics.

:p What is log-based processing in the context of databases?
??x
Log-based processing refers to using logs (replication or change data) to represent changes made to a database over time. This method can be applied to stream processing where derived data systems are updated by consuming these logs. It allows for maintaining state as streams and replaying messages, which is essential for implementing stream joins and ensuring fault tolerance.

#### Stream Processing Applications
Background context: Stream processing involves analyzing and transforming continuous input data (streams) in real-time or near-real-time to produce useful outputs. Some common applications include complex event processing, windowed aggregations, and materialized views. Complex event processing searches for patterns within streams of events, while windowed aggregations compute summaries over time windows.

Materialized views are derived datasets that reflect the state of a database at any given point in time or over some period. These can be continually updated by consuming the log of changes from the database.

:p What are two common purposes of stream processing?
??x
Two common purposes of stream processing include:
1. Searching for event patterns (complex event processing).
2. Computing windowed aggregations (stream analytics).

These techniques help in continuously updating derived data systems like search indexes, caches, and analytics.

#### Time Reasoning in Stream Processing
Background context: In a stream processor, reasoning about time can be complex due to the difference between processing time and event timestamps. The issue of straggler events—data that arrives after a window is considered complete—also poses challenges. Understanding these aspects is crucial for correctly implementing stream processing logic.

:p What are the two types of times in stream processing?
??x
In stream processing, there are two key types of times to consider:
1. Processing time: The actual time when an event is processed.
2. Event timestamp: The time associated with the event itself, as recorded by the source.

Processing time can differ from event timestamps due to delays in data arrival and processing. Handling straggler events requires special attention to ensure correct windowing logic.

??x
---

---
#### Types of Joins in Stream Processing
Background context: There are three types of joins that may appear in stream processing:
1. **Stream-stream join**: Both input streams consist of activity events, with the join operator searching for related events within a specified time window.
2. **Stream-table join**: One stream consists of activity events, and the other is a database changelog. The join enriches each activity event by querying the database.
3. **Table-table join**: Both inputs are database change logs. This join produces changes to a materialized view based on joining states from both sides.

:p What is a stream-stream join in stream processing?
??x
A stream-stream join involves two input streams, each consisting of activity events. The join operator searches for related events that occur within some window of time. For example, it might match actions taken by the same user within 30 minutes of each other.

```java
// Pseudocode for a simple stream-stream join
public void processStreams(Stream<Event> stream1, Stream<Event> stream2) {
    stream1.join(stream2)
           .where((event1, event2) -> event1.getUserId().equals(event2.getUserId())
                                   && withinTimeWindow(event1.getTime(), event2.getTime()))
           .forEach((eventPair) -> // Process the related events
                       System.out.println("Related events: " + eventPair));
}
```

#### Experience-Based Statements About Software Technologies
Experience-based statements often reflect the speaker's specific circumstances rather than a universal truth. The diversity of use cases and requirements can vary widely across different organizations or projects.

:p Why are experience-based statements about software technologies problematic?
??x
Experience-based statements often reflect the speaker's specific circumstances rather than a universal truth, and the range of data needs is vast. One person might consider a feature unnecessary due to their specific project requirements, while another could find it crucial.

---
#### Data Integration and Dataflows
When dealing with multiple storage systems that need to maintain copies of the same data for different access patterns, clear definitions of inputs and outputs are essential.

:p What is important when maintaining data across multiple storage systems?
??x
It is critical to define where data is written first and which representations are derived from which sources. For instance, changes made to a system of record database can be captured via change data capture (CDC) and then applied to a search index in the same order.
```
// Pseudocode for CDC example
function applyChangesToIndex(changes) {
    // Apply changes to the search index in the same order they were received from the database
    changes.forEach(change => {
        updateSearchIndex(change);
    });
}
```
x??

---
#### Writing Data in a Single Order
When writing data, maintaining a single order of writes is crucial for consistency across different storage systems.

:p How can you ensure that all writes are processed in the same order?
??x
By funneling all user input through a single system that decides on an ordering for all writes. This approach aligns with state machine replication (SMR), where changes are applied to multiple systems in a consistent order.
```
// Pseudocode for SMR
function processWrites(writes) {
    // Apply each write to the database and then to the search index in the same order
    writes.forEach(write => {
        applyToDatabase(write);
        applyToSearchIndex(write);
    });
}
```
x??

---
#### Change Data Capture (CDC)
Change data capture ensures that changes made to a system of record are propagated to other systems, maintaining consistency.

:p What is change data capture (CDC) and why is it important?
??x
Change data capture (CDC) involves capturing changes made to a database and applying them in the same order to another system, such as a search index. This ensures that both systems remain consistent with each other.
```
// Pseudocode for CDC
function changeDataCapture(changes) {
    // Capture changes from the database
    let capturedChanges = captureDatabaseChanges();
    
    // Apply these changes to the search index in the same order they were received
    applyToSearchIndex(capturedChanges);
}
```

#### Derived Data Systems vs. Distributed Transactions
Derived data systems and distributed transactions serve a similar purpose but differ in their approach.

:p How do derived data systems compare to distributed transactions?
??x
Both derived data systems and distributed transactions aim to maintain consistency across multiple data systems, but they achieve this through different methods. Derived data systems typically use event logs or change data capture, while distributed transactions rely on atomic commit protocols like two-phase commit (2PC).

Using an event log can make updates deterministic and idempotent, simplifying fault recovery.
```
// Pseudocode for Event Log
function updateDerivedData(eventLog) {
    // Process events in the same order they were received
    eventLog.forEach(event => {
        applyEventToDerivedSystem(event);
    });
}
```

#### Distributed Transactions vs. Log-Based Systems

Background context: The provided text discusses the differences between distributed transactions and log-based systems, focusing on how they handle ordering of writes, atomic commit, linearizability, fault tolerance, and performance.

:p What are the main differences between distributed transactions and log-based systems in terms of handling ordered writes?
??x
Distributed transactions use locks for mutual exclusion to decide on an ordering of writes through two-phase locking (2PL), whereas log-based systems like CDC and event sourcing rely on a log for ordering events. Distributed transactions ensure changes take effect exactly once via atomic commit, while log-based systems often use deterministic retry and idempotence.

In distributed transactions, linearizability is provided, ensuring useful guarantees such as reading your own writes. Log-based systems typically offer weaker consistency guarantees because derived data can be updated asynchronously.

Code examples are not directly relevant here, but for illustration:
```java
// Example of a simple two-phase locking protocol in pseudocode
public class Transaction {
    void begin() { // Acquire locks }
    void commit() { // Release locks and commit changes }
}
```

#### Total Order Broadcast

Background context: The text explains the challenges of constructing a totally ordered event log, particularly when scaling systems to handle larger workloads. It discusses issues related to single-leader replication, multi-leader replication in geographically distributed datacenters, microservices architectures, and client-side state updates.

:p What are some scenarios where total order broadcast (TOTOB) becomes challenging?
??x
Total order broadcast (TOTOB), which is equivalent to consensus, faces challenges as systems scale:
1. **Single-Leader Replication**: If the throughput of events exceeds a single machine's capacity, partitioning across multiple machines leads to ambiguous event ordering between partitions.
2. **Multi-Leader Replication**: Across geographically distributed datacenters, separate leaders in each center reduce network delays but lead to undefined orderings for events originating from different centers.
3. **Microservices Architecture**: When services have independent durable states and no shared state, concurrent events from different services lack a defined order.
4. **Client-Side State Updates**: Applications with immediate client-side updates that continue working offline can result in clients and servers seeing events in different orders.

x??

---

#### Causality and Ordering Events

Background context: The text mentions that when there is no causal link between events, the absence of a total order does not pose significant issues. It explains how multiple updates to the same object can be ordered by routing all updates to the same log.

:p How do systems handle events without a causal relationship?
??x
When events are causally independent (i.e., there is no direct cause-effect relationship), their ordering can be arbitrary, which poses fewer challenges. For example:
- **Multiple Updates**: If multiple updates affect the same object, they can be ordered by routing all updates for a specific object ID to the same log.

This approach leverages the fact that causally independent events do not need strict ordering and can be processed in any order without impacting the outcome.

**Rating: 8/10**

#### Logical Timestamps for Causal Dependencies
Background context explaining how logical timestamps can provide a total ordering of events without requiring coordination. This is particularly useful when capturing causal dependencies between events that may be processed out of order.

:p What are logical timestamps and how do they help in maintaining causal dependencies?
??x
Logical timestamps provide a way to ensure that events are ordered according to their causality, even if they are delivered or processed out of the original chronological sequence. This is particularly useful in distributed systems where strict total order broadcast might not be feasible.

The basic idea is to assign a timestamp to each event based on some logical criteria rather than relying on wall-clock time, which can introduce inconsistencies and overhead due to clock skew across different nodes.

For example, consider an event `E1` that triggers another event `E2`. If we use logical timestamps, we might assign `E1` the timestamp 1 and `E2` the timestamp 2. This ensures that when both events are processed, they will be processed in the order of their causality.

However, this approach still requires recipients to handle events that arrive out of order, and it necessitates passing additional metadata (the timestamps) around with each event.
```java
public class LogicalTimestamp {
    private static long nextLogicalTime = 0;

    public synchronized long generate() {
        return ++nextLogicalTime;
    }
}
```

#### Event Logging for Causal Dependencies
Background context on logging events to record the state of the system before making a decision, which can help in capturing causal dependencies. Unique identifiers are assigned to these logged events.

:p How does event logging help capture causal dependencies?
??x
Event logging helps capture causal dependencies by allowing you to log an event that records the state of the system as seen by the user before they make a decision. This recorded state is then given a unique identifier, which can be used in later events to establish causality.

For instance, if a user decides to send a message after revoking their friend status, logging the "unfriend" event and assigning it a unique identifier allows the system to track that the message should not be visible to the ex-partner because of this causal relationship. Later, when processing the message-send event, the system can check against the logged state to ensure that the notification is only sent to appropriate users.

This approach helps in maintaining derived state correctly without forcing all events into a bottleneck of total order broadcast.
```java
public class EventLogger {
    private Map<String, Long> loggedEvents = new HashMap<>();

    public void logEvent(String eventType) {
        long timestamp = System.currentTimeMillis();
        String eventIdentifier = UUID.randomUUID().toString();
        loggedEvents.put(eventIdentifier, timestamp);
        // Store this in a persistent storage like database or file
    }

    public boolean isCausalDependency(String messageIdentifier, String friendStatusIdentifier) {
        Long messageTime = loggedEvents.get(messageIdentifier);
        Long friendTime = loggedEvents.get(friendStatusIdentifier);
        return (messageTime != null && friendTime != null && messageTime < friendTime);
    }
}
```

#### Conflict Resolution Algorithms
Background context on conflict resolution algorithms, which help in processing events that are delivered out of order. These algorithms are useful for maintaining state but do not handle external side effects such as notifications.

:p What is the role of conflict resolution algorithms in managing event causality?
??x
Conflict resolution algorithms play a crucial role in ensuring that derived states remain consistent even when events arrive out of their original chronological sequence. These algorithms help manage the processing of events by detecting and resolving conflicts, allowing systems to maintain correct state transitions.

However, these algorithms do not address external side effects like notifications sent to users based on incorrect state, as they only handle internal state consistency.

For example, in a system where two events E1 and E2 are processed out of order (E2 before E1), a conflict resolution algorithm might detect this and ensure that the state transitions correctly. But if one of these events involves sending a notification to a user based on the current state, and that state is incorrect due to the processing order, the notifications will also be incorrectly sent.

```java
public class ConflictResolver {
    public void resolveConflict(Event event1, Event event2) {
        // Logic to detect conflicts and update states
        if (event1.getTimestamp() > event2.getTimestamp()) {
            updateState(event2);
            updateState(event1); // Ensure state is consistent after events are processed in order
        } else {
            updateState(event1);
            updateState(event2);
        }
    }

    private void updateState(Event event) {
        // Update the state based on the event's requirements
    }
}
```

#### Batch and Stream Processing Differences
Background context explaining that batch and stream processing share many principles but differ primarily in how they handle unbounded vs. bounded datasets.

:p What are the key differences between batch and stream processing?
??x
Batch and stream processing both aim to consume inputs, transform data, join, filter, aggregate, train models, evaluate, and eventually write outputs. However, their main fundamental difference lies in handling unbounded and finite datasets:

- **Batch Processing:** Operates on known, finite-sized datasets that are processed in batches. The output is typically a derived dataset like search indexes, materialized views, recommendations, or aggregate metrics.

- **Stream Processing:** Handles unbounded data streams, making real-time decisions based on continuously incoming data. The processing happens as events arrive, and the output can also be dynamic and continuously updated.

For example, in batch processing, you might process a week's worth of user activity logs to generate insights. In contrast, stream processing would handle these logs as they come in, providing immediate feedback or real-time analytics without waiting for a full dataset to accumulate.

```java
public class BatchProcessor {
    public void processBatch(List<LogEvent> events) {
        // Process the batch of events and write derived datasets
    }
}

public class StreamProcessor {
    public void processStream(Stream<LogEvent> events) {
        // Process each event as it arrives and update state accordingly
    }
}
```

#### Microbatching vs. Hopping or Sliding Windows
Microbatching involves processing data in batches, whereas hopping or sliding windows involve more dynamic and potentially overlapping windowing mechanisms. Microbatching may perform poorly with these types of windows because microbatches can be batch-oriented and less flexible.
:p How does microbatching compare to hopping or sliding windows in terms of performance?
??x
Microbatching is typically designed for processing data in fixed, larger batches which might not align well with the dynamic nature of hopping or sliding windows. Hopping or sliding windows require more frequent updates and potentially overlapping intervals, leading to less efficient use of microbatches.

#### Functional Flavors in Batch Processing
Batch processing encourages deterministic functions that have no side effects other than explicit outputs and treat inputs as immutable and outputs as append-only. This functional approach enhances fault tolerance and simplifies reasoning about data flows.
:p What is the key characteristic of batch processing in terms of function design?
??x
In batch processing, deterministic functions are favored because they ensure consistent results based on input without external dependencies or side effects. For example:
```java
public int processBatch(List<Integer> inputs) {
    return inputs.stream().reduce(0, (a, b) -> a + b);
}
```
This function takes an immutable list of integers and returns their sum, adhering to functional principles.
x??

---

#### Stream Processing with Managed State
Stream processing extends batch processing by allowing managed state for fault tolerance. Operators in stream processing can maintain state across events, enabling more complex transformations while ensuring data integrity during failures.
:p How does stream processing differ from batch processing in terms of handling state?
??x
While batch processing treats inputs as immutable and outputs as append-only, stream processing manages state to handle continuous data flows. For example:
```java
public class StreamProcessor {
    private int count = 0;

    public void processEvent(String event) {
        // Process the event
        count++;
    }
}
```
This simple processor maintains a mutable counter that increments with each event, demonstrating how stream processing can manage state.

---

#### Asynchronous Indexing for Robustness
Maintaining derived data asynchronously, similar to how secondary indexes in databases are updated, enhances robustness by containing local faults. This is contrasted with distributed transactions which amplify failures across the system.
:p Why is asynchronous maintenance of derived data preferred over synchronous maintenance?
??x
Asynchronous maintenance allows local fault containment, whereas distributed transactions can spread failures throughout the system due to their strict requirements for consistency. For instance:
```java
public class AsyncIndexer {
    public void updateIndex(String event) {
        // Asynchronously update secondary index
        Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                // Update logic here
            } catch (Exception e) {
                // Handle exception locally
            }
        });
        thread.start();
    }
}
```
This example demonstrates how an asynchronous approach can isolate failures and maintain robustness.

#### Reprocessing for Application Evolution
Reprocessing data allows maintaining a system by reprocessing existing historical data to derive new views, supporting schema evolution and feature addition. This is essential for evolving systems without disrupting ongoing operations.
:p How does reprocessing support application evolution?
??x
Reprocessing enables the maintenance of systems by reprocessing old data in response to changes or additions in requirements. For example:
```java
public class Reprocessor {
    public void reprocessHistoricalData() {
        // Logic to reprocess historical data
        for (Record record : records) {
            newView = existingModel.apply(record);
            persist(newView);
        }
    }
}
```
This code iterates through historical data, applying transformations to derive new views, thereby supporting application evolution.

**Rating: 8/10**

#### Reprocessing for Dataset Restructuring
Reprocessing allows restructuring a dataset into a different model to better serve new requirements. This process is analogous to schema migrations in database systems, where existing data models are updated without causing downtime.

:p How does reprocessing enable gradual changes in datasets?
??x
Reprocessing enables gradual changes by allowing the old and new schemas to coexist temporarily as two independently derived views of the same underlying data. You can start shifting a small number of users to the new view for testing, while most users continue using the old view.

For example:
```java
public class ReprocessingExample {
    public void reprocessDataset(String oldSchema, String newSchema) {
        // Logic to create derived views from both schemas
        DerivedView oldView = new DerivedView(oldSchema);
        DerivedView newView = new DerivedView(newSchema);

        // Test the new view with a small subset of users
        shiftUsersToNewView(oldView, newView, 0.1); // 10% of users

        // Gradually increase the proportion of users using the new view
        for (int i = 0; i < 50; i++) {
            shiftUsersToNewView(oldView, newView, Math.pow(2, i) / 100);
        }

        // Eventually drop the old view if everything works as expected
        dropOldView(oldView);
    }
}
```

#### Schema Migrations in Railway History
Historically, railway systems faced challenges due to differing gauge standards (the distance between two rails), which restricted interconnectivity. After a standard was chosen, non-standard gauges needed conversion without causing extended service disruptions.

:p How did 19th-century English railways handle the transition from multiple gauges to a single standard?
??x
Railways converted tracks to dual or mixed gauge by adding an additional rail that allowed both old and new gauge trains to run temporarily. Gradual conversion was achieved over years until all non-standard trains were replaced, after which the extra rail could be removed.

For example:
```java
public class RailConversion {
    public void convertRailwayGauge(String standardGauge, String[] existingGauges) {
        // Add a third rail to accommodate dual operation
        addThirdRail();

        // Gradually shift trains from old gauges to the new standard gauge
        for (String gauge : existingGauges) {
            shiftTrainsToStandard(gauge, standardGauge);
        }

        // Remove the extra rail once all trains are converted
        removeExtraRail();
    }
}
```

#### Derived Views for Gradual Evolution
Derived views allow restructuring a dataset gradually by maintaining old and new schemas side-by-side. This approach helps in testing and validating changes before full migration.

:p How do derived views facilitate gradual evolution of datasets?
??x
Derived views enable gradual evolution by creating two versions of the schema (old and new) that share the same underlying data. Users can be incrementally directed to the new view for testing, while most continue using the old version until all are migrated.

For example:
```java
public class DerivedViews {
    public void migrateDataset(String oldSchema, String newSchema) {
        // Create derived views from both schemas
        View oldView = createDerivedView(oldSchema);
        View newView = createDerivedView(newSchema);

        // Test the new view with a small subset of users
        redirectUsersToNewView(oldView, newView, 0.1); // 10% of users

        // Gradually increase the proportion of users using the new view
        for (int i = 0; i < 50; i++) {
            redirectUsersToNewView(oldView, newView, Math.pow(2, i) / 100);
        }

        // Eventually drop the old view if everything works as expected
        dropOldView(oldView);
    }
}
```

#### The Lambda Architecture for Combining Batch and Stream Processing
The lambda architecture combines batch processing (Hadoop MapReduce) and stream processing (e.g., Apache Storm) to handle both historical data and recent updates efficiently.

:p How does the lambda architecture manage combining batch and stream processing?
??x
In the lambda approach, incoming events are recorded immutably and appended to a dataset. Stream processors quickly produce approximate updates, while batch processors later provide exact corrections. This separation ensures simplicity in batch processing but allows for faster approximations in stream processing.

For example:
```java
public class LambdaArchitecture {
    public void processEvents(String[] events) {
        // Stream processor consumes events and produces an approximate update
        StreamProcessor streamProcessor = new StreamProcessor();
        ApproximateUpdate result1 = streamProcessor.process(events);

        // Batch processor later processes the same events for exact results
        BatchProcessor batchProcessor = new BatchProcessor();
        ExactResult result2 = batchProcessor.correct(result1);
    }
}
```

#### Lambda Architecture's Challenges
Background context: The lambda architecture introduced an approach for designing data systems that combined batch and stream processing to handle both historical and real-time data. However, it has faced several practical issues due to its dual-layer design.

:p What are some of the key challenges associated with maintaining a lambda architecture?
??x
The primary challenges include:
1. Maintaining the same logic in two different frameworks (batch and stream) which adds operational complexity.
2. Merging outputs from separate batch and stream pipelines to respond to user requests, especially when computations involve complex operations or non-time-series data.
3. The high cost of reprocessing entire historical datasets frequently, leading to setting up incremental processing instead.

These issues make the lambda architecture less efficient compared to unified systems that can handle both batch and streaming in a single framework.

---
#### Unifying Batch and Stream Processing
Background context: Recent advancements aim to combine the benefits of batch and stream processing into one system. This approach minimizes the complexity introduced by maintaining two separate layers while leveraging the strengths of each layer.

:p What are the key features required for unifying batch and stream processing in a single system?
??x
The essential features include:
1. Ability to replay historical events through the same processing engine handling recent events.
2. Exactly-once semantics ensuring fault tolerance by discarding partial outputs of failed tasks.
3. Support for event time windowing, as processing time is meaningless during reprocessing.

For example, Apache Beam provides an API that can be used with engines like Apache Flink or Google Cloud Dataflow to implement such computations.

```java
// Example of using Apache Beam for unifying batch and stream processing
import org.apache.beam.sdk.Pipeline;
import org.apache.beam.sdk.options.PipelineOptionsFactory;

public class UnifiedPipeline {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Pipeline pipeline = Pipeline.create(PipelineOptionsFactory.fromArgs(args).create());
        
        // Read input from a distributed filesystem and process events
        PCollection<String> input =
            pipeline.apply("ReadFromHDFS", TextIO.read().from("path/to/hdfs/directory"));

        // Process the data (example: word count)
        PCollection<KV<String, Long>> output = 
            input.apply("CountWords", Count.PerElement());

        // Write the result to an output file
        output.apply("WriteResults", TextIO.write()
                .to("path/to/output/directory")
                .withSuffix(".txt"));

        pipeline.run().waitUntilFinish();
    }
}
```

#### Replaying Old Messages
Background context: Log-based message brokers provide the ability to replay messages, which is crucial for unifying batch and stream processing. This feature allows reprocessing historical data through the same engine used for real-time data.

:p How do log-based message brokers enable replay of old messages?
??x
Log-based message brokers, such as Kafka or Flume, store events in a log that can be replayed. For example, in Apache Kafka:

```java
// Example of replaying old messages from Kafka
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerRecord;
import org.apache.kafka.common.TopicPartition;

public class ReplayOldMessages {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create consumer with the necessary configuration
        Consumer<Long, String> consumer = new KafkaConsumer<>(properties);
        
        // Subscribe to a topic and start consuming from the earliest offset (replay)
        consumer.subscribe(Arrays.asList("topic-name"));
        consumer.seekToBeginning(consumer.assignment());
        
        while (true) {
            ConsumerRecords<Long, String> records = consumer.poll(Duration.ofMillis(100));
            
            for (ConsumerRecord<Long, String> record : records)
                System.out.printf("offset = %d, key = %s, value = %s%n", record.offset(), record.key(), record.value());
        }
    }
}

#### Exactly-Once Semantics
Background context: Ensuring exactly-once semantics is critical for maintaining the integrity of data processing. This means that even if a fault occurs during processing, the output should be as if no faults had occurred.

:p What does "exactly-once" semantics mean in the context of stream processors?
??x
Exactly-once semantics ensure that each event is processed exactly once, regardless of any failures or retries. This involves discarding partial outputs from failed tasks and re-executing them when necessary to maintain consistency.

For example, in Apache Flink:
```java
// Example ensuring exactly-once semantics in Apache Flink
import org.apache.flink.streaming.api.datastream.DataStream;
import org.apache.flink.streaming.api.environment.StreamExecutionEnvironment;

public class ExactlyOnceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        StreamExecutionEnvironment env = StreamExecutionEnvironment.getExecutionEnvironment();
        
        // Set checkpointing for exactly-once semantics
        env.enableCheckpointing(5000);
        
        DataStream<String> stream = env.readTextFile("path/to/input");
        
        stream.map(new MapFunction<String, String>() {
            @Override
            public String map(String value) throws Exception {
                // Process the event here
                return value;
            }
        })
        .print();
        
        env.execute("Exactly Once Example");
    }
}
```
