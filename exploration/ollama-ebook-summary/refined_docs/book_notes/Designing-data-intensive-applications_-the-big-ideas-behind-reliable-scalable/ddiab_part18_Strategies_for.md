#### Partitioning Secondary Indexes by Term
In a distributed database system, secondary indexes can be partitioned to improve read performance. Instead of each partition having its own local index, a global index that covers data across all partitions is often created. However, storing this global index on one node would create a bottleneck and reduce the benefits of partitioning.
:p What is the primary reason for partitioning a secondary index by term?
??x
The main reason for partitioning a secondary index by term is to improve read performance while avoiding bottlenecks that could occur if the entire index were stored on a single node. By partitioning, each term can be efficiently queried without the need to scatter gather across all partitions.

#### Global Index Partitioning Strategy
The global index for term-partitioned secondary indexes is divided into different partitions based on terms (e.g., colors starting with 'a' to 'r' in one partition and those starting with 's' to 'z' in another). This allows queries to be targeted to specific partitions rather than scanning all of them.
:p How can a global index be partitioned for term-partitioned secondary indexes?
??x
A global index for term-partitioned secondary indexes can be partitioned based on the terms that define the data. For example, colors starting with 'a' to 'r' could be in one partition and those starting with 's' to 'z' in another. This allows queries like "all red cars" to be targeted directly to the appropriate partitions without scanning all of them.

#### Partitioning by Term vs Hash
Term-partitioned indexes can be partitioned either by the term itself or using a hash of the term. Partitioning by the term is useful for range scans, while hashing provides more even distribution of load.
:p What are the two methods to partition a term-partitioned secondary index?
??x
There are two main methods to partition a term-partitioned secondary index: 
1. By the term itself, which can be useful for range scans (e.g., on numeric properties).
2. Using a hash of the term, which provides more even distribution of load.
Each method has its own advantages and use cases depending on the specific query patterns.

**Rating: 8/10**

#### Global Index Advantages
A global secondary index overcomes some limitations of local indexes by allowing efficient reads, as clients only need to request data from the partition containing the desired term. However, writes are slower and more complicated because they may affect multiple partitions.
:p What is a key advantage of using a global (term-partitioned) secondary index?
??x
A key advantage of using a global (term-partitioned) secondary index is that it can make reads more efficient. Rather than doing scatter/gather operations across all partitions, clients only need to request data from the partition containing the desired term.
x??

**Rating: 8/10**

#### Global Index Drawbacks
While global indexes provide benefits for read efficiency, they come with drawbacks, such as slower and more complicated writes because a single write operation may affect multiple partitions. Additionally, updates to the index are often asynchronous.
:p What is one of the main disadvantages of using a global (term-partitioned) secondary index?
??x
One of the main disadvantages of using a global (term-partitioned) secondary index is that writes are slower and more complicated because a single write operation may affect multiple partitions. Additionally, updates to the global index are often asynchronous, meaning changes made through a write might not immediately reflect in the index.

**Rating: 8/10**

#### Implementation Considerations
Implementing term-partitioned secondary indexes requires careful consideration of how terms map to partitions, as well as handling distributed transactions across affected partitions for consistency. In practice, updates to these indexes can be asynchronous due to limitations in some database systems.
:p What challenges are associated with implementing a global (term-partitioned) secondary index?
??x
Challenges associated with implementing a global (term-partitioned) secondary index include:
1. Handling distributed transactions across partitions for consistency, which is not always supported by all databases.
2. Asynchronous updates to the index, where changes made through writes may not immediately reflect in the index due to propagation delays.
These challenges require careful design and consideration of the database system's capabilities.

#### Hash Mod N Partitioning Issue
Background context: When using hash partitioning, sometimes a simple approach like `hash(key) % n` (where `n` is the number of nodes) is tempting because it seems straightforward. However, this method can cause excessive data movement during rebalancing when the number of nodes changes.

:p What problem does the mod N approach have during cluster expansion or contraction?
??x
The mod N approach causes frequent reassignment of keys to different partitions as the number of nodes changes, leading to unnecessary and costly data migrations. For example, if you initially use `hash(key) % 10` with 10 nodes, a key might be on node 6. When expanding to 11 nodes, that key would need to move to node 3, and when further expanding to 12 nodes, it would move again to node 0.

To illustrate:
```java
public class HashModExample {
    public int getPartition(int hash) {
        return hash % 10; // Example with 10 nodes
    }
}
```

**Rating: 8/10**

#### Fixed Number of Partitions Strategy
Background context: To mitigate the frequent reassignment issues, a better approach is to use a fixed number of partitions that exceed the number of nodes. This ensures that when adding or removing nodes, only some partitions are reassigned.

:p How does this strategy work in practice?
??x
This strategy involves creating more partitions than there are nodes and assigning multiple partitions to each node from the start. For instance, if a cluster has 10 nodes, you might initially create 1,000 partitions with about 100 per node.

When adding or removing nodes, only some of these partitions are reassigned. Specifically:
- Adding a node: The new node takes over a few partitions from existing nodes.
- Removing a node: Partitions are reassigned back to the remaining nodes.

The key is that the number and assignment of keys to partitions remain constant; only their distribution among nodes changes. This minimizes data movement and network load during rebalancing.

```java
public class PartitionAssignment {
    private final int totalPartitions = 1000;
    private final int nodes = 10;

    public void reassignPartitions(int newNodes) {
        // Logic to evenly distribute partitions among existing and new nodes.
    }
}
```

#### Partitioning by Key Range

Background context: In databases that use key range partitioning, data is divided into partitions based on key ranges. This method ensures balanced load distribution across nodes and handles variable dataset sizes effectively.

If applicable, add code examples with explanations:
:p How does key range partitioning work in HBase?
??x
In HBase, data is partitioned into regions based on key ranges. Each region corresponds to a specific key range, and these regions are mapped to different servers (nodes) for load balancing. When the size of a region grows beyond a certain threshold, it is split into two smaller regions.

```java
// Pseudocode for region splitting in HBase
public class RegionSplitter {
    public void splitRegionIfNecessary(byte[] startKey, byte[] endKey) {
        // Check if the region should be split based on its size
        if (regionSizeIsTooLarge(startKey, endKey)) {
            // Split the region into two new regions with appropriate keys
            byte[] midPoint = calculateMidpoint(startKey, endKey);
            byte[] newStartKey = Arrays.copyOf(midPoint, midPoint.length - 1);
            byte[] newEndKey = midPoint;
            splitRegion(newStartKey, newEndKey);
        }
    }

    private boolean regionSizeIsTooLarge(byte[] startKey, byte[] endKey) {
        // Check if the size of the current region exceeds a configurable threshold
        return (endKey.length - startKey.length) > MAX_REGION_SIZE;
    }

    private byte[] calculateMidpoint(byte[] startKey, byte[] endKey) {
        // Calculate the midpoint between start and end keys for splitting
        int midPointIndex = (startKey.length + endKey.length) / 2;
        return Arrays.copyOf(startKey, midPointIndex);
    }
}
```

#### Dynamic Partitioning

Background context: Dynamic partitioning is a method used in databases like HBase and RethinkDB to adapt the number of partitions based on the total data volume. This approach ensures that overheads remain low when there is little data but scales efficiently as the dataset grows.

:p How does dynamic partitioning work in HBase?
??x
In HBase, dynamic partitioning works by splitting a large partition into two smaller partitions once it exceeds a certain size threshold. Conversely, if a partition shrinks significantly due to deletions or other operations, it can be merged with an adjacent partition.

```java
// Pseudocode for dynamic partitioning in HBase
public class DynamicPartitioner {
    public void splitPartitionIfNecessary(byte[] startKey, byte[] endKey) {
        // Check if the current partition size exceeds a configurable threshold
        if (partitionSizeIsTooLarge(startKey, endKey)) {
            // Calculate the midpoint key for splitting
            byte[] midPoint = calculateMidpoint(startKey, endKey);
            splitPartition(midPoint);
        }
    }

    private boolean partitionSizeIsTooLarge(byte[] startKey, byte[] endKey) {
        // Check if the size of the current partition exceeds a configurable threshold
        return (endKey.length - startKey.length) > MAX_PARTITION_SIZE;
    }

    private byte[] calculateMidpoint(byte[] startKey, byte[] endKey) {
        // Calculate the midpoint between start and end keys for splitting
        int midPointIndex = (startKey.length + endKey.length) / 2;
        return Arrays.copyOf(startKey, midPointIndex);
    }
}
```

#### Pre-splitting

Background context: Pre-splitting is a technique used in databases that support dynamic partitioning. It involves setting up an initial set of partitions before the database starts receiving any data. This helps to avoid a situation where all writes initially have to be processed by one node.

:p What is pre-splitting, and why is it necessary?
??x
Pre-splitting is a technique used in databases like HBase and MongoDB to initialize an appropriate number of partitions based on expected key ranges before the database starts receiving any data. This avoids bottlenecks where all writes initially have to be processed by one node.

For example, if you know that your keys will range from 0 to 1 billion, you might pre-split into 10 initial partitions:

```java
// Pseudocode for pre-splitting in HBase
public class PreSplitter {
    public void initializePartitions(int numInitialPartitions) {
        byte[][] splitPoints = new byte[numInitialPartitions - 1][];
        int keyRangePerPartition = (int) Math.ceil((double) MAX_KEY / numInitialPartitions);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < numInitialPartitions - 1; i++) {
            // Calculate the start and end keys for each partition
            byte[] startKey = calculateStartKey(i * keyRangePerPartition, (i + 1) * keyRangePerPartition - 1);
            splitPoints[i] = startKey;
        }
        
        createInitialPartitions(splitPoints);
    }

    private byte[] calculateStartKey(int startValue, int endValue) {
        // Convert the numerical values to byte array keys
        return ByteBuffer.allocate(8).putLong(startValue).array();
    }
}
```

#### Rebalancing Partitions

Background context: When a partition grows too large or shrinks due to data deletions, it needs to be rebalanced across nodes. This ensures that the load is evenly distributed and prevents any single node from becoming overloaded.

:p How does HBase handle the transfer of partitions between nodes?
??x
HBase handles the transfer of partitions between nodes by using its underlying distributed filesystem (HDFS). When a partition grows too large, it is split into two smaller partitions. One of these halves can then be transferred to another node in the cluster.

```java
// Pseudocode for partition rebalancing in HBase
public class PartitionRebalancer {
    public void transferPartitionToNewNode(byte[] startKey, byte[] endKey, Node newNode) {
        // Determine which half of the split partition should be moved
        byte[] midPoint = calculateMidpoint(startKey, endKey);
        boolean moveToNewNode = (new Random().nextBoolean()) ? true : false;
        
        if (moveToNewNode) {
            // Transfer one half to the new node via HDFS
            transferHalfToHDFS(midPoint, newNode);
        }
    }

    private byte[] calculateMidpoint(byte[] startKey, byte[] endKey) {
        // Calculate the midpoint between start and end keys for splitting
        int midPointIndex = (startKey.length + endKey.length) / 2;
        return Arrays.copyOf(startKey, midPointIndex);
    }

    private void transferHalfToHDFS(byte[] midPoint, Node newNode) {
        // Transfer half of the split partition to the new node via HDFS
        // This involves copying files from old node to new node's HDFS directory
    }
}
```

#### Partitioning Strategies and Their Impact on Data Distribution

Background context: The document discusses various strategies for partitioning data in distributed databases, focusing on how these strategies impact the distribution of partitions across nodes. Different methods such as range-based, hash-based, and consistent hashing are explained.

:p How do you describe the range-based partitioning strategy?
??x
Range-based partitioning involves dividing the dataset into ranges, where each node manages a specific range. The size of each partition is proportional to the size of the dataset, making the number of partitions independent of the number of nodes.
x??

**Rating: 8/10**

#### Hash-Based Partitioning

Background context: This section discusses hash-based partitioning, which uses hashing functions to distribute data evenly across nodes.

:p What is the key characteristic of hash-based partitioning?
??x
Hash-based partitioning uses a hash function to map keys to partitions. Each node handles a subset of partitions determined by its hash range.
x??

---

**Rating: 8/10**

#### Consistent Hashing

Background context: Consistent hashing is mentioned as an approach used in Cassandra and Ketama, where the number of partitions per node is fixed.

:p Explain consistent hashing in the context of data distribution.
??x
Consistent hashing ensures that keys are evenly distributed across nodes by using a hash ring. When new nodes join or existing ones leave, only a few keys need to be moved, minimizing disruption and load imbalance.
x??

**Rating: 8/10**

#### Rebalancing Strategies

Background context: The document explains how rebalancing can be automated or manual, with fully automatic and fully manual approaches described.

:p What is the main advantage of automatic rebalancing?
??x
Automatic rebalancing automates partition redistribution without human intervention, reducing operational overhead. However, it may lead to unpredictable performance changes.

**Rating: 8/10**

#### Request Routing Mechanisms

Background context: The passage discusses different methods for routing client requests to the correct node based on partitioning and load balancing strategies.

:p How does a round-robin load balancer route requests?
??x
A round-robin load balancer routes requests by cycling through nodes in a predefined order. If any node owns the requested partition, it handles the request; otherwise, it forwards the request to another node.
x??

---

**Rating: 8/10**

#### Service Discovery

Background context: Service discovery involves dynamically determining which node or service should handle client requests as partitions are reassigned.

:p What is the purpose of service discovery in distributed systems?
??x
Service discovery ensures that clients can correctly route their requests to the appropriate nodes even when partition assignments change. This is crucial for maintaining availability and consistency.

**Rating: 8/10**

#### Using ZooKeeper for Metadata Management

Background context: The text mentions using a coordination service like ZooKeeper to manage partitioning metadata, ensuring all nodes stay up-to-date with changes.

:p What role does ZooKeeper play in managing partitions?
??x
ZooKeeper acts as a central coordination service that maintains the authoritative mapping of partitions to nodes. Nodes register themselves and subscribe to updates from ZooKeeper to ensure they have the latest routing information.

#### Partitioning Techniques Overview
Background context explaining how partitioning is used to handle large datasets. Partitioning helps distribute data and query load across multiple machines, preventing hot spots. Different NoSQL databases employ various strategies for managing partitions.

:p How do different NoSQL databases manage their partitions?
??x
Different NoSQL databases use varying methods for partition management. For example, LinkedIn's Espresso uses Helix with ZooKeeper for cluster management, while HBase and SolrCloud rely on ZooKeeper to track partition assignments. Cassandra and Riak utilize a gossip protocol among nodes to disseminate changes in the cluster state without relying on external coordination services like ZooKeeper. MongoDB employs its own config servers and mongos daemons as routing tiers.

```java
// Example of a simplified pseudocode for node-based partitioning (Cassandra-like)
public class NodeBasedPartitioner {
    public void distributePartitions(List<Node> nodes, Map<String, String> data) {
        for (String key : data.keySet()) {
            int hash = calculateHash(key);
            Node targetNode = findNodeByHash(nodes, hash);
            targetNode.storeData(key, data.get(key));
        }
    }

    private int calculateHash(String key) {
        // Simple hash function
        return Math.abs(key.hashCode() % nodes.size());
    }

    private Node findNodeByHash(List<Node> nodes, int hash) {
        for (Node node : nodes) {
            if (node.getPartitionRange().contains(hash)) {
                return node;
            }
        }
        return null; // Fallback in case of no match
    }
}
```

#### Routing Tier Overview
Background context explaining the role of a routing tier. A routing tier helps clients find the correct nodes to query, reducing dependency on external services like ZooKeeper.

:p What is the function of a routing tier?
??x
A routing tier assists in directing client requests to the appropriate nodes within a distributed system. For instance, LinkedIn's Espresso uses Helix with ZooKeeper for this purpose, while MongoDB relies on its own config servers and mongos daemons as the routing layer. This approach simplifies the design by leveraging existing components rather than introducing additional dependencies.

```java
// Example of a routing tier setup in MongoDB (simplified pseudocode)
public class RoutingTier {
    private ConfigServer configServer;
    private Mongos mongos;

    public void initializeRoutingTier() {
        configServer = new ConfigServer();
        mongos = new Mongos(configServer);
        // Additional initialization steps
    }

    public Node findNodeForKey(String key) {
        return mongos.findNodeForKey(key);
    }
}
```

#### Gossip Protocol for Partitioning
Background context explaining the gossip protocol used by Cassandra and Riak. This protocol allows nodes to share information about changes in their state.

:p How does the gossip protocol work?
??x
The gossip protocol enables nodes to disseminate updates about their state to other nodes within a distributed system. In Cassandra and Riak, each node periodically sends out a "gossip" message containing its current state (e.g., online/offline status) and recent changes to other nodes. This helps all nodes maintain an up-to-date view of the cluster's topology without relying on external coordination services like ZooKeeper.

```java
// Simplified pseudocode for gossip protocol in Cassandra-like system
public class GossipProtocol {
    private List<Node> nodes;

    public void startGossip() {
        while (true) {
            for (Node node : nodes) {
                node.sendGossipMessage();
                node.receiveGossipMessagesFromNeighbors();
            }
            // Simulate time passage to allow new messages
            Thread.sleep(1000);
        }
    }

    class Node {
        private boolean onlineStatus;
        private Set<Node> neighbors;

        public void sendGossipMessage() {
            for (Node neighbor : neighbors) {
                if (!neighbor.getOnlineStatus()) { // Check before sending
                    neighbor.receiveGossipMessage(this);
                }
            }
        }

        public void receiveGossipMessagesFromNeighbors() {
            // Update state based on received messages
        }

        private boolean getOnlineStatus() {
            // Return current online status
            return onlineStatus;
        }
    }
}
```

#### Key Range Partitioning
Background context explaining key range partitioning. This approach involves dividing keys into ranges and assigning each range to a specific node.

:p What is key range partitioning?
??x
Key range partitioning is a method of distributing data across multiple nodes by sorting keys into contiguous ranges. Each partition owns all the keys from some minimum value up to a maximum value. This ensures that queries for a given key range can be directed to the appropriate node, balancing the load and avoiding hot spots.

```java
// Example implementation of key range partitioning (pseudocode)
public class KeyRangePartitioner {
    private Map<String, Node> partitionToNodeMap;

    public void initializePartitions(List<Node> nodes) {
        String startKey = "a";
        for (Node node : nodes) {
            int nodeIndex = nodes.indexOf(node);
            int rangeSize = 26 / nodes.size(); // Assuming evenly distributed keys
            String endKey = (char)(startKey.charAt(0) + rangeSize) + "";
            partitionToNodeMap.put(startKey, node);
            startKey = endKey;
        }
    }

    public Node findNodeForKey(String key) {
        if (key.length() < 1 || !partitionToNodeMap.containsKey(key)) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid key");
        }
        return partitionToNodeMap.get(key.charAt(0));
    }
}
```

#### Sorting for Partitioning

Background context: Sorting keys can be beneficial as it allows efficient range queries. However, this approach may lead to hot spots when frequently accessed keys are close together in the sorted order.

:p What is a potential drawback of using sorting for partitioning?
??x
Sorting can create hot spots because frequently accessed keys that are close together in the sorted order will be stored on the same partition, leading to uneven load distribution. This can cause performance issues as these partitions may become overloaded while others remain underutilized.
x??

**Rating: 8/10**

#### Hash Partitioning

Background context: In hash partitioning, a hash function is applied to each key to distribute keys across partitions. This method destroys the ordering of keys but provides better load balancing for range queries.

:p What is the main advantage of using hash partitioning over sorting?
??x
Hash partitioning distributes data more evenly across partitions, reducing the risk of hot spots compared to sorted partitioning. While it destroys the key order and makes range queries less efficient, it generally improves overall system performance by balancing the load better.
x??

**Rating: 8/10**

#### Dynamic Partitioning

Background context: Partitions are typically rebalanced dynamically in hash partitioning by splitting large partitions into smaller subranges when necessary.

:p How does dynamic partitioning work?
??x
Dynamic partitioning involves monitoring the size of each partition and splitting larger partitions to keep them within a predefined threshold. This helps maintain load balance across nodes as data grows or changes over time.
```java
// Pseudocode for dynamic partitioning
public class DynamicPartitioner {
    private int maxSize;

    public void rebalancePartitions(List<Partition> partitions) {
        for (Partition p : partitions) {
            if (p.getSize() > maxSize) {
                // Split the large partition into smaller subranges
                Partition newPartition = splitPartition(p);
                rebalancePartitions(newPartition.getSubranges());
            }
        }
    }

    private Partition splitPartition(Partition p) {
        // Implement logic to create two or more subranges from a single partition
        return new Partition();
    }
}
```

#### Hybrid Partitioning

Background context: Hybrid approaches combine hash and range-based partitioning. For example, using one part of the key for hash partitioning and another part for sorting.

:p How does hybrid partitioning work?
??x
Hybrid partitioning uses a compound key where one part is used to hash the keys across multiple partitions, while another part ensures that records with similar values stay together in sorted order. This approach leverages the benefits of both methods.
```java
// Pseudocode for hybrid partitioning
public class HybridPartitioner {
    private int hashCodePart;
    private int sortPart;

    public Partition getPartition(String key) {
        // Calculate hash code part and sort part from the key
        int hash = calculateHashCode(key, hashCodePart);
        String sortedKey = sortBySortPart(key, sortPart);

        // Determine partition based on the combined result
        return new Partition(hash, sortedKey);
    }

    private int calculateHashCode(String key, int part) {
        // Implement logic to extract a specific part of the key for hashing
        return 0;
    }

    private String sortBySortPart(String key, int part) {
        // Implement sorting based on the specified part of the key
        return "";
    }
}
```

#### Secondary Indexes

Background context: When using partitioning, secondary indexes must also be partitioned. This can be done in two ways: document-partitioned or term-partitioned.

:p What are the two methods for partitioning secondary indexes?
??x
The two methods for partitioning secondary indexes are:
1. **Document-partitioned indexes (local indexes)** - These store secondary index data in the same partition as the primary key and value, requiring only one partition to be updated on write but necessitating a scatter/gather operation across all partitions during read.
2. **Term-partitioned indexes (global indexes)** - These partition the secondary index using indexed values, allowing reads to be served from a single partition at write time.

```java
// Pseudocode for document-partitioned index
public class DocumentPartitionedIndex {
    public void updateEntry(String key, String value) {
        // Update only one partition since both primary and secondary keys are in the same partition
        // Logic to find the correct partition based on key
        Partition partition = findPartition(key);
        partition.updateSecondaryIndex(value);
    }

    public List<String> getValuesBySecondaryKey(String secondaryKey) {
        // Scatter/gather operation needed as all partitions may contain relevant data
        return gatherFromAllPartitions(secondaryKey);
    }
}

// Pseudocode for term-partitioned index
public class TermPartitionedIndex {
    public void updateEntry(String key, String value) {
        // Multiple partitions need to be updated since the secondary keys are partitioned
        List<Partition> relevantPartitions = findRelevantPartitions(value);
        for (Partition p : relevantPartitions) {
            p.updateSecondaryIndex(key, value);
        }
    }

    public List<String> getValuesBySecondaryKey(String secondaryKey) {

#### Query Routing

Background context: Efficient query routing to appropriate partitions involves load balancing and parallel query execution.

:p What techniques are used for routing queries in a partitioned database?
??x
Techniques for routing queries include:
- Simple partition-aware load balancing, where queries are routed based on the key's hash or other metadata.
- Sophisticated parallel query execution engines that can handle complex queries by dividing them into smaller tasks and executing them concurrently across partitions.

```java
// Pseudocode for simple partition routing
public class PartitionRouter {
    public void routeQuery(String key, Query query) {
        // Determine the target partition based on the hash of the key or other metadata
        int partitionIndex = calculatePartitionIndex(key);
        sendQueryTo(partitionIndex, query);
    }

    private int calculatePartitionIndex(String key) {
        // Implement logic to map keys to partitions
        return 0;
    }

    private void sendQueryTo(int partitionIndex, Query query) {
        // Logic to route the query to the correct partition
    }
}
```

#### Write Operations in Partitioned Databases

Background context: Write operations that need to write to multiple partitions can be challenging and require careful handling to ensure consistency.

:p What is a challenge when performing writes across multiple partitions?
??x
A significant challenge in writing to multiple partitions in a partitioned database is ensuring data consistency. For example, what happens if one partition succeeds while another fails? This can lead to partial updates or inconsistencies unless proper transaction management and error handling mechanisms are implemented.
```java
// Pseudocode for managing multi-partition writes
public class MultiPartitionWriter {
    public void writeData(String key, String value) {
        List<WriteRequest> requests = generateWriteRequests(key, value);
        boolean allSuccessful = executeWriteRequests(requests);

        if (!allSuccessful) {
            // Handle partial success or failure cases
            handlePartialSuccess(requests);
        }
    }

    private List<WriteRequest> generateWriteRequests(String key, String value) {
        // Generate write requests for each relevant partition
        return new ArrayList<>();
    }

    private boolean executeWriteRequests(List<WriteRequest> requests) {
        // Execute the write requests and check if all succeed
        return true;
    }

    private void handlePartialSuccess(List<WriteRequest> requests) {
        // Implement logic to manage partial success cases, e.g., retry or mark as failed
    }
}
```
