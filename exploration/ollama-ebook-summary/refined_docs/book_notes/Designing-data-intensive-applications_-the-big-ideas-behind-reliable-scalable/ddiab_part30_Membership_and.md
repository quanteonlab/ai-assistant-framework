#### Linearizable Atomic Operations
Background context explaining the concept. Linearizable atomic operations allow for a sequence of operations to appear as if they were executed atomically and linearly, even when distributed across different nodes. This is crucial for ensuring that the order of operations is consistent, which prevents conflicts and ensures correctness in a distributed environment.

:p What are linearizable atomic operations used for?
??x
Linearizable atomic operations are used to ensure that multiple operations on shared data appear to have been executed sequentially, as if they were performed by a single-threaded execution. This property is essential for building systems where the order of operations must be strictly enforced, such as distributed locks and leader election mechanisms.
```java
// Pseudocode for implementing an atomic compare-and-set operation in ZooKeeper
public class CompareAndSet {
    private int currentValue;
    private int expectedValue;
    private int newValue;

    public boolean compareAndSet(int expectedValue, int newValue) {
        if (this.currentValue == expectedValue) {
            this.currentValue = newValue;
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

#### Distributed Locks and Ephemeral Nodes
Background context explaining the concept. Distributed locks are used to coordinate access to shared resources in a distributed system, ensuring that only one node can modify or read certain data at any given time. Ephemeral nodes in ZooKeeper help manage these locks by automatically releasing them when a session times out.

:p How do ephemeral nodes work in ZooKeeper?
??x
Ephemeral nodes in ZooKeeper are special types of nodes that are automatically deleted when the client's session expires or times out. This mechanism helps in managing distributed locks, as any lock held by an expired session will be released, preventing deadlocks and ensuring proper resource management.

Example:
- A node registers a lock on a specific key.
- If the node's session expires (due to network issues or crashes), the ephemeral node representing the lock is automatically removed from ZooKeeper.
```java
// Pseudocode for creating an ephemeral node in ZooKeeper
public class EphemeralNode {
    public Node createEphemeral(String path, byte[] data) {
        // Code to create an ephemeral node with a session-specific identifier
        return new Node(path, data);
    }
}
```

#### Total Ordering of Operations
Background context explaining the concept. Total ordering of operations ensures that all operations are processed in a strict order, which is crucial for maintaining consistency and preventing conflicts in distributed systems. ZooKeeper achieves this by assigning each operation a unique transaction ID (zxid) that monotonically increases over time.

:p How does ZooKeeper ensure total ordering of operations?
??x
ZooKeeper ensures total ordering of operations by maintaining a strict sequence in which all operations are processed. Each operation is assigned a unique transaction ID (zxid), which is a monotonically increasing number. This zxid guarantees that the order of operations can be tracked and enforced, preventing conflicts and ensuring consistency.

Example:
- Client A performs an operation with zxid 10.
- Client B performs another operation with zxid 11.
- These operations are processed in the exact sequence they were initiated, regardless of network delays or node failures.

```java
// Pseudocode for assigning transaction IDs (zxids) in ZooKeeper
public class TransactionID {
    private int nextZxid;

    public synchronized int getNextTransactionID() {
        return ++nextZxid;
    }
}
```

#### Failure Detection and Heartbeats
Background context explaining the concept. Failure detection is a critical aspect of distributed systems, as it ensures that nodes can quickly identify when another node has failed or become unresponsive. ZooKeeper uses heartbeats to maintain long-lived sessions between clients and servers, allowing for automatic session timeouts if necessary.

:p How does ZooKeeper handle failure detection?
??x
ZooKeeper handles failure detection by maintaining a heartbeat mechanism between clients and the server nodes. Clients keep their sessions active by sending periodic heartbeats to the ZooKeeper servers. If no heartbeats are received within the configured timeout period, the session is considered dead, and any ephemeral nodes held by that client will be automatically deleted.

Example:
- Client A sends a heartbeat every 2 seconds.
- Server receives the heartbeat and updates the last seen timestamp for Client A.
- After 5 seconds of no heartbeats, the server declares the session to be dead and removes all associated ephemeral nodes.

```java
// Pseudocode for managing sessions in ZooKeeper
public class SessionManager {
    private Map<String, Long> lastSeenTimestamps;

    public void heartbeat(String sessionId) {
        lastSeenTimestamps.put(sessionId, System.currentTimeMillis());
    }

    public boolean checkSessionTimeout(String sessionId) {
        if (System.currentTimeMillis() - lastSeenTimestamps.get(sessionId) > timeout) {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

#### Change Notifications
Background context explaining the concept. Change notifications allow clients to be notified of changes in ZooKeeper data, enabling them to react to updates without constantly polling for new information. This feature is particularly useful for maintaining state consistency and providing real-time feedback.

:p How do change notifications work in ZooKeeper?
??x
Change notifications in ZooKeeper work by allowing a client to watch specific nodes or paths for modifications. When the watched node changes, ZooKeeper sends a notification to the client, informing it of the update without requiring continuous polling.

Example:
- Client A watches path /znode1.
- Node /znode1 is updated by another process.
- ZooKeeper sends a notification to Client A indicating that the data has changed.

```java
// Pseudocode for implementing change notifications in ZooKeeper
public class ChangeNotification {
    public void watchNode(String path, Watcher watcher) {
        // Code to register the client as an observer of changes on the specified path
    }

    public void onChange(Watcher.Event.KeeperEvent event) {
        if (event.getType() == Watcher.Event.KeeperEvent.EventType.NodeDataChanged) {
            System.out.println("Node data changed: " + event.getPath());
        }
    }
}
```

#### Rebalancing Partitions
Background context explaining the concept. In distributed systems, rebalancing partitions is a common task to ensure that resources are evenly distributed among nodes as new nodes join or existing nodes fail. ZooKeeper can facilitate this process by providing atomic operations and notifications for coordinated partitioning.

:p How does ZooKeeper help in rebalancing partitions?
??x
ZooKeeper helps in rebalancing partitions through the use of atomic operations, ephemeral nodes, and change notifications. By leveraging these features, applications can automatically redistribute work among nodes without manual intervention, ensuring that resources are balanced efficiently as new or failing nodes join or leave the cluster.

Example:
- Node A fails.
- ZooKeeper detects the failure and triggers a rebalancing operation.
- Other nodes take over the failed node's workload using atomic operations and notifications to coordinate the transition seamlessly.

```java
// Pseudocode for rebalancing partitions in ZooKeeper
public class PartitionRebalancer {
    public void handleNodeFailure(String failedNode) {
        // Code to notify other nodes about the failure and trigger partition redistribution
    }

    public void redistributePartitions() {
        // Use atomic operations to move data from failed node to healthy nodes
    }
}
```

#### Service Discovery
Background context explaining the concept. Service discovery is a mechanism used in distributed systems to dynamically locate services based on their names or attributes, often without knowing their actual IP addresses beforehand. While traditional DNS can be used for this purpose, consensus-based systems like ZooKeeper provide more reliable and robust solutions.

:p How does service discovery work with ZooKeeper?
??x
Service discovery with ZooKeeper works by registering the network endpoints of services as ephemeral nodes when they start up. Other services can then query ZooKeeper to find out which IP addresses correspond to specific services, making it easier to establish connections dynamically without hardcoding addresses.

Example:
- Service X starts and registers its endpoint at /serviceX.
- Another service Y queries ZooKeeper for the endpoints of service X by watching path /serviceX.

```java
// Pseudocode for service discovery in ZooKeeper
public class ServiceDiscovery {
    public void registerService(String serviceName, String ipAddress) {
        // Code to create an ephemeral node representing the service's endpoint
    }

    public List<String> discoverServices(String serviceName) {
        // Code to watch and return a list of endpoints for the specified service name
        return new ArrayList<>();
    }
}
```

#### Membership Services
Background context explaining the concept. Membership services are crucial for maintaining information about which nodes are part of a distributed system, including their current state and roles. ZooKeeper has been used extensively in this role due to its ability to manage node membership, failure detection, and coordination.

:p What is the significance of membership services in distributed systems?
??x
Membership services are significant in distributed systems because they provide critical information about which nodes are part of a cluster, their current state, and roles. This information is essential for maintaining system integrity, ensuring that only authorized nodes can participate, and facilitating failover mechanisms.

Example:
- ZooKeeper maintains a list of active members in the form of ephemeral nodes.
- When a node fails or joins, this change is tracked by ZooKeeper and used to update membership information.

```java
// Pseudocode for managing membership in ZooKeeper
public class MembershipManager {
    private Set<String> activeMembers;

    public void addMember(String nodeId) {
        // Code to add a new member to the active list of nodes
    }

    public void removeMember(String nodeId) {
        // Code to remove a failed or leaving node from the active list
    }
}
```

**Rating: 8/10**

#### Membership Service and Consensus
Background context: The membership service is crucial for determining which nodes are active members of a cluster. Due to unbounded network delays, it's challenging to reliably detect node failures. However, combining failure detection with consensus allows nodes to agree on the current state of their membership.

:p What is the purpose of coupling failure detection with consensus in a distributed system?
??x
To enable nodes to collectively decide which members are considered alive or dead, despite network delays and unreliable communication.
x??

---

**Rating: 8/10**

#### Linearizability
Background context: Linearizability is a consistency model where operations appear as if they were executed one after another on a single copy of the data. This makes replicated data seem atomic, much like a variable in a single-threaded program.

:p What is linearizability and why is it useful?
??x
Linearizability ensures that operations on replicated data are consistent and behave atomically as if there was only a single copy of the data. It simplifies understanding and debugging because it abstracts away the complexity of multiple replicas.
x??

---

**Rating: 8/10**

#### Causality
Background context: Unlike linearizability, which orders all operations in one timeline, causality allows for concurrent operations by providing an ordering based on cause and effect.

:p What does causality provide that linearizability doesn't?
??x
Causality offers a weaker consistency model where some things can be concurrent. It provides a version history like a branching timeline with merging branches, reducing coordination overhead compared to linearizability.
x??

---

**Rating: 8/10**

#### Consensus Problems
Background context: Achieving consensus is about making all nodes agree on what was decided and ensuring that decisions are irrevocable. Various problems, including ensuring unique usernames in concurrent registration scenarios, can be reduced to the problem of consensus.

:p What does achieving consensus solve in a distributed system?
??x
Achieving consensus ensures that all nodes in a distributed system agree on a decision and make it irrevocable, which is crucial for operations like leader election or ensuring uniqueness across multiple nodes.
x??

---

**Rating: 8/10**

#### Linearizable Compare-and-Set Registers
Background context: A linearizable compare-and-set (CAS) register atomically decides whether to set its value based on the current value. This operation needs to be consistent and atomic.

:p What does a linearizable compare-and-set register do?
??x
A linearizable compare-and-set register atomically checks if the current value matches a given parameter, and if so, sets it to a new value, ensuring consistency as if operating on a single copy of data.
x??

---

**Rating: 8/10**

#### Timestamp Ordering is Not Sufficient
Background context: Using timestamps alone may not suffice for certain operations, such as ensuring unique usernames during concurrent registration. The problem arises because nodes might have different views of the current state.

:p Why can't timestamp ordering alone ensure uniqueness in concurrent registrations?
??x
Timestamps do not inherently prevent concurrent modifications. If two nodes independently decide to register the same username at nearly the same time, their timestamps might be similar or identical, leading to potential conflicts without additional coordination mechanisms.
x??

--- 

#### Causality and Timestamps
Background context: While timestamps provide a basic ordering of events, causality can handle more complex scenarios where operations are concurrent but still need to respect cause and effect.

:p How does causality help in resolving concurrency issues that timestamps alone cannot?
??x
Causality provides a way to order events based on their causal relationships, allowing for concurrent operations while respecting the overall flow of events. This is useful when timestamps might not provide enough information about the sequence due to clock skew or other delays.
x??

--- 

#### Summary of Consistency Models
Background context: The text explores different consistency models like linearizability and causality, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.

:p What are some key differences between linearizable and causal consistency?
??x
Linearizability requires operations to be atomic and appear in a single, totally ordered timeline, while causality allows for concurrent operations but ensures events are ordered based on cause and effect. Linearizability is easier to understand but less flexible with network issues, whereas causality is more robust and better handles concurrency.

:p What does the messaging system need to ensure when delivering messages?
??x
The messaging system needs to ensure that messages are delivered in a specific, ordered sequence.
x??

---

**Rating: 8/10**

#### Locks and Leases
Background context: When several clients race to acquire a lock or lease, only one can succeed. The system must decide which client gets the lock.

:p How does the system determine which client successfully acquires a lock?
??x
The system decides which client is granted the lock based on predefined rules or mechanisms.
x??

---

**Rating: 8/10**

#### Membership/Coordination Service
Background context: Given failure detectors, such as timeouts, the system needs to decide which nodes are alive and which should be considered dead due to session timeouts.

:p What does the membership service need to determine?
??x
The membership service needs to identify which nodes are currently alive and which have timed out.
x??

---

**Rating: 8/10**

#### Uniqueness Constraint
Background context: Concurrent transactions may try to create records with the same key. The system must decide which transaction should succeed and which should fail due to a uniqueness constraint.

:p How does the system handle concurrent transactions trying to insert conflicting records?
??x
The system decides which transaction succeeds by ensuring no two records have the same key, enforcing constraints.
x??

**Rating: 8/10**

#### Single-Leader Database
Background context: In a single-leader database, all decision-making power is vested in one node (the leader). This setup provides linearizability and consistency but introduces failover challenges.

:p What does a single-leader database rely on for making decisions?
??x
A single-leader database relies on the leader node to make critical decisions such as transaction commits, message ordering, lock acquisition, leadership, and uniqueness constraints.
x??

---

**Rating: 8/10**

#### Consensus in Single-Leader Database
Background context: A single-leader approach can handle decision-making but faces issues if the leader fails or becomes unreachable. Three approaches are discussed for handling this situation.

:p What are the three ways to handle a failed leader in a single-leader database?
??x
1. Wait for the leader to recover.
2. Manually fail over by choosing a new leader.
3. Use an algorithm to automatically choose a new leader.
x??

---

**Rating: 8/10**

#### Fault-Tolerant Consensus Algorithms
Background context: Even with a leader, consensus algorithms are still required for maintaining leadership and handling leadership changes. Tools like ZooKeeper can provide outsourced consensus, failure detection, and membership services.

:p Why is consensus still necessary in single-leader databases?
??x
Consensus is still necessary because it ensures that the system can handle leader failures or network interruptions by automatically selecting a new leader.

#### Systems of Record vs. Derived Data
In distributed systems, data can be managed and processed by different types of data systems. A system of record is the authoritative version of your data where new data is first written and each fact is represented exactly once (typically normalized). Derived data systems transform or process existing data from a system of record to serve specific needs such as caching, indexing, materialized views, or predictive summary data.
:p How do you distinguish between a system of record and derived data?
??x
A system of record holds the authoritative version of your data where new data is written. Derived data systems are transformations or processing of existing data from a system of record to serve specific needs like caching, indexing, or analytics. The key difference lies in their purpose: a system of record is the source of truth, while derived data supports performance optimization and flexibility.
