#### Policy Gradient Theorem

Background context: The policy gradient theorem provides a way to update policies in reinforcement learning without needing explicit knowledge of the state distribution. It is particularly useful for gradient ascent on performance measures.

Relevant formulas and explanations:
\[ \frac{\partial J(\theta)}{\partial \theta} = E_{\pi}\left[ \sum_a q_\pi(s,a) r_\pi(a|s,\theta) \right] / \text{episode length} \]
For the episodic case, this simplifies to:
\[ \frac{\partial J(\theta)}{\partial \theta} \propto E_{\pi}\left[ \sum_a q_\pi(s,a) r_\pi(a|s,\theta) \right] \]

:p What does the policy gradient theorem provide a way to do?
??x
The policy gradient theorem provides a method for updating policies in reinforcement learning by approximating the gradient of performance with respect to the policy parameter, without needing explicit knowledge of the state distribution.

#### REINFORCE Algorithm

Background context: The REINFORCE algorithm is an application of the policy gradient theorem specifically designed for episodic tasks. It updates the policy based on sampled actions and their returns.

Relevant formulas and explanations:
\[ \frac{\partial J(\theta)}{\partial \theta} = E_{\pi}\left[ G_t r_\pi(A_t|S_t,\theta) / \pi(A_t|S_t,\theta) \right] \]
Where \( G_t \) is the return, and the update rule for REINFORCE is:
\[ \theta_{t+1} = \theta_t + \alpha G_t r_\pi(A_t|S_t,\theta_t) / \pi(A_t|S_t,\theta_t) \]

:p What is the main idea behind the REINFORCE algorithm?
??x
The main idea behind the REINFORCE algorithm is to update the policy based on sampled actions and their returns, where each increment in the parameter vector is proportional to the product of the return \( G_t \) and a vector that represents the gradient of the probability of taking the action.

#### REINFORCE Pseudocode

Background context: The pseudocode for REINFORCE shows how to implement the algorithm in practice, including handling the discounted case.

Relevant formulas and explanations:
The update rule is modified to handle discounting as follows:
\[ \theta_{t+1} = \theta_t + \alpha G_t r_\pi(A_t|S_t,\theta_t) / \pi(A_t|S_t,\theta_t) \]

:p What does the pseudocode for REINFORCE look like?
??x
The pseudocode for REINFORCE looks as follows:
```java
REINFORCE: Monte-Carlo Policy-Gradient Control (episodic)
for π* Input: a differentiable policy parameterization π(a|s,θ) 
Algorithm parameter: step size α > 0 Initialize policy parameter θ ∈ R^d (e.g., to 0) Loop forever (for each episode): Generate an episode S_0, A_0, R_1,...,S_{T-1},A_{T-1},R_T, following π(·|·,θ) Loop for each step of the episode t=0,1,...,T-1: G = ∑_{k=t+1}^T r_k (G_t) θ + α G_t * rlnπ(A_t|S_t,θ)
```

#### Performance on Short-Corridor Gridworld

Background context: The performance of REINFORCE is demonstrated using the short-corridor gridworld example.

Relevant formulas and explanations:
The plot shows the total reward per episode as a function of episodes for different step sizes. With a good step size, the total reward per episode approaches the optimal value of the start state.

:p What does Figure 13.1 show?
??x
Figure 13.1 shows the performance of REINFORCE on the short-corridor gridworld from Example 13.1, demonstrating how with an appropriate step size, the total reward per episode can approach the optimal value of the start state.

#### REINFORCE as a Stochastic Gradient Method
REINFORCE is described as a stochastic gradient method for policy learning, which has good theoretical convergence properties. The expected update over an episode is aligned with the performance gradient, ensuring improvement when the step size is sufficiently small and under standard stochastic approximation conditions.

:p What does REINFORCE as a stochastic gradient method imply?
??x
REINFORCE treats the parameters of the policy as if they were the parameters of a function to be optimized. It uses the policy's action probabilities to compute gradients, which are then used to update the policy parameters in a direction that is expected to improve performance. The key idea is to approximate the gradient of the expected return with respect to the policy parameters using Monte Carlo sampling.

For example, if we have a policy parameterized by \(\theta\), and an episode results in actions \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_T\) given states \(s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_T\), the update rule for REINFORCE is:
\[ \Delta \theta = \alpha \sum_{t=1}^{T} r_t \nabla_\theta \log \pi(a_t | s_t; \theta) \]
where \(r_t\) is the return up to time step \(t\), and \(\alpha\) is the learning rate. This update rule can be derived by applying the definition of the gradient in a stochastic setting.

```python
def reinforce_update(theta, states, actions, returns, alpha):
    """
    Perform an update using REINFORCE.
    
    :param theta: Current policy parameters
    :param states: List of states for each time step
    :param actions: List of actions taken at each state
    :param returns: List of returns corresponding to the actions
    :param alpha: Learning rate
    """
    gradient = sum([returns[t] * log(probability_of_action(theta, s)) 
                    for t, (s, a) in enumerate(zip(states, actions))])
    theta += alpha * gradient
```

#### Policy Gradient Theorem with Baseline
The policy gradient theorem can be extended to include a baseline \(b(s)\), which is any function that does not vary with the action. This extended form of the policy gradient theorem helps in reducing the variance of the updates, potentially leading to faster learning.

:p How does including a baseline in the policy gradient theorem affect the update rule?
??x
Including a baseline \(b(s)\) in the policy gradient theorem modifies the update rule as follows:
\[ \nabla J(\theta) = E_{s,a} [r(a|s; \theta)(q(s, a) - b(s))\nabla_\theta \log \pi(a | s; \theta)] \]
where \(J(\theta)\) is the expected return with respect to the policy parameterized by \(\theta\), and \(q(s, a)\) is the action value function.

The update rule for REINFORCE with baseline can be written as:
\[ \theta_{t+1} = \theta_t + \alpha \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} (G_t - b(S_t)) r(\pi(a_t | S_t; \theta_t))\nabla_\theta \log \pi(a_t | S_t; \theta_t) \]

Here, \(G_t\) is the return accumulated from time step \(t\) to the end of an episode.

```python
def reinforce_with_baseline_update(theta, states, actions, returns, baseline_func, alpha):
    """
    Perform an update using REINFORCE with a learned state-value function.
    
    :param theta: Current policy parameters
    :param states: List of states for each time step
    :param actions: List of actions taken at each state
    :param returns: List of returns corresponding to the actions
    :param baseline_func: Function that estimates the value of a given state
    :param alpha: Learning rate
    """
    gradient = 0
    for t, (s, a) in enumerate(zip(states, actions)):
        G_t = sum(returns[t:])
        b_s = baseline_func(s)
        r_t = returns[t]
        prob = probability_of_action(theta, s)
        log_prob = log(probability_of_action(theta, s))
        gradient += (G_t - b_s) * r_t * log_prob
    theta += alpha * gradient
```

#### REINFORCE with Baseline Algorithm
The provided pseudocode for REINFORCE with baseline outlines an algorithm that includes a learned state-value function as the baseline. This approach helps in reducing the variance of the updates, potentially speeding up learning.

:p What is the key difference between standard REINFORCE and REINFORCE with baseline?
??x
The key difference lies in how they handle the variance in their update rules:

- **Standard REINFORCE**: The update rule for REINFORCE does not include a baseline. It relies on sampling returns directly from episodes, which can lead to high variance.
  \[ \theta_{t+1} = \theta_t + \alpha G_t r(\pi(a_t | s_t; \theta_t))\nabla_\theta \log \pi(a_t | s_t; \theta_t) \]

- **REINFORCE with Baseline**: By including a baseline \(b(s)\), the update rule is adjusted to:
  \[ \theta_{t+1} = \theta_t + \alpha (G_t - b(S_t)) r(\pi(a_t | S_t; \theta_t))\nabla_\theta \log \pi(a_t | S_t; \theta_t) \]

This adjustment can significantly reduce the variance of the updates, especially in environments where actions have similar values.

```python
def reinforce_with_baseline_algorithm(num_episodes, num_steps, learning_rate_theta, learning_rate_w, policy_network, value_network):
    """
    Perform policy learning using REINFORCE with a learned state-value function.
    
    :param num_episodes: Number of episodes to train over
    :param num_steps: Number of steps per episode
    :param learning_rate_theta: Learning rate for the policy parameters
    :param learning_rate_w: Learning rate for the value network weights
    :param policy_network: Function approximator for the policy
    :param value_network: Function approximator for the state-value function
    """
    # Training loop
    for episode in range(num_episodes):
        states, actions, returns = generate_episode(policy_network)
        baseline_values = [value_network(state) for state in states]
        update_policy_and_value_function(states, actions, returns, baseline_values, learning_rate_theta, learning_rate_w, policy_network, value_network)
```

#### Learned State-Value Function as Baseline
In REINFORCE with baseline, the state-value function can be used to provide a more accurate estimate of the expected return, thereby reducing the variance in updates. This is especially useful when the values of actions vary widely.

:p Why might one choose to use a learned state-value function as the baseline?
??x
A learned state-value function \( \hat{v}(s; w) \) can be used as the baseline because it provides an estimate of the expected return from any given state, which can help in differentiating between actions more effectively. When actions have similar values, a random baseline might not be sufficient to differentiate them well.

The key benefits include:
- **Reduced Variance**: The learned value function can capture the structure of the environment better than a simple constant or average reward.
- **Improved Learning Speed**: By reducing variance, the learning process becomes more efficient and stable.

```python
def update_value_network(states, returns, learning_rate_w):
    """
    Update the weights of the state-value network using gradient descent.
    
    :param states: List of states from episodes
    :param returns: Corresponding list of returns for each state
    :param learning_rate_w: Learning rate for updating value function parameters
    """
    # Perform batch update on value network
    pass
```

#### Actor–Critic Methods Overview
Actor–Critic methods combine elements of policy gradients and value-based learning. They learn a policy (actor) and an approximate state-value function (critic). The critic provides feedback to improve the actor through bootstrapping, which is not just as a baseline for REINFORCE.
:p What are Actor–Critic methods?
??x
Actor–Critic methods combine elements of policy gradients and value-based learning. They learn both a policy and an approximate state-value function. The critic’s role in these methods goes beyond just providing a baseline for the actor; it is used to bootstrap the value estimates, which introduces bias but can reduce variance and accelerate learning.

#### REINFORCE with Baseline
REINFORCE with a baseline learns both a policy and an approximate state-value function. However, it is not considered an Actor–Critic method because its state-value function is only used as a baseline, not for bootstrapping.
:p What distinguishes REINFORCE with a baseline from Actor–Critic methods?
??x
REINFORCE with a baseline learns both a policy and an approximate state-value function. However, it uses the state-value function only as a baseline to reduce variance, rather than for bootstrapping (updating value estimates based on future states). This is why REINFORCE-with-baseline does not fully qualify as an Actor–Critic method.

#### One-Step Actor–Critic Method
The one-step actor–critic method replaces the full return of REINFORCE with a one-step return and uses a learned state-value function as the baseline. This method is fully online and incremental, avoiding eligibility traces.
:p What is the main feature of one-step Actor–Critic methods?
??x
One-step Actor–Critic methods replace the full return used in REINFORCE with a single-step return and utilize a learned state-value function as a baseline. These methods are designed to be fully online and incremental, avoiding the complexities of eligibility traces.

#### Pseudocode for One-Step Actor–Critic Method
The following pseudocode outlines how one-step Actor–Critic methods work:

```pseudocode
One-step Actor-Critic (episodic), for estimating ππ*:
Input: a differentiable policy parameterization π(a|s,✓)
Input: a differentiable state-value function parameterization ˆv(s,w)
Parameters: step sizes α✓ >0, αw >0

Initialize policy parameter ✓ ∈ Rd0 and state-value weights w ∈ Rd (e.g., to 0)

Loop forever (for each episode):
    Initialize S (first state of episode)

    While S is not terminal:
        A ← π(·|S, ✓) // Take action based on current policy
        R <- Gt:t+1 - ˆv(S,w)  // One-step return
        w <- w + αw * (R - ˆv(S,w))  // Update state-value function weights
        ✓ <- ✓ + α✓ * R / π(A|S,✓)   // Update policy parameters
        S <- S0  // Move to next state
```
:p What does the one-step Actor–Critic method do?
??x
The one-step Actor–Critic method updates the policy and state-value function in an online manner using a single-step return. The policy is updated based on the difference between the actual return and the predicted value from the state-value function, while the state-value function weights are adjusted to minimize this difference.

#### Generalization of One-Step Actor–Critic Method
Generalizations to n-step methods and @return algorithms involve replacing the one-step return with a longer horizon or a more complex return calculation. This can provide better performance but requires more computational resources.
:p How do you generalize the one-step Actor–Critic method?
??x
The one-step Actor–Critic method can be generalized by using n-step returns instead of just a single step. The generalization involves replacing the one-step return in (13.12) with Gt:t+n or Gt:tr, respectively. This allows for more sophisticated bootstrapping and potentially better performance but increases computational complexity.

#### Actor–Critic with Eligibility Traces
The actor–critic method using eligibility traces maintains the online nature of learning by updating parameters based on past actions and states. It uses separate eligibility traces for the policy and state-value function, making it more flexible.
:p What is an advantage of using eligibility traces in Actor–Critic methods?
??x
Using eligibility traces in Actor–Critic methods allows for a fully online update mechanism that considers contributions from past actions and states. This method maintains the incremental nature of learning while providing a way to handle delayed reinforcements effectively, making it more flexible compared to other approaches.

#### Pseudocode for Actor–Critic with Eligibility Traces
The following pseudocode outlines how actor–critic methods with eligibility traces work:

```pseudocode
Actor-Critic with Eligibility Traces (episodic), for estimating ππ*:
Input: a differentiable policy parameterization π(a|s,✓)
Input: a differentiable state-value function parameterization ˆv(s,w)
Parameters: trace-decay rates γ✓ ∈ [0,1], γw ∈ [0,1]; step sizes α✓ >0, αw >0

    Initialize S (first state of episode)
    z✓ <- 0 (d0-component eligibility trace vector)
    zw <- 0 (d-component eligibility trace vector)

    While S is not terminal:
        A <- π(·|S, ✓) // Take action based on current policy
        R <- Gt:t+n - ˆv(S,w)  // n-step return or @return value
        zw <- γw * zw + r + ˆv(S,w)  // Update state-value function eligibility trace
        z✓ <- γ✓ * z✓ + I * π(A|S,✓) / π(A|S,✓)  // Update policy eligibility trace
        w <- w + αw * (zw - ˆv(S,w))  // Update state-value function weights
        ✓ <- ✓ + α✓ * R * z✓  // Update policy parameters
        S <- S0  // Move to next state
```
:p What does the Actor–Critic with Eligibility Traces method do?
??x
The actor–critic method using eligibility traces updates both the policy and state-value function based on past actions and states. It maintains online learning by updating parameters incrementally, considering contributions from previous steps. This approach uses separate eligibility traces for the policy and state-value function to handle delayed reinforcements effectively.
