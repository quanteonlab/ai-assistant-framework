#### Truncated Version of General O↵-Policy Return

Truncation is a common technique used to approximate full non-truncated -returns. For state-based returns, we generalize (12.18) as follows:
\[ G_{s,t} = \gamma^t \left( R_{t+1} + \beta_{t+1} V_\pi(S_{t+1}, w_t) + \beta_{t+1} G_{s,t+1} \right) + (1 - \gamma^t)V_\pi(S_t, w_t) \]
Where \( \beta_t = \frac{\pi(A_t|S_t)}{b(A_t|S_t)} \).

The truncated version is often approximated as:
\[ G_{s,t} \approx V_\pi(S_t, w_t) + \beta_t \sum_{k=t}^\infty \gamma^k (V_\pi(S_k, w_k) - V_\pi(S_{k-1}, w_{k-1})) \]

:p How is the truncated version of the general o↵-policy return defined?
??x
The truncated version of the general o↵-policy return is defined using a summation over time, where each term represents the difference between the value function at different states. This approximation becomes exact if the approximate value function does not change.
```java
// Pseudocode for updating w in one step
w_t+1 = w_t + alpha * (V_hat(S_t, w_t) + beta_t * sum(gamma^k * V_hat(S_k, w_k) - V_hat(S_{k-1}, w_{k-1}) for k=t to infinity))
```

#### Forward View Update

The forward view update is a way of approximating the truncated return by considering each step from the current time \( t \). For state-based returns, it can be written as:
\[ w_{t+1} = w_t + \alpha (G_{s,t} - V_\pi(S_t, w_t)) \]
Where:
- \( G_{s,t} \) is defined in equation (12.24).
- \( V_\pi(S_t, w_t) \) is the value function at state \( S_t \).

:p What is the formula for the forward view update?
??x
The formula for the forward view update is:
\[ w_{t+1} = w_t + \alpha (G_{s,t} - V_\pi(S_t, w_t)) \]
Where \( G_{s,t} \) approximates the return and accounts for the importance sampling ratio.
```java
// Pseudocode for forward view update
w_next = w_current + alpha * (G_s_t - V_hat(S_t, w_current))
```

#### Backward View Update

The backward view update is derived by summing the forward view updates over time. This leads to an expression that can be interpreted as an eligibility trace:
\[ \sum_{t=1}^\infty (w_{t+1} - w_t) = \alpha \sum_{t=1}^\infty \sum_{k=t}^\infty (\gamma^k V_\pi(S_k, w_k) - \gamma^{k-1} V_\pi(S_{k-1}, w_{k-1})) \]

:p How is the backward view update derived?
??x
The backward view update is derived by summing the forward view updates over time. This leads to an expression that can be interpreted as an eligibility trace:
\[ \sum_{t=1}^\infty (w_{t+1} - w_t) = \alpha \sum_{t=1}^\infty \sum_{k=t}^\infty (\gamma^k V_\pi(S_k, w_k) - \gamma^{k-1} V_\pi(S_{k-1}, w_{k-1})) \]
This can be simplified to:
\[ z_t = \gamma t (w_t - w_{t-1}) + r(S_t, A_t, w_t) \]
Where \( z_t \) is the eligibility trace.
```java
// Pseudocode for backward view update
for each time step t {
    z[t] += alpha * (V_hat(S_t, w) - V_hat(S_{t-1}, w))
}
```

#### Action-Based O↵-Policy Return

For action-based returns, the general o↵-policy return is defined as:
\[ G_a^t = R_{t+1} + \beta_{t+1} \left( (1 - \beta_{t+1}) V_\pi(S_{t+1}, w_t) + \beta_{t+1} \left( \gamma G_a^{t+1} + (1 - \gamma) V_\pi(S_{t+1}, w_t) \right) \right) \]
Where:
- \( \beta_{t+1} = \frac{\pi(A_{t+1}|S_{t+1})}{b(A_{t+1}|S_{t+1})} \)
- \( V_\pi(S_{t+1}, w_t) \) is the action-value function.

The truncated version of this return can be approximated as:
\[ G_a^t \approx Q(S_t, A_t, w_t) + 1 \sum_{k=t}^\infty \beta_k (Q(S_k, A_k, w_k) - Q(S_{k-1}, A_{k-1}, w_{k-1})) \]

Where:
- \( \beta_{t+1} = \frac{\pi(A_{t+1}|S_{t+1})}{b(A_{t+1}|S_{t+1})} \)
- \( V_\pi(S_{t+1}, w_t) \) is the action-value function.
This approximation becomes exact if the approximate value function does not change.
```java
// Pseudocode for updating Q in one step
Q_next = Q_current + alpha * (R_next + beta_next * (V_hat(S_next, A_next, w) + (1 - beta_next) * V_hat(S_next, w)))
```

#### Action-Based Forward View Update

The forward view update for action-based returns is derived similarly to the state-based case:

```java
// Pseudocode for action-based forward view update
w_next = w_current + alpha * (G_a_t - Q_hat(S_t, A_t, w_current))
```

??x
Under episodic problems and o↵ine updating conditions, the relationship between state-based and action-based methods is subtler. While there is not an episode by episode equivalence of updates, there is an equivalence in their expectations.

#### Eligibility Traces Overview
Background context: Chapter 12 discusses various eligibility traces methods, including those that deal with oﬀ-policy learning. The key idea is to update value functions based on trajectories and target policies, even if some actions have zero probability under these policies.

:p What are the main characteristics of oﬀ-policy eligibility traces?
??x
Oﬀ-policy eligibility traces make irrevocable updates as a trajectory unfolds, whereas true Monte Carlo methods would not update any trajectory where an action has zero probability under the target policy. These methods still bootstrap but cancel out in expected value. The practical consequences have yet to be fully established.

:p What are the dutch-trace and replacing-trace versions of oﬀ-policy eligibility traces?
??x
Dutch-trace and replacing-trace versions refer to specific implementations where updates are made but may be retracted or emphasized based on future actions. These methods help in correcting for the expected value of targets while dealing with distributional issues.

#### n-Step Expected Sarsa vs. Tree Backup
Background context: Distinguishing between n-step Expected Sarsa and n-step Tree Backup, where Tree Backup retains no importance sampling.

:p How does Tree-Backup( ) differ from Q-learning?

#### Generalization of Tree Backup to Eligibility Traces
Background context: Extending Tree Backup to eligibility traces involves weighting each length update.

:p How are the tree-backup updates for each length in TB( ) weighted?
??x
In TB( ), tree-backup updates are weighted by the bootstrapping parameter \( \lambda \). The general formula is:
\[ G_{\lambda}^a_t = R_{t+1} + \lambda t+1 \left[ (1 - \lambda_{t+1}) \bar{V}_t(S_{t+1}) + \lambda_{t+1} \sum_{a' \neq A_{t+1}} \pi(a'|S_{t+1}) q(S_{t+1}, a', w_t) + \pi(A_{t+1}|S_{t+1}) G^a_{t+1} \right] \]
This formula accounts for the weighted updates in each step of the tree structure.

#### Importance Sampling and Stability
Background context: Issues of high variance arise with oﬀ-policy methods using importance sampling.

:p What are the challenges when < 1 in oﬀ-policy algorithms?
??x
When \( \lambda < 1 \), all oﬀ-policy algorithms involve bootstrapping, leading to potential issues such as the deadly triad. They can only be guaranteed stable for tabular cases, state aggregation, and limited forms of function approximation. For more general function approximations, the parameter vector may diverge.

#### Double Expected Sarsa Extension to Eligibility Traces
Double Expected Sarsa is an extension of the Expected Sarsa algorithm that incorporates eligibility traces. This method helps in achieving stability under off-policy training and can be useful in certain reinforcement learning scenarios.

:p How might Double Expected Sarsa be extended to use eligibility traces?
??x
To extend Double Expected Sarsa with eligibility traces, one would need to integrate the eligibility trace mechanism into its update rule, allowing for more stable updates even when using off-policy data. This involves modifying the standard update formula to include an eligibility trace factor.
