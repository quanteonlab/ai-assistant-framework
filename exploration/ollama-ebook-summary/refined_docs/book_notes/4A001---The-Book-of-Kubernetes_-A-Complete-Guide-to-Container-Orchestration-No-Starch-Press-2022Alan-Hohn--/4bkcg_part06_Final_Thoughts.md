#### Token Bucket Filter (TBF) Concept
Token Bucket Filter is a method used for rate limiting or traffic shaping. It allows bursts of packets to be sent over time while maintaining an overall average rate.

In this mechanism, tokens are added to a bucket at a constant rate until the bucket reaches its maximum capacity. Each packet that needs to be transmitted consumes one token from the bucket. If there are no tokens in the bucket when a packet arrives, it is queued until tokens become available. This way, the system can control the bandwidth usage without completely blocking all traffic.

:p What is Token Bucket Filter (TBF) used for?
??x
Token Bucket Filter is used to control the transmission of data packets by limiting the average and burst rates. It ensures that bursts of packets are allowed while maintaining an overall average rate.

#### Control Groups (cgroups)
Control groups, or cgroups for short, are a Linux kernel feature used to aggregate and control resources such as CPU time, memory, and network bandwidth.

:cgroups allow for fine-grained resource management by isolating processes into groups that can be managed together. This is essential for ensuring fair resource distribution among different applications or services running on the same system.

:p What is cgroups in Linux?
??x
Control Groups (cgroups) are a Linux kernel feature that allows you to aggregate and control resources such as CPU time, memory, and network bandwidth. They enable fine-grained management of processes by isolating them into groups and controlling their resource usage collectively.
```sh
# Example of setting CPU limits with cgroups
echo 50 > /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/cpu.shares
```
This sets the CPU share limit to 50, meaning that this group will have 1/20th (or 5%) of the total available CPU time.

#### Network Isolation Using Linux Namespaces
Linux network namespaces provide a way to create isolated network environments for processes. Each namespace has its own set of network interfaces, IP addresses, and routing tables, making it appear as if each container is running on an independent system.

:p How do Linux network namespaces enable isolation?
??x
Linux network namespaces allow you to create isolated network environments where each namespace can have its own set of network interfaces, IP addresses, and routing tables. This ensures that each process or container operates in a controlled environment without interfering with others.
```sh
# Creating a network namespace
ip netns add mynet

# Adding an interface to the new namespace
ip link set eth0 netns mynet
```
By creating a new network namespace, you can isolate network interfaces and configure them independently.

#### Container Networking Basics

Background context: Understanding how containers manage network communication is crucial for building reliable and scalable applications. Containers introduce a layer of abstraction where each container has its own virtual network devices, making it appear as a separate machine.

:p How does network isolation benefit containerized applications?
??x
Network isolation benefits containerized applications by ensuring that processes in different containers can use the same ports without conflicts. This is achieved through providing separate virtual network interfaces for each container.

#### Network Isolation vs. Host System

Background context: Containers have a different IP address space from the host system, ensuring that they appear as separate entities on the network.

:p How does network isolation prevent processes in containers from affecting each other?
??x
Network isolation prevents processes in containers from affecting each other by assigning them unique virtual network interfaces and IP addresses. This means that even if two processes are running in different containers, they can use the same port without conflict, as long as they are on separate network devices.

#### Pseudo-Code for Network Device Management

Background context: Managing network devices and addresses in containers involves setting up routes and ensuring proper communication between different parts of the network.

:p How would you configure a route in a container using pseudo-code?
??x
```python
# Example pseudo-code for configuring a route in a container
def configure_route(container_ip, destination_ip, gateway):
    # Set up routing table entry
    route_table_entry = f"{destination_ip} via {gateway}"
    # Add the route to the routing table
    add_route(container_ip, route_table_entry)
```
This pseudo-code outlines the basic steps for configuring a route in a container by adding an appropriate entry to the routing table.

#### Network Namespaces Overview
Background context explaining network namespaces. Network namespaces allow different processes to have their own isolated view of the networking stack, including IP addresses, routing tables, and sockets. This isolation is crucial for containerization and virtualization environments.

:p What are network namespaces, and why are they important in containerized environments like CRI-O?
??x
Network namespaces provide a way to isolate different processes from each other when it comes to the networking stack. Each namespace has its own IP address space, routing tables, and interfaces. This isolation is essential for containers because it allows multiple services running on the same host to have separate network configurations without interfering with each other.

In CRI-O, network namespaces are used by default to ensure that each container runs in an isolated network environment. This means that even if two containers run different instances of NGINX, they can both listen on port 80 because their network interfaces are treated as separate entities within the namespace.

#### Running Commands with `ip netns exec`
Background context explaining how the `ip netns exec` command can be used to run specific commands within a network namespace, providing detailed information about processes and network interfaces.

:p How do we use `ip netns exec` to run commands inside a network namespace?
??x
We use the `ip netns exec` command followed by the network namespace identifier and then the command we want to execute:

```bash
ip netns exec $NETNS ip addr
```

This allows us to see detailed information about the network interfaces within that specific network namespace, such as IP addresses assigned to interfaces.

#### Creating Network Namespaces
Background context: Network namespaces allow for the creation of isolated network environments on a single host. Each namespace can have its own network stack, interfaces, routing tables, and iptables rules.

:p How do you create a new network namespace?
??x
To create a new network namespace, use the `ip netns add` command followed by the name of the namespace.
```shell
root@host01:/opt# ip netns add myns
```

#### Configuring the Loopback Interface
Background context: The loopback interface is crucial for basic network stack testing, ensuring that a namespace can send and receive packets locally.

:p How do you configure the loopback interface in a network namespace?
??x
First, use `ip netns exec` to execute commands within the specified namespace. Then, bring up the loopback interface using `ip link set dev lo up`.
```shell
root@host01:/opt# ip netns exec myns ip link set dev lo up
```
After that, verify the configuration with:
```shell
root@host01:/opt# ip netns exec myns ip addr
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue ...
```
