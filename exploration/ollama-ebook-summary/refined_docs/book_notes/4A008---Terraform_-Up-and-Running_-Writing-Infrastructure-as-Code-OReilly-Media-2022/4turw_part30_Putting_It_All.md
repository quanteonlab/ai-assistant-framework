#### Application and Infrastructure Code Workflows
This text describes the application and infrastructure code workflows used by teams. It covers version control, testing, coding changes, automated tests, merging, deployment strategies, and promotion across environments.
:p What are some key differences between application code and infrastructure code workflows?
??x
Application code and infrastructure code have distinct workflows but share common practices such as using version control, running tests, making changes, and submitting pull requests. Infrastructure code typically uses Terraform for provisioning and managing resources.

- **Application Code Workflow**:
  - Version Control: Use branches.
  - Testing: Run unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, static analysis.
  - Changes: Make changes locally, push to a branch for review.
  - Deployment: Deploy with orchestration tools like Kubernetes or Mesos; use deployment strategies like rolling updates.

- **Infrastructure Code Workflow**:
  - Version Control: Use branches and tags.
  - Testing: Use `terraform plan` before applying changes.
  - Changes: Make changes in the infrastructure code, run tests.
  - Deployment: Deploy with Terraform tools like Atlantis or Terraform Cloud; promote versioned artifacts across environments.

The key difference is that application code focuses on development, testing, and deployment of software, while infrastructure code manages cloud resources and their configurations.

#### Git Tagging for Version Control
This section explains the process of using git tags to create versioned, immutable artifacts. It highlights the importance of creating a tagged commit in the repository as a reference point for deployments.
:p How does tagging help in managing application and infrastructure code?
??x
Git tags help in managing both application and infrastructure code by creating versioned, immutable artifacts that can be referenced during deployment processes. For application code:
- Tags are used to create versioned releases that can be tested and deployed.

For infrastructure code:
- Git tags ensure that specific versions of Terraform configurations are saved, which can be applied consistently across different environments.
- This approach helps in maintaining a historical record of changes and ensures that the same configuration is used for deployment, promoting consistency and reproducibility.

Example command to create a tag:
```bash
git tag -a v0.0.7 -m "Version 0.0.7"
```
This creates a tagged commit `v0.0.7` in the repository that can be referenced during deployments.

#### Deployment Strategies
The text outlines various deployment strategies, including rolling updates, blue-green deployments, and canary releases. It also mentions running deployments on CI servers with limited permissions to promote versioned artifacts across environments.
:p What are some common deployment strategies mentioned?
??x
Common deployment strategies mentioned include:
- **Rolling Updates**: Gradually deploy new versions of the application to a subset of users or infrastructure before fully rolling out.
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Deploy a new version of an application on a separate set of instances (blue) and switch traffic from the old version (green) to the new one once it is ready.
- **Canary Releases**: Gradually roll out a new version to a small subset of users or infrastructure before fully deploying.

These strategies help in managing risk, ensuring smooth transitions, and allowing for rollback if issues arise. Additionally, running deployments on CI servers with limited permissions can ensure that deployment processes are secure and controlled.

#### Environment Promotion
This text explains the process of promoting artifacts from development to production environments through automated workflows involving approval steps.
:p How does promotion work in this context?
??x
Promotion involves moving versioned, immutable artifacts (like tagged commits) across different environments such as staging, testing, and production. The key steps include:
- Using git tags to create a versioned artifact.
- Promoting the same artifact through various environments by running `terraform apply` or similar commands.
- Optionally, using CI/CD pipelines with approval workflows to ensure changes are reviewed before deployment.

Example of promoting an artifact from staging to production might involve these steps:
1. Tag the commit in the repository (`git tag v0.0.7`).
2. Push the tag to the remote repository.
3. Run `terraform apply` in the production environment with the tagged configuration.

This ensures that the same version is used across environments, maintaining consistency and reducing errors.

#### Immutable, Versioned Artifacts
Background context: This section discusses managing Terraform artifacts (code) as immutable and versioned entities to promote them from one environment to another. This approach ensures that changes are controlled, traceable, and repeatable.

:p What is the main idea behind promoting an immutable, versioned artifact of Terraform code?
??x
The main idea is to manage Terraform code in a way that it remains immutable (unchanging once deployed) while allowing for versioning. This allows teams to promote changes from one environment (e.g., development, staging) to another (e.g., production) systematically and reliably.

For example, when making a change in the development environment:
```terraform
module "example" {
  source  = "./modules/example"
  version = "1.0.2"
}
```
After testing, you might want to promote this to staging by bumping the version number or changing the module's code.

??x
The approach helps maintain consistency and traceability across environments while providing a rollback mechanism if something goes wrong in production.
```terraform
module "example" {
  source  = "./modules/example"
  version = "1.0.3" # New version after testing
}
```

#### Conclusion on Terraform Usage
Background context: The passage concludes by summarizing the various aspects of using Terraform, highlighting its capabilities and benefits in real-world scenarios.

:p What does this section conclude about the usage of Terraform?
??x
The conclusion summarizes that readers have learned a wide range of topics necessary for using Terraform effectively, including writing code, managing state, creating reusable modules, handling secrets, working across multiple regions and clouds, writing production-grade code, testing, and collaborating as a team.

It emphasizes the importance of remembering to run `terraform destroy` in each module when done with deployments.
??x
The summary underscores that Terraform, through its capabilities like modules, version control, and automated testing, allows teams to apply software engineering principles to infrastructure management. This results in faster deployments and better responses to changes.

Additionally, the passage reminds users to clean up resources by running `terraform destroy` when necessary.
```bash
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```
