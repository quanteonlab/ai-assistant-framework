#### Weaknesses of Server Testing Tools
Server testing tools have several limitations that make them less than ideal for comprehensive infrastructure testing. They are slow due to needing a full apply cycle, which includes deploying servers and waiting for deployment completion. This can lead to flaky tests because real-world issues may arise during this process. Additionally, these tools require authentication to a real provider (such as AWS) and necessitate the deployment/undeployment of actual resources, which incurs both time and cost.

:p What are some key weaknesses of server testing tools?
??x
The key weaknesses include slowness due to needing a full apply cycle with real servers, flakiness from intermittent issues during real-world deployments, and the necessity for authentication and resource deployment/undeployment which can be costly. 
```pseudocode
# Example pseudocode to illustrate the process of server testing
def testRealServers():
    # Apply changes to infrastructure
    applyChanges()
    # Wait for servers to deploy
    waitForDeploymentCompletion()
    # Run tests on deployed servers
    runTestsOnDeployedServers()
```

#### Infrastructure Code Rots Quickly Without Tests
Infrastructure code without automated tests quickly rots, meaning it becomes unreliable and harder to maintain. Manual testing and reviews help initially but eventually fail to catch all bugs. Automated tests are essential because they catch nontrivial bugs that manual testing might miss.

:p Why is infrastructure code with no automated tests considered broken?
??x
Infrastructure code without automated tests is considered broken because real-world changes and evolving tooling can introduce many nontrivial bugs, which manual tests might not detect. Automated tests help in identifying these issues early and maintaining the reliability of the infrastructure.

```pseudocode
# Example pseudocode to illustrate adding an automated test
def addAutomatedTest():
    # Write a test that checks server functionality
    writeFunctionalityTests()
    # Run tests after every commit
    runTestsAfterEveryCommit()
```

#### Importance of Smaller Modules in Testing
Smaller modules are easier and faster to test because they have fewer moving parts, making it simpler to identify issues. Larger monolithic modules can be complex and harder to manage.

:p Why are smaller modules better for testing?
??x
Smaller modules are better for testing because they contain fewer components, which makes them easier to understand, maintain, and debug. This reduces the complexity of tests and speeds up the development process by allowing quick iterations and validation.

```pseudocode
# Example pseudocode illustrating how to create a smaller module
def createSmallerModule():
    # Define a small, focused Terraform configuration file
    writeSmallTerraformConfig()
    # Write corresponding unit or integration tests for this config
    writeTestsForSmallConfig()
```

#### Adopting Infrastructure as Code in Your Team
Background context: In the real world, you will likely work within a team that needs to adopt Terraform and IaC tools. Convincing your team of its benefits is crucial for successful implementation.

:p How do you convince your team to use Terraform and other infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tools?
??x
To convince the team, highlight the benefits such as improved reliability, reproducibility, version control, and easier collaboration. Emphasize how IaC can lead to more maintainable and consistent infrastructure.

Example scenario:
- Improving the onboarding process by ensuring new developers have a uniform environment.
- Reducing operational costs through automation and error reduction in manual processes.

#### Workflow for Deploying Infrastructure Code
Background context: When deploying infrastructure code, you need a workflow that allows multiple team members to understand and modify Terraform scripts safely. This involves version control systems like Git.

:p What are the steps involved in setting up a workflow for deploying infrastructure code?
??x
Steps include:
1. Setting up Terraform configurations.
2. Using Git for version control of these configurations.
3. Creating branches for new features or modifications.
4. Merging changes into main branches after thorough testing.
5. Running `terraform apply` to update the environment.

Example Git branch strategy:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/new-vpc main
# Make necessary Terraform changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add a new VPC"
git push origin feature/new-vpc
```

#### Putting It All Together
Background context: Integrating all the above workflows ensures that both application code and infrastructure are managed effectively. This involves aligning with existing tech stacks, integrating CI/CD tools, and maintaining best practices.

:p How do you integrate all the workflows for deploying both application code and infrastructure?
??x
Integration involves:
1. Aligning Terraform configurations with Git repositories.
2. Setting up CI/CD pipelines to automate Terraform deployments.
3. Maintaining a clear separation of concerns between application code and infrastructure.
4. Regularly reviewing and updating processes based on feedback.

Example integration in Jenkins:
```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Initialize') { 
            steps { script { 
                sh 'terraform init' 
            }}
        }
        stage('Plan') {
            steps { script { 
                sh 'terraform plan -out=tfplan'
            }}
        }
        stage('Apply') {
            steps { script { 
                sh 'terraform apply tfplan --auto-approve'
            }}
        }
    }
}
```

#### Skills Gap
Background context: Adopting IaC often requires Ops engineers to spend most of their time writing code, which can be a significant transition from their usual manual tasks. While some may embrace the change, others might find it challenging due to the need for new skills or hiring additional staff.
:p How does the adoption of IaC create a "skills gap" in your team?
??x
The adoption of IaC creates a skills gap as Ops engineers are required to transition from managing infrastructure manually to writing large amounts of code using tools like Terraform, Go tests, Chef recipes, etc. This shift can be difficult for some engineers who may need to learn new programming languages and techniques, while others might enjoy the change.
