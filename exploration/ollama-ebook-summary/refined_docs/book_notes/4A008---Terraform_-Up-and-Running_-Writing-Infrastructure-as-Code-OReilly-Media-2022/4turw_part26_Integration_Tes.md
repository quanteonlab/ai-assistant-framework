# High-Quality Flashcards: 4A008---Terraform_-Up-and-Running_-Writing-Infrastructure-as-Code-OReilly-Media-2022_processed (Part 26)


**Starting Chapter:** Integration Tests

---


#### Integration Tests Overview
Integration tests are designed to test how different components of a system interact with each other. Unlike unit tests, which focus on isolated functions or methods, integration tests simulate real-world scenarios where these components are brought together and tested as a whole.

In this example, we're using Ruby to write an integration test for a simple web server. The goal is to ensure that the web server correctly responds to HTTP requests.
:p What is the main difference between unit tests and integration tests?
??x
Unit tests focus on individual components or functions in isolation, while integration tests check how these components work together as part of the system. Integration tests are typically slower because they involve setting up a complete environment, even if it's just for testing purposes.
x??

---


#### DoIntegrationTest Method Implementation
The `do_integration_test` method is responsible for running an HTTP server in a separate thread and then making HTTP requests to test various endpoints. This method ensures that the web server runs independently of the test code, preventing blocking.

Here’s how it works:
1. The web server starts on port 8000.
2. A new thread launches the server.
3. An HTTP request is sent to the specified path.
4. The response is validated using a provided lambda function.
5. Finally, the server is shut down after testing.
:p What does the `do_integration_test` method do?
??x
The `do_integration_test` method configures and runs an HTTP server in a background thread, sends an HTTP request to a specified path, validates the response, and then shuts down the server. Here’s its implementation:
```ruby
def do_integration_test(path, check_response)
  port = 8000
  server = WEBrick::HTTPServer.new :Port => port
  server.mount '/', WebServer

  begin
    # Start the web server in a separate thread so it doesn't block the test
    thread = Thread.new do
      server.start
    end

    # Make an HTTP request to the web server at the specified path
    uri = URI("http://localhost:#{port}#{path}")
    response = Net::HTTP.get_response(uri)

    # Use the specified check_response lambda to validate the response
    check_response.call(response)
  ensure
    # Shut down the server and thread at the end of the test
    server.shutdown
    thread.join
  end
end
```
x??

---


#### Integration Test Execution
After writing integration tests for each endpoint, you can run all the tests to see if everything works as expected.

Here’s how the command looks:
:p How do you run all the tests?
??x
You can run all the tests by executing the following command in your terminal:
```sh
$ruby web-server-test.rb
```
This command runs all the test methods defined in `web-server-test.rb` and provides a summary of the results.
x??

---


#### Performance Comparison Between Unit Tests and Integration Tests
Unit tests are generally faster because they only interact with isolated pieces of code, whereas integration tests require setting up more complex environments. In this example, the unit tests ran in 0.000572 seconds, while the integration tests took 0.221561 seconds.

:p Why are integration tests typically slower than unit tests?
??x
Integration tests are typically slower because they simulate a full system setup to test how different components interact. In this example, the Ruby web server code is minimal, so even with integration tests, it’s still quite fast (0.221561 seconds). However, in more complex systems, the overhead of setting up and tearing down an environment can significantly increase execution time.

---


#### Terraform Integration Testing Overview
In this section, we will focus on integrating modules and ensuring they work correctly together. This involves deploying several modules to validate their interaction, particularly in a testing environment isolated from production. The main objective is to ensure that all automated tests run in an isolated AWS account.
:p What does the integration test for Terraform code primarily aim to achieve?
??x
The primary goal of the integration test is to verify how multiple modules work together by deploying them and ensuring they function correctly, especially in a testing environment. This helps catch issues related to interactions between different parts of the infrastructure before deployment into production.
x??

---


#### Configuring Variables for Test Environment
To run tests in an isolated AWS account, you need to ensure that all hardcoded values are configurable. In this case, we expose `db_name` as an input variable in the MySQL module configuration so it can be set dynamically during testing.
:p How does exposing `db_name` as a variable help in running integration tests?
??x
Exposing `db_name` as a variable allows you to use test-friendly values when running integration tests. This ensures that your tests do not rely on specific configurations that might conflict with production settings, maintaining the isolation and integrity of your testing environment.
x??

---


#### Creating Database Deployment Options (`createDbOpts`)
The `createDbOpts` function initializes Terraform options for deploying the MySQL module in a testing environment. It sets unique names and credentials to avoid conflicts during tests.
:p What is the purpose of the `createDbOpts` function?
??x
The `createDbOpts` function prepares the necessary parameters for initializing and applying changes using Terraform with specific database options, ensuring that each test run has unique and isolated settings.
x??

---


#### Using Partial Configuration for Terraform Backends
Background context explaining the concept. In this scenario, you're configuring Terraform to use an S3 backend for storing state files but want to ensure that tests do not interfere with the actual production environment's state file. By using partial configuration, you can define the necessary backend settings in a separate `backend.hcl` file and pass appropriate values during testing.
If applicable, add code examples with explanations.
:p How can you use partial configuration to manage Terraform backends for testing?
??x
You can move the backend configuration from `live/stage/data-stores/mysql/main.tf` into an external file named `backend.hcl`. This way, you can define the necessary S3 bucket and key settings there. During testing, you can override these values using the `-backend-config` argument.
```bash
terraform init -backend-config=backend.hcl
```
In your test code, you use the `BackendConfig` parameter of `terraform.Options` to pass in specific values that are appropriate for testing, such as a different S3 bucket and key.
x??

---


#### Configuring Variables for the `hello-world-app` Module
Background context explaining the concept. For better modularity and flexibility, you need to expose variables in the `variables.tf` file of the `hello-world-app` module so that these values can be passed from the calling code when deploying to different environments or with different backend configurations.
:p What changes are needed to enable passing backend configuration values to the `hello-world-app` module?
??x
You need to add variables for `db_remote_state_bucket`, `db_remote_state_key`, and `environment` in the `live/stage/services/hello-world-app/variables.tf` file. These variables will be used by Terraform to configure the backend settings when deploying the `hello-world-app` module.
```hcl
variable "db_remote_state_bucket" {
  description = "The name of the S3 bucket for the database's remote state"
  type        = string
}

variable "db_remote_state_key" {
  description = "The path for the database's remote state in S3"
  type        = string
}

variable "environment" {
  description = "The name of the environment we're deploying to"
  type        = string
  default     = "stage"
}
```
Then, in `live/stage/services/hello-world-app/main.tf`, you pass these values to the `hello-world-app` module.
```hcl
module "hello_world_app" {
  source              = "../../../../modules/services/hello-world-app"
  server_text         = "Hello, World"
  environment         = var.environment
  db_remote_state_bucket = var.db_remote_state_bucket
  db_remote_state_key  = var.db_remote_state_key
  instance_type       = "t2.micro"
  min_size            = 2
  max_size            = 2
  enable_autoscaling  = false
  ami                 = data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id
}
```
x??

#### Implementing `createHelloOpts` Method for Passing Backend Configurations
Background context explaining the concept. You need a method to create and configure options for deploying the `hello-world-app` module, ensuring that it uses the same backend configuration as the `mysql` module.
:p How do you implement the `createHelloOpts` method to ensure consistency in backend configurations?
??x
The `createHelloOpts` method constructs Terraform options by leveraging the backend configuration from another set of options (`dbOpts`). It ensures that the `hello-world-app` module uses the same S3 bucket and key for its state as defined in the `mysql` module.
```go
func createHelloOpts(dbOpts *terraform.Options, terraformDir string) *terraform.Options {
  return &terraform.Options{
    TerraformDir: terraformDir,
    Vars: map[string]interface{}{
      "db_remote_state_bucket": dbOpts.BackendConfig["bucket"],
      "db_remote_state_key":    dbOpts.BackendConfig["key"],
      "environment":            dbOpts.Vars["db_name"],
    },
  }
}
```
This method takes the `dbOpts` object, which already contains the backend configuration for the `mysql` module, and uses it to populate the necessary variables for the `hello-world-app` module.

#### Integration Testing Overview
Background context explaining the purpose and significance of integration testing, especially for Terraform. This involves verifying that different modules work correctly together.

:p What is the main goal of performing an integration test as described in the text?
??x
The main goal is to ensure that several Terraform modules work correctly together by deploying and validating resources like RDS, ASGs, ALBs, and checking if they function properly. This involves running `terraform apply` on different modules and then verifying their functionality through HTTP requests.
x??

---


#### Hello World App Module Update and Validation Process
Background context: This concept outlines the process of updating a module, validating changes, and cleaning up resources using Terraform. It involves making a change to an existing module, applying these changes, and ensuring everything works as expected before proceeding further.

:p What are the steps involved in making updates to the hello-world-app module?
??x
1. Make a change to the hello-world-app module.
2. Rerun `terraform apply` on the hello-world-app module to deploy your updates.
3. Run validations to make sure everything is working correctly.
4. If everything works, proceed to the next step; if not, go back to step 3a (making changes).
5. Run `terraform destroy` on the hello-world-app module.
6. Run `terraform destroy` on the mysql module.

This process supports fast, iterative development by allowing for quick deployment and validation of changes using Terraform.
x??

#### Example Workflow with Skipping Stages
Background context: The provided text demonstrates a typical workflow where certain stages are skipped to optimize testing. This is particularly useful during development iterations, allowing you to focus on specific parts of the system.

:p How can you run tests while skipping deploy and teardown stages for the database and application?
??x
To run tests while skipping deploy and teardown stages for both the database and application, you would set the appropriate environment variables as follows:

```sh$ SKIP_teardown_db=true \
  SKIP_teardown_app=true \
  go test -timeout 30m -run 'TestHelloWorldAppStageWithStages'
```

This command ensures that only the deploy stages for both the database and application are skipped, while validation stages proceed.

x??

---


---
#### Quick Test Execution Using Environment Variables
In the provided example, environment variables are used to control which stages of a test run are executed. This is particularly useful for iterative development and testing scenarios.

Background context: The use of environment variables (`SKIP_deploy_db`, `SKIP_deploy_app`, etc.) allows developers to selectively skip certain stages of an automated test without modifying the tests themselves. This can significantly speed up the test execution process, especially when only small changes are being made during development.

:p How do you run a specific set of test stages using environment variables?
??x
You can run a specific set of test stages by setting the appropriate environment variables before running the `go test` command. For example:

```sh
SKIP_deploy_db=true \
   SKIP_deploy_app=true \
   SKIP_validate_app=true \
   go test -timeout 30m -run 'TestHelloWorldAppStageWithStages'
```

This command sets the `SKIP_deploy_db`, `SKIP_deploy_app`, and `SKIP_validate_app` environment variables to true, which instructs Terratest to skip these stages. The `-run` flag is used to specify which test functions should be executed.

In this case, only the teardown stages (`teardown_app` and `teardown_db`) are run since their respective skip flags were not set.

#### Handling Flaky Tests with Retries
The text discusses how flaky tests can occur due to transient issues such as network errors or resource availability. To make tests more resilient, retries for known errors can be configured using the `terraform.Options` structure in Terratest.

Background context: In cloud infrastructure testing, transient failures are common due to factors like network outages, race conditions, and other environmental variables. Retrying failed tests can help mitigate these issues by giving temporary errors a chance to resolve themselves before failing the test completely.

:p How can you configure retries for known errors in Terratest?
??x
You can enable retries for known errors by configuring the `terraform.Options` structure with the following fields:

```go
func createHelloOpts (dbOpts *terraform.Options, terraformDir string) *terraform.Options {
    return &terraform.Options{
        TerraformDir:     terraformDir,
        Vars:             map[string]interface{}{"..."},
        MaxRetries:       3, // Retry up to 3 times
        TimeBetweenRetries: 5 * time.Second, // Wait 5 seconds between retries
        RetryableTerraformErrors: map[string]string{
            "RequestError: send request failed": "Throttling issue?", // Custom message for this error
        },
    }
}
```

In this example, `MaxRetries` is set to 3, meaning the test will retry up to three times. The `TimeBetweenRetries` field specifies a five-second delay between retries. Additionally, the `RetryableTerraformErrors` map contains specific error messages (like "RequestError: send request failed") that should be retried along with custom messages that can help identify the cause of the failure.

:p How does Terratest handle these retry conditions during execution?
??x
When a test encounters an error listed in the `RetryableTerraformErrors` map, it will log a message indicating that the error is expected and warrants a retry. The test will then pause for the duration specified by `TimeBetweenRetries`, run again, and attempt to resolve the issue.

For example, if the test encounters a "RequestError: send request failed" during an `apply` command:

```sh
Running command terraform with args [apply -input=false -lock=false -auto-approve]
* error loading the remote state: RequestError: send request failed Post https://s3.amazonaws.com/: dial tcp 11.22.33.44:443: connect: connection refused
'terraform [apply]' failed with the error 'exit status code 1' but this error was expected and warrants a retry.
Further details: Intermittent error, possibly due to throttling?
```

The test will log a message indicating that it's expecting such an error (possibly due to throttling) and then retry the `apply` command.

#### End-to-End Tests Overview
Background context explaining end-to-end tests and their role in testing infrastructure. The test pyramid model is introduced, showing the relative positions of unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

:p What are end-to-end tests used for in the context of Terraform?
??x
End-to-end tests involve deploying the entire infrastructure from scratch and testing it as if a real user would interact with it. These tests aim to simulate the full user experience and verify that all components work together correctly.
x??

---


#### The Test Pyramid Model
The test pyramid model explains the structure of different types of tests, typically starting with many unit tests at the bottom, fewer integration tests in the middle, and a smaller number of end-to-end tests on top.

:p How is the test pyramid structured for testing Terraform infrastructure?
??x
The test pyramid suggests that you should aim to have more unit tests (bottom), followed by fewer integration tests (middle), and even fewer end-to-end tests (top). This structure reflects the increasing cost, complexity, brittleness, and runtime of tests as you move up the pyramid.
x??

---


#### Complexity and Cost in End-to-End Tests
This section discusses why end-to-end tests are rarely implemented due to their high cost and brittleness. It mentions that deploying everything from scratch can take several hours.

:p Why are end-to-end tests not commonly used for large infrastructure projects?
??x
End-to-end tests are often too slow and brittle for practical use, especially in complex infrastructures where multiple resources are involved. Deploying the entire architecture from scratch and then undeploying it takes several hours, making the feedback loop very slow and limiting bug fix attempts to one per day.
x??

---


#### Brittleness of End-to-End Tests
The probability of end-to-end tests failing due to transient errors is discussed, using a formula to calculate these odds.

:p What factors contribute to the brittleness of end-to-end tests in infrastructure deployment?
??x
End-to-end tests can fail due to intermittent issues with resources. For example, deploying N resources results in an increasing probability of failure: 99.9%N. This means that as the number of deployed resources increases, the likelihood of a successful test decreases significantly.
x??

---


#### Trade-offs in Test Pyramid
This section explains the trade-offs between different levels of tests and why lower-level testing (unit and integration) is preferred.

:p Why are unit and integration tests more favorable than end-to-end tests for Terraform infrastructure?
??x
Unit and integration tests are faster, more reliable, and provide quicker feedback loops. End-to-end tests can be too slow to run frequently, limiting bug fix attempts. They also tend to have a higher probability of failure due to transient issues with multiple resources.
x??

---


---
#### Incremental Deployment Strategy for End-to-End Testing
Background context: The provided text discusses an incremental deployment strategy used to reduce resource usage during testing and ensure that both infrastructure changes and their deployment processes are validated. This method closely mimics actual production deployments, ensuring reliability.

:p How does the described approach help in reducing test complexity while maintaining robustness?
??x
The described approach reduces test complexity by applying only incremental changes to a persistent "test" environment. By doing so, it minimizes resource deployment needs (from several hundred to just a handful), making tests faster and less brittle. This method also ensures that the deployment process itself is validated along with infrastructure functionality.

```pseudocode
1. Apply infrastructure change incrementally to test environment.
2. Run validations using Selenium or equivalent tool from end-user perspective.
3. Validate both infrastructure correctness and deployment process effectiveness.
```
x?

---


#### End-to-End Testing Strategy Overview
Background context: The text outlines an end-to-end testing strategy where changes are applied to a running "test" environment, mimicking production deployments. This approach helps in validating both the functionality of the infrastructure and the correctness of the deployment process.

:p What is the primary advantage of using incremental changes for end-to-end tests over full apply/destroy cycles?
??x
The primary advantage of using incremental changes is that it closely mirrors real-world production practices, where changes are applied gradually rather than tearing down and rebuilding the entire environment. This method ensures that both infrastructure functionality and deployment processes are validated without the overhead of frequent full-scale deployments.

```pseudocode
1. Apply change incrementally to test env.
2. Run validations (e.g., Selenium tests).
3. Ensure both infra works correctly AND deployment process is sound.
```
x?

---


#### Static Analysis for Terraform Code
Background context: The text introduces static analysis as a fundamental way to test Terraform code by parsing and analyzing it without execution, covering tools like `terraform validate`, `tfsec`, `tflint`, and `Terrascan`.

:p What is the role of static analysis in testing Terraform code?
??x
Static analysis plays a crucial role in testing Terraform code by focusing on syntax checks and identifying potential security issues or compliance violations without running the actual infrastructure. Tools like `terraform validate` can catch syntax errors, while others such as `tfsec` and `tflint` look for security and compliance issues.

```pseudocode
1. Parse and analyze Terraform code.
2. Identify syntax errors (e.g., missing parameters).
3. Detect potential security or compliance violations.
```
x?
---

---


#### Checking Resource Counts in Plan Output
Background context explaining how to use `GetResourceCount` to validate the number of resources added, changed, or destroyed during a Terraform plan execution.
:p How can you check the add/change/destroy counts from the plan output using Terratest?
??x
You can use the `terraform.GetResourceCount` helper function to parse the plan string and verify that the expected resource changes are made. For example:
```go
resourceCounts := terraform.GetResourceCount(t, planString)
require.Equal(t, 5, resourceCounts.Add)
require.Equal(t, 0, resourceCounts.Change)
require.Equal(t, 0, resourceCounts.Destroy)
```
This ensures that the plan output has the correct number of resources being added without any changes or destruction.
x??

---


#### Programmatic Access to Plan Output
Background context explaining how to use `InitAndPlanAndShowWithStructNoLogTempPlanFile` to parse the plan output into a struct, providing programmatic access to resource values and attributes.
:p How can you check specific values in the plan output using Terratest?
??x
You can use the `terraform.InitAndPlanAndShowWithStructNoLogTempPlanFile` helper function to get detailed information about resources planned for changes. For example:
```go
planStruct := terraform.InitAndPlanAndShowWithStructNoLogTempPlanFile(t, opts)
alb, exists := planStruct.ResourcePlannedValuesMap["module.alb.aws_lb.example"]
require.True(t, exists, "aws_lb resource must exist")
name, exists := alb.AttributeValues["name"]
require.True(t, exists, "missing name parameter")
require.Equal(t, albName, name)
```
This allows you to verify specific attributes of resources in the plan output.
x??

---


#### Terraform Plan and OPA Integration for Policy Enforcement
Background context: This concept explains how to integrate policy enforcement using Open Policy Agent (OPA) with Terraform plans. It covers the steps required to convert a Terraform plan into JSON, evaluate it against a policy written in Rego, and handle different outcomes based on the policy evaluation.
:p How can you enforce policies like tagging requirements using OPA with Terraform?
??x
To enforce policies such as tagging requirements using OPA with Terraform, follow these steps:
1. Run `terraform plan -out tfplan.binary` to generate a plan file in binary format.
2. Convert the plan file into JSON: `terraform show -json tfplan.binary > tfplan.json`.
3. Evaluate the JSON against your policy (e.g., `enforce_tagging.rego`) using OPA:
   ```sh
   opa eval \
       --data enforce_tagging.rego \
       --input tfplan.json \
       --format pretty \
       data.terraform.allow undefined
   ```
4. Based on the output, you can determine if the policy has passed or failed.

This process helps ensure that your Terraform configurations meet company-specific requirements before execution.
??x

---


#### Plan Testing Tools for Terraform
Background context: This concept discusses the strengths and weaknesses of plan testing tools used in conjunction with OPA to enforce policies against Terraform plans. It highlights how these tools can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines.
:p What are some key benefits and limitations of using plan testing tools like OPA for policy enforcement?
??x
Key benefits of plan testing tools include:
- They run fast, faster than unit or integration tests but not as fast as pure static analysis.
- They are somewhat easy to use, easier than unit or integration tests but not as simple as pure static analysis.
- They are stable with few flaky tests, more stable than unit or integration tests.

Limitations include:
- They can catch a wider range of errors compared to static analysis but fewer than full integration tests.
- Real provider authentication is required for plan validation.
- They do not check functionality; passing checks does not guarantee that the infrastructure works correctly.

These tools are particularly useful in CI/CD pipelines where policies need to be continuously enforced.

#### InSpec Overview
InSpec is a framework for auditing and testing infrastructure. It provides a way to define policies that can be run against your deployed servers to ensure they meet certain criteria.

:p What is InSpec, and what does it do?
??x
InSpec is an auditing and testing framework that allows you to define policies to validate the configuration of your servers. You can use it to check if files exist, permissions are set correctly, services are running, and more. The goal is to ensure that infrastructure as code (IAC) matches what is deployed in production.

```ruby
# Example InSpec code to check for a file existence and its mode
describe file('/etc/myapp.conf') do
  it { should exist }
  its('mode') { should cmp 0644 }
end
```
