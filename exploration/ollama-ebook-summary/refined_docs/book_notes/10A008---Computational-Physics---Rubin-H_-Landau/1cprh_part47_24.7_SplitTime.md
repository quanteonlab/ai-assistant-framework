#### Maxwell's Equations for EM Wave Propagation
Background context on how Maxwell’s equations describe electromagnetic wave propagation, focusing on the z-dimension with no sources or sinks.

:p What are Maxwell's equations for describing the propagation of an electromagnetic wave in free space?
??x
Maxwell's equations for describing the propagation of an electromagnetic wave in free space along the \( z \)-dimension can be written as:
\[
\nabla \cdot E = 0 \Rightarrow \frac{\partial Ex(z,t)}{\partial x} = 0,
\]
\[
\nabla \cdot H = 0 \Rightarrow \frac{\partial Hy(z,t)}{\partial y} = 0,
\]
\[
\frac{\partial E}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{\epsilon_0} \nabla \times H \Rightarrow \frac{\partial Ex(z,t)}{\partial t} = -\frac{1}{\epsilon_0} \frac{\partial Hy(z,t)}{\partial z},
\]
\[
\frac{\partial H}{\partial t} - \frac{1}{\mu_0} \nabla \times E \Rightarrow \frac{\partial Hy(z,t)}{\partial t} = -\frac{1}{\mu_0} \frac{\partial Ex(z,t)}{\partial z}.
\]
These equations describe the interdependence of \( E \) and \( H \) fields as they propagate.

#### Split-Time FDTD Algorithm for Maxwell’s Equations
Background context on solving coupled partial differential equations using central difference approximations in both time and space. The initial conditions are set to sinusoidal spatial variation, and the algorithm uses an interleaved lattice structure.

:p How does the split-time FDTD method solve Maxwell's equations?
??x
The split-time FDTD method solves Maxwell’s equations by approximating first derivatives using central differences. For instance:
\[
\frac{\partial E(z,t)}{\partial t} \approx \frac{E( z, t+\Delta t/2) - E( z, t-\Delta t/2)}{\Delta t},
\]
\[
\frac{\partial E(z,t)}{\partial z} \approx \frac{E( z+\Delta z/2, t) - E( z-\Delta z/2, t)}{\Delta z}.
\]
These approximations are substituted into the equations to form an algorithm that advances the solution in time. The algorithm uses an interleaved lattice structure where electric fields \( E \) are determined at half-integer space steps and integer time steps, while magnetic fields \( H \) are determined at integer space steps and half-integer time steps.

#### Renormalization of Electric Fields
Background context on renormalizing the electric fields to have the same dimensions as the magnetic fields for simplicity.

:p Why is it useful to renormalize the electric fields?
??x
Renormalizing the electric fields \( E \) by setting:
\[
\tilde{E} = \sqrt{\epsilon_0 \mu_0} E,
\]
helps in making the dimensions of the electric and magnetic fields consistent, simplifying the stability analysis of the algorithm. This renormalization ensures that both fields are on the same scale.

#### Split-Time FDTD Algorithm for Electromagnetic Waves

Background context: The provided text discusses the implementation of a split-time finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) algorithm for simulating electromagnetic wave propagation. Key components include the update equations for electric field \( \tilde{E}_{k, n+1/2}^x \) and magnetic field \( H_{k+1/2, n+1}^y \), as well as stability conditions derived from the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition. The speed of light in vacuum is denoted by \( c \), and the grid velocity ratio \( \beta = \frac{c \Delta z}{\Delta t} \).

Relevant formulas:
\[ \tilde{E}_{k, n+1/2}^x = \tilde{E}_{k, n-1/2}^x + \beta (H_{k-1/2, n}^y - H_{k+1/2, n}^y), \]
\[ H_{k+1/2, n+1}^y = H_{k+1/2, n}^y + \beta (\tilde{E}_{k, n+1/2}^x - \tilde{E}_{k+1, n+1/2}^x), \]
\[ \beta = \frac{c \Delta z}{\Delta t}, \quad c = \sqrt{\frac{1}{\epsilon_0 \mu_0}}. \]

The space step \( \Delta z \) and time step \( \Delta t \) must be chosen so that the algorithm remains stable. Typically, a minimum of 10 grid points per wavelength is required for stability:

\[ \Delta z \leq \frac{\lambda}{10}. \]

Stability is also ensured by the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition, which limits the time step based on the speed of light and grid spacing:
\[ \beta = \frac{c \Delta z}{\Delta t} \leq 1/2. \]

Making the time step smaller improves precision but requires a simultaneous decrease in the space step to maintain stability.

:p What is the relationship between the space step \( \Delta z \) and the wavelength \( \lambda \) for ensuring at least 10 grid points per wavelength?
??x
To ensure that at least 10 grid points fit within one wavelength, we must set the condition:

\[ \Delta z \leq \frac{\lambda}{10}. \]

This ensures sufficient spatial resolution to capture the details of the propagating wave.

#### FDTD Algorithm Implementation

Background context: The provided code example demonstrates a simple implementation of the FDTD algorithm for a 200-site lattice. Initial conditions are set as sinusoidal variations in both electric and magnetic fields, with periodic boundary conditions applied at the ends of the spatial region.

Relevant formulas:
\[ E_x(z,t=0) = 0.1 \sin\left(\frac{2\pi z}{100}\right), \]
\[ H_y(z,t=0) = 0.1 \sin\left(\frac{2\pi z}{100}\right). \]

The algorithm steps out in time, updating the fields based on the provided equations.

:p What is the initial condition for the electric field \( E_x \) at \( t = 0 \)?
??x
The initial condition for the electric field \( E_x \) at \( t = 0 \) is given by:

\[ E_x(z,t=0) = 0.1 \sin\left(\frac{2\pi z}{100}\right). \]

This represents a sinusoidal variation in the electric field with an amplitude of 0.1 and a spatial frequency corresponding to one complete wave over 100 grid points.

#### Stability Condition for FDTD Algorithm

Background context: The stability condition for the FDTD algorithm is derived from the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition, ensuring that information does not propagate faster than the speed of light on the numerical grid.

Relevant formulas:
\[ \beta = \frac{c \Delta z}{\Delta t} \leq 1/2. \]

The CFL condition ensures that the time step \( \Delta t \) is small enough relative to the spatial step \( \Delta z \):

\[ \Delta t \geq \frac{\Delta z}{2c}. \]

:p What does the stability condition for the FDTD algorithm state?
??x
The stability condition for the FDTD algorithm states that:

\[ \beta = \frac{c \Delta z}{\Delta t} \leq 1/2. \]

This ensures that the time step \( \Delta t \) is small enough such that information does not propagate faster than the speed of light on the numerical grid, maintaining stability.

#### Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) Condition

Background context: The Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition is a necessary and sufficient condition for ensuring the stability of the FDTD algorithm. It limits the time step \( \Delta t \) based on the spatial resolution \( \Delta z \) and the speed of light \( c \):

\[ \beta = \frac{c \Delta z}{\Delta t} \leq 1/2. \]

Ensuring this condition helps maintain numerical stability in simulations.

:p What is the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition for FDTD?
??x
The Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition for FDTD states that:

#### Code Example for FDTD Implementation

Background context: The following code snippet demonstrates a simple implementation of the FDTD algorithm using C/Java-like pseudocode.

:p Provide an example of how the electric field update equation might be implemented in pseudocode.
??x
Here is a pseudocode example for implementing the electric field update equation in the FDTD algorithm:

```java
// Update the electric field at position k, time step n+1/2
for (int k = 0; k < numCells - 1; k++) {
    Ex[k][n + 1 / 2] = Ex[k][n - 1 / 2]
                      + beta * (Hk_minus_1_2[n] - Hk_plus_1_2[n]);
}
```

Explanation:
- `Ex` is the electric field array.
- `numCells` is the number of cells in the lattice.
- `beta` is defined as \( \frac{c \Delta z}{\Delta t} \).
- The loop iterates over all cells except the last one, since periodic boundary conditions are applied at both ends.

This pseudocode updates the electric field at position \( k \) and time step \( n + 1/2 \) based on the magnetic fields at neighboring positions.

#### Periodic Boundary Conditions

Background context: When simulating electromagnetic waves, periodic boundary conditions are often imposed to avoid artificial reflections at the spatial boundaries. This is particularly useful for waveguide simulations or when studying propagation over a large distance.

:p How do you impose periodic boundary conditions on the fields \(Ex\) and \(Hy\)?
??x
To impose periodic boundary conditions, we assume that the values of the fields at the edges are wrapped around to the opposite edge. For instance, if the spatial domain has \(k = 0\) and \(k = x_{max} - 1\), the values can be considered as:

```python
# Example pseudocode for periodic boundary conditions
Ex[0, t] = Ex[x_max-1, t]
Hy[0, t] = Hy[x_max-1, t]

Ex[x_max-1, t] = Ex[0, t]
Hy[x_max-1, t] = Hy[0, t]
```

This ensures that the fields wrap around from one end to the other, effectively creating a seamless boundary.

#### Courant Condition Testing

Background context: The Courant condition is crucial for ensuring numerical stability in simulations of wave propagation. It involves checking the relationship between time step \(\Delta t\) and spatial step \(\Delta z\). For electromagnetic waves, it ensures that the information does not propagate faster than allowed by the speed of light.

:p How do you test the Courant condition using different values of \(\Delta z\) and \(\Delta t\)?
??x
To test the Courant condition, we simulate the system with varying time steps (\(\Delta t\)) and spatial steps (\(\Delta z\)). The stability of the solution depends on whether these parameters satisfy the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition:

\[ \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta z} < \frac{1}{c}, \]

where \(c\) is the speed of light in the medium.

For example, in Python, you could implement this by iterating over different values and checking for convergence or stability:

```python
# Example pseudocode for testing Courant condition
for dt in [0.01, 0.02, 0.03]:  # Test multiple time steps
    for dz in [0.05, 0.1, 0.2]:  # Test multiple spatial steps
        if (dt / dz) < 1/c:
            stable_solution = simulate_wave_field(dt, dz)
        else:
            unstable_solution = simulate_wave_field(dt, dz)
```

#### Pulse Propagation Verification

Background context: The direction of pulse propagation can be verified by checking the initial conditions and how they evolve over time. For linearly polarized waves, the fields \(Ex\) and \(Hy\) should propagate in a specific direction based on their relative phases.

:p How do you verify that pulses propagate both to the right and left with no initial \(H\) field?
??x
To verify this, we set up an initial condition where only \(Ex\) has non-zero values:

```python
# Example pseudocode for setting initial conditions
Ex[0, 0] = cos(t - z / c)  # Initial condition for Ex

Hy[k, 0] = 0  # No initial H field
```

The pulse will propagate to the right because \(Ex\) and \(Hy\) are in phase. To get pulses that also travel to the left, we need to introduce a relative phase difference between \(Ex\) and \(Hy\):

```python
# Example pseudocode for setting initial conditions with relative phases
Ex[0, 0] = cos(t - z / c + phi_x) 
Hy[0, 0] = cos(t - z / c + phi_y)
```

If \(\phi_x - \phi_y = \pi/2\), the pulse will propagate to both directions.

#### Gaussian Pulse Simulation

Background context: Simulating a Gaussian pulse involves setting up initial conditions that mimic a Gaussian function in time. This can be used to study wave propagation with localized energy distributions.

:p How do you modify the program to include an initial \(H\) field and an \(E\) field with Gaussian shapes?
??x
To modify the simulation for a Gaussian pulse, we set both \(Ex\) and \(Hy\) with Gaussian functions:

```python
# Example pseudocode for setting Gaussian pulses
from math import exp

def gaussian(x, x0, sigma):
    return 1 / (sigma * sqrt(2 * pi)) * exp(-(x - x0)**2 / (2 * sigma**2))

Ex[0, 0] = gaussian(t - t0, 0, sigma_t)  
Hy[0, 0] = gaussian(t - t0, 0, sigma_t)
```

Here, \(t_0\) is the center of the pulse in time and \(\sigma_t\) controls the width.

#### Dielectric Material Effects

Background context: Introducing a dielectric material into the simulation can change the propagation behavior due to its refractive index. This can result in both transmission and reflection at the boundaries, depending on the index values.

:p How do you simulate unbounded propagation by using periodic boundary conditions?
??x
To simulate unbounded propagation, we implement periodic boundary conditions that effectively make the domain infinite:

```python
# Example pseudocode for periodic boundary conditions to simulate unbounded space
Ex[k, t] = Ex[(k + 1) % x_max, t]
Hy[k, t] = Hy[(k + 1) % x_max, t]

Ex[k, t] = Ex[(k - 1) % x_max, t]
Hy[k, t] = Hy[(k - 1) % x_max, t]
```

This ensures that the fields at the boundaries wrap around to the opposite end of the domain.

#### Frequency-Dependent Filtering

Background context: By placing a medium with periodic permittivity in the integration volume, we can filter out certain frequencies due to its frequency-dependent behavior. This is useful for studying dispersive media where different frequencies propagate at different speeds.

:p How do you investigate standing waves longer than the size of the integration region?
??x
To investigate standing waves, we set initial conditions corresponding to plane waves with nodes at the boundaries:

```python
# Example pseudocode for setting up standing wave initial conditions
Ex[k, 0] = sin(2 * pi * k / (integration_region_length))  
Hy[k, 0] = -sin(2 * pi * k / (integration_region_length))
```

These initial conditions create a standing wave pattern within the integration region.

#### Wave Plate Simulation

Background context: A wave plate can convert linearly polarized waves to circularly polarized ones by introducing a relative phase shift between the components of the polarization vector. This is often achieved using birefringent materials that cause different propagation velocities in orthogonal directions.

:p How do you simulate a quarter-waveplate and observe its effect on a linearly polarized wave?
??x
To simulate a quarter-wave plate, we start with a linearly polarized wave:

```python
# Example pseudocode for setting initial conditions of a linearly polarized wave
Ex[k, 0] = cos(t - z / c)  
Hy[k, 0] = cos(t - z / c)
```

Upon entering the quarter-wave plate, the relative phase between \(Ex\) and \(Hy\) is shifted by \(\lambda/4\):

```python
# Example pseudocode for applying phase shift in the wave plate
phi_shift = pi / 4

Ex[k, t] += sin(t - z / c + phi_shift)  
Hy[k, t] -= cos(t - z / c + phi_shift)
```

This introduces a circular polarization upon exiting the wave plate.

??x
Maxwell's equations for wave propagation along the z-axis are:
\[
\frac{\partial H_x}{\partial t} = \frac{1}{\mu_0} \frac{\partial E_y}{\partial z}, \quad \frac{\partial H_y}{\partial t} = -\frac{1}{\mu_0} \frac{\partial E_x}{\partial z}
\]
\[
\frac{\partial E_x}{\partial t} = -\frac{1}{\epsilon_0} \frac{\partial H_y}{\partial z}, \quad \frac{\partial E_y}{\partial t} = \frac{1}{\epsilon_0} \frac{\partial H_x}{\partial z}
\]
These equations describe the interdependencies of electric and magnetic fields in EM wave propagation.

Background context: The Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) approach is used to solve the wave equations. A simplified set of equations with a beta value is provided, ensuring symmetry and stability.

:p What are the equations derived from the FDTD approach in this context?
??x
The FDTD algorithm leads to the following symmetric equations:
\[
E_{k,n+1}^{x} = E_{k,n}^{x} + \beta(H_{k+1,n}^{y} - H_{k,n}^{y})
\]
\[
E_{k,n+1}^{y} = E_{k,n}^{y} + \beta(H_{k+1,n}^{x} - H_{k,n}^{x})
\]
\[
H_{k,n+1}^{x} = H_{k,n}^{x} + \beta(E_{k+1,n}^{y} - E_{k,n}^{y})
\]
\[
H_{k,n+1}^{y} = H_{k,n}^{y} + \beta(E_{k+1,n}^{x} - E_{k,n}^{x})
\]
Here, \( \beta \) is a small value used to ensure stability and symmetry in the solution.

#### Twin Lead Transmission Line Model
Background context: The model describes a twin-lead transmission line with two parallel wires carrying alternating current or pulses. It includes components like inductance (LΔx), resistance (RΔx), capacitance (CΔx), and conductance (GΔx).

:p What are the equations describing the voltage and current for a segment of the twin lead transmission line?
??x
The telegrapher's equations describe the voltage and current for a segment of the twin-lead transmission line:
\[
\frac{\partial V(x,t)}{\partial x} = -R I(x,t) - L \frac{\partial I(x,t)}{\partial t}
\]
\[
\frac{\partial I(x,t)}{\partial x} = -G V(x,t) - C \frac{\partial V(x,t)}{\partial t}
\]
For lossless transmission lines (R = G = 0), these equations simplify to:
\[
\frac{\partial V(x,t)}{\partial x} = -L \frac{\partial I(x,t)}{\partial t}, \quad \frac{\partial I(x,t)}{\partial x} = -C \frac{\partial V(x,t)}{\partial t}
\]
Differentiating and substituting leads to the familiar 1D wave equation.

Background context: The leapfrog algorithm is applied to solve the telegrapher's equations, ensuring stability by considering the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition.

:p What is the CFL condition in this context?
??x
The CFL condition ensures numerical stability when using the leapfrog algorithm. For the given equations, it states:
\[
\frac{c \Delta t}{\Delta x} \leq 1
\]
Where \( c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}} \), ensuring that the time step \( \Delta t \) is appropriately chosen to maintain stability.

#### Experimenting with Different Values for Δx and Δt
Background context: The problem involves experimenting to find better precision or speedup in computations. This is often achieved by adjusting the spatial step size (Δx) and temporal step size (Δt). For finite difference methods, smaller values of Δx and Δt can improve accuracy but may also increase computational cost.

:p What are the key factors to consider when choosing Δx and Δt for numerical simulations?
??x
When selecting Δx and Δt, the primary considerations include ensuring stability and accuracy. The Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition often provides a guideline that must be met: \( \Delta t < \frac{c \cdot \Delta x}{L} \), where \( c \) is the wave speed or propagation constant, and \( L \) is the length of the transmission line. Smaller Δx and Δt can improve accuracy but may require more computational resources.

For stability, one must ensure that the numerical scheme remains stable under the chosen step sizes. This involves checking conditions such as those derived from Von Neumann analysis for specific problems like wave equations or Schrödinger's equation.

Example code snippet:
```python
# Pseudocode to adjust Δx and Δt

#### Boundary Conditions V(0,t) = V(L,t) = 0
Background context: The boundary conditions specify the values of the wave function at the ends of the transmission line. These conditions are essential for solving partial differential equations accurately.

:p What do the given boundary conditions (V(0,t) = V(L,t) = 0) imply?
??x
The boundary conditions \( V(0, t) = V(L, t) = 0 \) imply that at both ends of the transmission line (at positions 0 and L), the wave function is zero for any time \( t \). This represents an idealized scenario where the ends of the line are clamped or grounded. These conditions ensure that no voltage can exist at these points, which is typical in scenarios like electronic circuits with short-circuited lines.

Example code snippet:
```python
# Applying boundary conditions
if x == 0 or x == L:
    V[x, t] = 0
```

#### FDTD Algorithm for 1D Wave Propagation
This section describes a Finite-Difference Time Domain (FDTD) algorithm implementation to solve Maxwell’s equations in one dimension. The simulation is visualized using the VPython library, which helps in plotting electric and magnetic fields over time.

The code initializes arrays for electric field `Ex` and magnetic field `Hy`, sets up plots for these fields, and defines boundary conditions. Time evolution of fields is computed iteratively using finite difference schemes.

#### Boundary Conditions in FDTD Simulation
The code implements periodic boundary conditions to handle the edges of the computational domain. These ensure that the fields wrap around from one end of the simulation box to the other, simulating an infinite domain.

:p What are the periodic boundary conditions applied for?
??x
Periodic boundary conditions are applied at the boundaries of the computational domain to simulate an infinite or large enough space where reflections do not significantly affect the solution. This ensures that field values at one end of the simulation box are treated as if they continue from the other end.

Code example (pseudocode):
```python
# Periodic BC: x=0 and x=L
Ex[0] = Ex[-1]
Hy[0] = Hy[-1]

Ex[-1] = Ex[0]
Hy[-1] = Hy[0]
```

#### Time Evolution of Fields
The time evolution of the fields is computed iteratively by updating their values based on neighboring cells' fields from previous time steps. This process involves finite difference schemes to approximate spatial derivatives.

:p How are field values updated in each iteration?
??x
Field values are updated using finite difference schemes, which approximate spatial derivatives with differences between nearby cell values. For example, the change in `Ex` at a given point is estimated as the difference in neighboring cells' `Hy` fields scaled by a factor `beta`.

Code example (pseudocode):
```python
def update_fields(ti):
    for i in range(1, len(Ex) - 1):  # Exclude boundaries for now
        Ex[i] = Ex[i] + beta * (Hy[i-1] - Hy[i+1])
    
    for i in range(1, len(Hy) - 1):
        Hy[i] = Hy[i] + beta * (Ex[i-1] - Ex[i+1])

# Inside main loop:
update_fields(ti)
```

#### Circularly Polarized Wave Simulation
The code simulates the propagation of circularly polarized waves in the z-direction using FDTD. It updates the fields with complex phase shifts to represent the rotation of polarization.

:p What is unique about the circularly polarized wave simulation?
??x
The circularly polarized wave simulation uses a more complex phase shift mechanism compared to linearly polarized waves. The fields are updated with additional terms that introduce a time-dependent phase factor, representing the rotating nature of circular polarization.

Code example (pseudocode):
```python
def update_fields(ti):
    for k in range(101, 202):  # Update specific region
        Ex[101:202, ti] = 0.1 * cos(-2*pi*k/100 - 0.005*pi*(k-101) + 2*pi*j/4996)
        Hy[101:202, ti] = 0.1 * cos(-2*pi*k/100 - 0.005*pi*(k-101) + 2*pi*j/4996)

# Inside main loop:
update_fields(ti)
```

#### Importing Required Libraries
Background context: The provided script imports necessary libraries to create visual representations of electric and magnetic fields for circular polarization using finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods.

:p What is the purpose of importing `*` from `visual` at the beginning of the code?

??x
The import statement `from visual import *` is used to access all functions and objects in the `visual` module without needing to prefix them with `visual.`. This makes it easier to work with visualization tools provided by the `visual` library, which is typically part of the VPython package.

```python
# Example of using a function from visual
scene = display(x=0,y=0,width=600,height=400, range=200, title='Circular Polarized E (white) & H (yellow) Fields')
```

#### Plotting Fields
Background context: The `plotfields` function updates the visual arrows based on the current values of electric and magnetic fields.

:p What does the `plotfields` function do?

??x
The `plotfields` function updates the visualization by setting the axis of each arrow to represent the corresponding field. It uses the current values of the electric (`Ex`, `Ey`) and magnetic (`Hx`, `Hy`) fields to set the direction of the arrows.

```python
def plotfields(Ex,Ey,Hx,Hy):
    for n, arr in enumerate(Earrows):
        arr.axis = (35 * Ey[10 * n, 1], 0, 35 * Ex[10 * n, 1])
    
    for n, arr in enumerate(Harrows):
        arr.axis = (35 * Hy[10 * n, 1], 0, 35 * Hx[10 * n, 1])
```

#### Time Stepping and Field Updates
Background context: The `newfields` function performs time stepping to update the electric and magnetic fields.

:p What does the `newfields` function do?

??x
The `newfields` function updates the electric (`Ex`, `Ey`) and magnetic (`Hx`, `Hy`) fields using a finite-difference scheme. It applies boundary conditions (periodic in this case) to ensure the wave continues without reflecting.

```python
def newfields():
    while True:
        # Time stepping rate(1000)
        Ex[1:max - 1, 1] = Ex[1: max - 1, 0] + c * (Hy[:max - 2, 0] - Hy[2:max, 0])
        
        Ey[1:max - 1, 1] = Ey[1: max - 1, 0] + c * (Hx[2:max, 0] - Hx[:max - 2, 0])
        
        Hx[1:max - 1, 1] = Hx[1: max - 1, 0] + c * (Ey[2:max, 0] - Ey[:max - 2, 0])
        
        Hy[1:max - 1, 1] = Hy[1: max - 1, 0] + c * (Ex[:max - 2, 0] - Ex[2:max, 0])
        
        Ex[0, 1] = Ex[0, 0] + c * (Hy[200 - 1, 0] - Hy[1, 0]) # Periodic BC
        Ex[200, 1] = Ex[200, 0] + c * (Hy[200 - 1, 0] - Hy[1, 0])
        
        Ey[0, 1] = Ey[0, 0] + c * (Hx[1, 0] - Hx[200 - 1, 0])
        Ey[200, 1] = Ey[200, 0] + c * (Hx[1, 0] - Hx[200 - 1, 0])

        Hx[0, 1] = Hx[0, 0] + c * (Ey[1, 0] - Ey[200 - 1, 0])
        Hx[200, 1] = Hx[200, 0] + c * (Ey[1, 0] - Ey[200 - 1, 0])

        Hy[0, 1] = Hy[0, 0] + c * (Ex[200 - 1, 0] - Ex[1, 0])
        Hy[200, 1] = Hy[200, 0] + c * (Ex[200 - 1, 0] - Ex[1, 0])

        plotfields(Ex,Ey,Hx,Hy)
        
        Ex[:max, 0] = Ex[: max, 1]; Ey[: max, 0] = Ey[: max, 1]
        Hx[:max, 0] = Hx[: max, 1]; Hy[: max, 0] = Hy[: max, 1]
```
