#### Pendulum Limit Cycles and Chaotic Motion

In this section, we explore different behaviors of a double pendulum system. The goal is to identify various types of limit cycles (including aperiod-3, running solutions, and chaotic motion) using phase space plots.

:p Identify the three main types of long-term phase space behavior in a double pendulum system.
??x
The three main types of long-term phase space behavior are:
1. Aperiod-3 limit cycle: The pendulum jumps between three major orbits.
2. Running solution: The pendulum keeps going over the top.
3. Chaotic motion: Paths in the phase space are close enough to appear as bands.

These behaviors can be visualized by plotting the position of one pendulum against another, or using a lag plot where \( \theta(t+\tau) \) is plotted against \( \theta(t) \). Here, \( \tau \) is a lag time that should be chosen as some fraction of a characteristic time for the system. 

For example:
```java
public class PendulumSimulation {
    public void generatePhasespacePlot(int initialTheta1, int initialTheta2, double tau) {
        List<Double> theta1 = new ArrayList<>(); // Initial and subsequent positions of pendulum 1
        List<Double> theta2 = new ArrayList<>(); // Initial and subsequent positions of pendulum 2
        
        // Simulate the motion to fill in the lists with appropriate values.
        
        for (int i = 0; i < theta1.size() - tau; i++) {
            System.out.println(theta1.get(i + tau) + " " + theta1.get(i));
            System.out.println(theta2.get(i + tau) + " " + theta2.get(i));
        }
    }
}
```

#### Phase Space Without Velocities

When you measure the displacement of a system as a function of time, you can still generate a phase space plot by plotting \( \theta(t+\tau) \) versus \( \theta(t) \). This approach effectively approximates the velocity using the forward difference formula.

:p Create a phase space plot from chaotic pendulum data by plotting \( \theta(t+\tau) \) against \( \theta(t) \).
??x
To create a phase space plot without explicit velocity data, use the following approach:

```java
public class PhaseSpacePlotter {
    public void generatePhaseSpacePlot(List<Double> thetaValues, double tau) {
        for (int i = 0; i < thetaValues.size() - tau; i++) {
            double currentTheta = thetaValues.get(i);
            double nextTheta = thetaValues.get(i + tau);
            System.out.println(currentTheta + " " + nextTheta);
        }
    }
}
```

This method effectively approximates the velocity as:

\[ v(t) \approx \frac{\theta(t+\tau) - \theta(t)}{\tau} \]

By plotting \( \theta(t+\tau) \) against \( \theta(t) \), you can visualize the phase space dynamics.

#### Bifurcation Diagram for Chaotic Pendulum

Background context: A bifurcation diagram is a graphical tool that shows how the behavior of a dynamical system changes as a parameter varies. In this case, we are looking at a chaotic pendulum with a vibrating pivot point and its response to varying driving forces. The equation governing the system is given by:

\[ \frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} = -\alpha \frac{d\theta}{dt} - (\omega_0^2 + f \cos(\omega t)) \sin(\theta) \]

where \( \alpha \) is the damping coefficient, \( \omega_0 \) is the natural frequency of the pendulum, \( \omega \) is the driving force's angular frequency, and \( f \) is the amplitude of the driving force. The initial conditions are \( \theta(0) = 1 \) and \( \dot{\theta}(0) = 1 \).

To obtain the bifurcation diagram:

1. Set \( \alpha = 0.1 \), \( \omega_0 = 1 \), \( \omega = 2 \).
2. Vary \( f \) from 0 to 2.25.
3. After each value of \( f \), wait for 150 periods of the driver before sampling.
4. Sample \( \dot{\theta} \) at points where \( \dot{\theta} = 0 \) (i.e., when the pendulum passes through its equilibrium position).
5. Plot the absolute values of \( \dot{\theta} \) versus \( f \).

:p How do you generate a bifurcation diagram for a chaotic pendulum with a vibrating pivot?
??x
To generate a bifurcation diagram, follow these steps:

1. Set initial conditions: \( \theta(0) = 1 \) and \( \dot{\theta}(0) = 1 \).
2. Choose parameters: \( \alpha = 0.1 \), \( \omega_0 = 1 \), \( \omega = 2 \).
3. Vary the driving force \( f \) from 0 to 2.25.
4. For each value of \( f \):
   - Allow the system to settle by waiting for 150 periods of the driver.
   - Sample the angular velocity \( \dot{\theta} \) at points where it crosses zero.
5. Plot these sampled values of \( \dot{\theta} \) against \( f \).

This process reveals how the system's behavior changes as the driving force varies, showing the onset and continuation of chaotic behavior.

```java
// Pseudocode for generating bifurcation diagram

public void generateBifurcationDiagram() {
    double alpha = 0.1;
    double omega0 = 1;
    double omega = 2;
    double fStart = 0;
    double fEnd = 2.25;
    int sampleCount = 150;
    
    for (double f = fStart; f <= fEnd; f += 0.01) {
        solvePendulumEquation(alpha, omega0, omega, f); // Solve the pendulum equation
        waitForPeriods(sampleCount * omega / f); // Wait for settling time
        
        List<Double> velocities = sampleAngularVelocities(); // Sample velocities at zero crossings
        
        for (double velocity : velocities) {
            plotPoint(f, Math.abs(velocity)); // Plot points in bifurcation diagram
        }
    }
}

public void solvePendulumEquation(double alpha, double omega0, double omega, double f) {
    // Solve the pendulum equation numerically with given parameters
}

public void waitForPeriods(int periods) {
    // Wait for specified number of driver periods to settle
}

public List<Double> sampleAngularVelocities() {
    // Sample velocities at points where they cross zero
    return new ArrayList<>();
}

public void plotPoint(double f, double velocity) {
    // Plot point (f, |velocity|) in the bifurcation diagram
}
```

#### Chaotic Frequencies in Pendulum

Background context: In a chaotic system like the one described, the behavior is characterized by a series of dominant frequencies that appear sequentially rather than simultaneously. This is different from linear systems where Fourier analysis would show simultaneous occurrence of multiple frequencies.

:p How does the concept of dominant sequential frequencies apply to the chaotic pendulum?
??x
In a chaotic pendulum, the system tends to oscillate between different modes or states rather than exhibiting all possible frequencies at once. Instead, it exhibits a series of dominant frequencies that appear sequentially as the driving force changes.

This behavior is observed in the bifurcation diagram, where the sampled angular velocities \( \dot{\theta} \) are plotted against the driving force \( f \). The diagram shows how the system jumps from one oscillatory mode to another, reflecting the presence of distinct dominant frequencies that the system gets attracted to as it evolves.

```java
// Pseudocode for analyzing chaotic pendulum frequencies

public void analyzeChaoticFrequencies() {
    double alpha = 0.1;
    double omega0 = 1;
    double omega = 2;
    
    List<Double> sampledVelocities = new ArrayList<>();
    for (double f = 0; f <= 2.25; f += 0.01) {
        solvePendulumEquation(alpha, omega0, omega, f); // Solve the pendulum equation
        waitForPeriods(150 * (omega / f)); // Wait for settling time
        
        List<Double> velocities = sampleAngularVelocities(); // Sample velocities at zero crossings
        sampledVelocities.addAll(velocities);
    }
    
    // Perform Fourier analysis on sampled Velocities to identify dominant frequencies
}

public void solvePendulumEquation(double alpha, double omega0, double omega, double f) {
    // Solve the pendulum equation numerically with given parameters
}

public void waitForPeriods(int periods) {
    // Wait for specified number of driver periods to settle
}

public List<Double> sampleAngularVelocities() {
    // Sample velocities at points where they cross zero
    return new ArrayList<>();
}

#### Pendulum Analysis Using Fourier Components
Background context: The behavior of a nonlinear pendulum, driven by external sinusoidal torque, can exhibit complex periodic behaviors. These behaviors include three-cycle and five-cycle structures in phase space. The objective is to analyze these structures using Fourier components.

:p What are the major frequencies contained in one-, three-, and five-cycle structures of a chaotic pendulum?
??x
The major frequencies in these structures can be deduced from the driving frequency \(\omega\) and the natural frequency \(\omega_0\). For a three-cycle structure, you would typically find three Fourier components corresponding to \(3\omega\), \(\omega\), and possibly other harmonics. Similarly, for a five-cycle structure, more complex combinations of frequencies are expected.

To analyze these structures:
1. Dust off your program for analyzing signals into Fourier components.
2. Apply the analysis to solutions where there is one-, three-, or five-cycle behavior in phase space.
3. Wait for transients to die out before conducting the analysis.
4. Compare results with those in Figure 16.6.

Code Example (Pseudocode):
```java
public class PendulumAnalysis {
    public void analyzeFourierComponents(double[] signal) {
        // Implement Fourier component analysis
        double omegaDriver = ...; // Driving frequency
        double omegaNatural = ...; // Natural frequency

        // Calculate Fourier components
        List<Complex> fourierComponents = calculateFourierTransform(signal);
        
        // Filter out major components based on frequencies close to 3*omegaDriver, 5*omegaDriver, etc.
    }
}
```

#### Pendulum Analysis Using Wavelets
Background context: Wavelet analysis is more appropriate for signals that occur over finite periods of time, such as chaotic oscillations. The objective is to compare the Fourier and wavelet analyses of the pendulum's behavior.

:p How can you discern the temporal sequence of various components using wavelets?
??x
Using wavelets allows us to analyze the pendulum’s signal in both time and frequency domains, making it easier to see how different components evolve over time. By plotting the wavelet coefficients, we can observe how energy is distributed across different scales (or time frequencies).

Code Example (Pseudocode):
```java
public class WaveletAnalysis {
    public void analyzeWavelets(double[] signal) {
        // Implement wavelet analysis using a library like MATLAB or Scipy in Python
        double omegaDriver = ...; // Driving frequency
        double omegaNatural = ...; // Natural frequency

        // Perform wavelet transform on the signal
        WaveletCoefficients coefficients = waveletTransform(signal);
        
        // Plot wavelet coefficients to observe temporal sequence of components
    }
}
```

#### Double Pendulum Analysis
Background context: The double pendulum has two coupled motions, making its equations nonlinear and complex. Even without external driving forces, the system can exhibit chaotic behavior due to the coupling between the two pendulums.

:p What are the equations of motion for the double pendulum?
??x
The equations of motion for the double pendulum can be derived from the Lagrangian formulation:
\[ L = \frac{1}{2}(m_1 + m_2)l_1^2\dot{\theta}_1^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_2 l_2^2\dot{\theta}_2^2 + m_2 l_1 l_2 \dot{\theta}_1 \dot{\theta}_2 \cos(\theta_1 - \theta_2) + (m_1 + m_2)g l_1 \cos(\theta_1) + m_2 g l_2 \cos(\theta_2) \]

From this Lagrangian, the equations of motion are:
\[ \ddot{\theta}_1 = -\frac{m_2 l_2}{I_{12}} \sin(\theta_1 - \theta_2) + \frac{g (m_1 + m_2) \cos(\theta_1)}{l_1} \]
\[ \ddot{\theta}_2 = \frac{m_2 l_1}{I_{12}} \sin(\theta_1 - \theta_2) - \frac{g m_2 \cos(\theta_2)}{l_2} \]

Where \( I_{12} = (m_1 + m_2) l_1^2 + m_2 l_2^2 - m_2 l_1 l_2 \cos(\theta_1 - \theta_2) \).

Code Example (Pseudocode):
```java
public class DoublePendulum {
    public void deriveEquations(double m1, double m2, double l1, double l2, double g) {
        // Derive the equations of motion using Lagrangian mechanics
        double I_12 = (m1 + m2) * Math.pow(l1, 2) + m2 * Math.pow(l2, 2) - m2 * l1 * l2 * Math.cos(Math.abs(theta1 - theta2));
        double eq1 = -m2 * l2 / I_12 * Math.sin(theta1 - theta2) + g * (m1 + m2) * Math.cos(theta1);
        double eq2 = m2 * l1 / I_12 * Math.sin(theta1 - theta2) - g * m2 * Math.cos(theta2);

        // Print or return the equations
    }
}
```

#### Chaotic Billiards Analysis
Background context: Chaotic billiards involve a particle moving freely in a straight line until it hits a boundary wall, which causes specular reflection. The objective is to explore the behavior of four types of billiard systems (square, circular, Sinai, and stadium).

:p How can you compute trajectories for these different types of billiards?
??x
To compute trajectories for the given billiard systems:
1. Define the geometry of each type of billiard.
2. Use initial conditions to track the particle’s path as it bounces off the walls.

For example, in a square billiard (Figure 16.12a and 16.12c), the particle will follow straight lines until it hits one of the four walls. Upon hitting a wall, the particle reflects according to the law of reflection: \(\theta_i = \theta_r\).

Code Example (Pseudocode):
```java
public class BilliardTrajectories {
    public void computeSquareBilliardTrajectory(double initialX, double initialY) {
        // Define square billiard boundaries
        double width = 1.0;
        double height = 1.0;
        
        // Initial conditions
        double x = initialX;
        double y = initialY;
        
        // Compute trajectory
        while (true) {
            if (x < -width / 2 || x > width / 2) {
                // Reflect horizontally
                x = -x;
            } else if (y < -height / 2 || y > height / 2) {
                // Reflect vertically
                y = -y;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
