#### Floating-Point Representation
Floating-point numbers represent real numbers as a binary version of scientific or engineering notation. They consist of a sign bit, an exponent, and a mantissa.

:p What are the components of floating-point representation?
??x
The components of floating-point representation include:
1. Sign Bit: Indicates whether the number is positive or negative.
2. Exponent: Determines the scale of the number.
3. Mantissa (or significand): Contains the significant digits of the number.
```java
// Example in Java
float value = 2.99792458e8f; // Speed of light in m/s
```

#### Floating-Point Error Analysis
Floating-point errors occur due to the finite number of bits used to store numbers. Small numbers can have large relative errors because many leading zeros in the mantissa reduce precision.

:p Why do small floating-point numbers often have larger relative errors?
??x
Small floating-point numbers often have larger relative errors because their binary representation has a significant number of leading zeros in the mantissa, reducing the overall precision. The absolute error remains constant, but the relative error increases as the magnitude of the number decreases.
```java
// Example in Java
float smallNumber = 0.001f; // May have large relative errors due to fewer significant bits
```

#### Floating-Point Number Representation Basics
Background context: The IEEE 754 standard defines how floating-point numbers are represented and stored. This standard ensures consistency across different computing platforms but may vary among manufacturers.

:p What is the significance of the IEEE 754 standard for floating-point arithmetic?
??x
The IEEE 754 standard provides a consistent way to represent and manipulate floating-point numbers, ensuring reproducibility across different computers. It defines specific formats for single and double precision numbers, including how signs, exponents, and mantissas are stored.

```java
public class FloatRepresentation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example showing how a float number is represented in memory
        float x = 3.14f;
        // Internally, the value of 'x' would be stored as:
        byte sign = (byte)(0); // Sign bit for positive
        int exponent = (int)((Math.log(Math.abs(x)) / Math.log(2)) + 127);
        int mantissa = Float.floatToIntBits(x) & 0x7FFFFF; // Fraction part

        System.out.println("Sign: " + sign);
        System.out.println("Exponent: " + exponent);
        System.out.println("Mantissa: " + mantissa);
    }
}
```
