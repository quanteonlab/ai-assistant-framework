#### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
Background context: TDD is a software development approach where tests are written before the actual implementation of a feature. The goal is to ensure that each new piece of code meets its intended purpose through automated testing, promoting robust and reliable code.

:p What is TDD?
??x
Test-Driven Development (TDD) is an iterative process where developers write a test case for new functionality before implementing it. This ensures that the next step in development will add value.

#### Using Mocking Packages
Background context: Mocking packages are used to create fake or mock objects to simulate real dependencies during testing, especially when dealing with complex classes. This helps isolate units of code and ensure tests are more reliable.

:p What is a mocking package used for?
??x
A mocking package creates fake or mock objects that can be used in unit tests to simulate the behavior of real dependencies. This is particularly useful when dependencies cannot be easily controlled or faked, such as database interactions.

#### Verifying Method Calls
Background context: Verifying that a method was called during test execution is crucial for ensuring that the code behaves as expected. Moq provides a way to track such calls.

:p How do you verify that a method was called using Moq?
??x
You can use the `Verify` method to ensure that a specific method has been called:
```csharp
mock.VerifyGet(m => m.Products, Times.Once);
```
This line checks if the `Products` property was accessed exactly once during test execution.

#### Testing with Mock Data
Background context: When using mock data in tests, it's important to compare actual and expected results accurately. Moq provides a way to return predefined data and compare it effectively.

:p How do you assert that the model returned by the controller matches the test data?
??x
You can use `Assert.Equal` with a custom comparer to verify that the model returned by the controller matches the test data:
```csharp
Assert.Equal(testData, model,
             Comparer.Get<Product>((p1, p2) => 
                   p1?.Name == p2?.Name && p1?.Price == p2?.Price));
```
This ensures that both `Name` and `Price` properties are correctly matched.

#### Unit Testing Overview
Background context: This section explains how unit tests are typically organized and executed within an application. It highlights the benefits of using a dedicated project for unit testing, as well as the importance of isolating components to ensure that each part can be tested independently.

:p What is the typical structure of unit tests mentioned in this text?
??x
The typical structure involves defining unit tests within a separate and dedicated unit test project. This setup helps maintain and extend the codebase more effectively by providing robust support for unit testing.

#### Arrange/Act/Assert Pattern
Background context: The Arrange/Act/Assert pattern is a common structure used in writing unit tests to ensure that each part of the system under test (SUT) is isolated and tested independently. This pattern helps in organizing the test by preparing the test environment, executing the code, and validating the results.

:p What are the three steps involved in the Arrange/Act/Assert pattern for a unit test?
??x
The three steps in the Arrange/Act/Assert pattern are:
1. **Arrange**: Set up the initial state or context of the system.
2. **Act**: Perform an action on the system, such as calling a method.
3. **Assert**: Check that the result of the action meets expectations.

Example code for this pattern might look like:

```csharp
[Test]
public void ExampleTestMethod()
{
    // Arrange: Set up test data and objects
    var mockObject = new Mock<MockClass>();
    
    // Act: Perform an action with the setup object
    var result = mockObject.Object.MethodToTest();
    
    // Assert: Validate the outcome of the method call
    Assert.AreEqual(expectedResult, result);
}
```

#### ASP.NET Core Application Overview
Background context: This chapter introduces the creation of a more realistic e-commerce application called SportsStore. The application will include features such as an online product catalog, shopping cart, checkout process, and administrative area for managing products.

:p What is the primary goal of building the SportsStore application?
??x
The primary goal of building the SportsStore application is to provide a realistic example of real ASP.NET Core development by creating a simplified but functional e-commerce platform. This includes features like an online product catalog, shopping cart, checkout process, and administrative area for managing products.

#### Unit Testing in SportsStore Application
Background context: Throughout the development of the SportsStore application, various unit tests will be created to isolate and test different components of the ASP.NET Core framework. These tests help ensure that each part of the system works as expected without relying on external dependencies.

:p What is the main purpose of including sections on unit testing in the SportsStore application?
??x
The main purpose of including sections on unit testing in the SportsStore application is to demonstrate how different components can be isolated and tested effectively. This approach ensures that the ASP.NET Core framework's features are used correctly and that the overall system behaves as intended.

#### Minimal ASP.NET Core Project Setup
Background context: The setup involves creating a minimal ASP.NET Core project with specific template and framework configurations using dotnet CLI commands. These commands ensure that the project is set up correctly for development.

:p What command is used to create a new web project in .NET 7?
??x
The command used to create a new web project in .NET 7 is:

```powershell
dotnet new web --no-https --output SportsSln/SportsStore --framework net7.0
```

This command creates a new ASP.NET Core web application project with the specified framework version and outputs it into the `SportsSln/SportsStore` folder.

#### Creating a Unit Test Project
Background context: The process of creating a unit test project for an application involves setting up a new project using a testing framework like xUnit. This ensures that individual units or components of the code can be tested independently.

:p How do you create a unit test project in .NET using xUnit?
??x
To create a unit test project, use the `dotnet new` command with the xUnit template.
```sh
dotnet new xunit -o SportsSln/SportsStore.Tests --framework net7.0
```
This command creates a new folder and adds the necessary files for testing.

You then add this project to your solution:
```sh
dotnet sln SportsSln add SportsSln/SportsStore.Tests
```
And reference it in your application project:
```sh
dotnet add SportsSln/SportsStore.Tests reference SportsSln/SportsStore
```

#### Preparing Services and Request Pipeline
Background context: The `Program.cs` file is where you configure services and middleware for an ASP.NET Core application. This includes setting up dependency injection, routing, and serving static files.

:p How do you configure the basic features of an ASP.NET Core application in the Program.cs file?
??x
In the `Program.cs` file, use the following configuration:
```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddControllersWithViews(); // Sets up MVC services

var app = builder.Build();

app.UseStaticFiles(); // Enables serving static files from wwwroot

app.MapDefaultControllerRoute(); // Maps default routes to controllers

app.Run(); // Starts the application
```
This code sets up the basic features needed for an ASP.NET Core web application.

#### Configuring the Razor View Engine
Background context: The Razor view engine processes .cshtml files to generate HTML responses. Proper configuration of this engine ensures that views are easier to create and maintain.

:p How do you configure the Razor view engine in your ASP.NET Core project?
??x
To configure the Razor view engine, add `_ViewImports.cshtml` and `_ViewStart.cshtml` files:
- `_ViewImports.cshtml`: Contains `@using` statements for namespaces.
```cshtml
@using SportsStore.Models @addTagHelper *, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers
```
- `_ViewStart.cshtml`: Sets the default layout file.
```cshtml
@{ Layout = "_Layout"; }
```
Also, create a layout file in `Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml` with HTML structure and placeholders for rendering content:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
    <title>SportsStore</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div>
        @RenderBody()
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```
