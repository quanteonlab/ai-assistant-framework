#### ASP.NET Core Overview
Background context: The text provides an overview of ASP.NET Core as a framework for creating web applications. It mentions that ASP.NET Core has evolved over time with different frameworks like MVC, Razor Pages, and Blazor.

:p What is ASP.NET Core?
??x
ASP.NET Core is a cross-platform framework designed to create web applications. It forms the basis for various application frameworks such as the original MVC framework, which is powerful but requires more setup time. The Razor Pages framework is a newer addition that needs less initial preparation and can be easier to use in simpler projects.

Blazor is another framework allowing client-side applications to be developed using C# instead of JavaScript. It has two versions: one running within an ASP.NET Core server, and the other entirely within the browser.

#### Differences Between MVC and Razor Pages
Background context: The text contrasts the MVC framework with the newer Razor Pages framework. The MVC framework is older and more complex but offers greater flexibility.

:p What are some differences between the original ASP.NET Core framework (MVC) and the Razor Pages framework?
??x
The original ASP.NET Core framework, known as MVC (Model-View-Controller), is a powerful and flexible framework that requires substantial setup time. It provides a clear separation of concerns among the model, view, and controller components.

In contrast, the Razor Pages framework is more recent and generally requires less initial preparation. However, it can be more challenging to manage in complex projects due to its structure.

Both frameworks serve different needs depending on the complexity of the application.

#### Blazor Framework Overview
Background context: The text introduces Blazor as a framework for writing client-side applications using C# instead of JavaScript. It mentions two versions of Blazor, one running within an ASP.NET Core server and another executing entirely in the browser.

:p What is Blazor?
??x
Blazor is a framework that enables the development of client-side web applications using C#. There are two versions of Blazor: one that runs within the ASP.NET Core server and another that executes completely within the browser. This allows developers to use C# for both server-side and client-side logic, providing flexibility in web application development.
