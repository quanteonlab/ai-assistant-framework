#### Getting Data from an Action Method
Background context explaining how action methods can return different types of results, and how to handle them. The example uses `ViewResult` which is a common result type returned by ASP.NET Core MVC actions.

:p How do you retrieve data from an action method that returns a `ViewResult` in ASP.NET Core MVC?
??x
To retrieve data from an action method that returns a `ViewResult`, you need to cast the `ViewData.Model` property of the `ViewResult`. The following code snippet demonstrates how to achieve this:

```csharp
// Act
IEnumerable<Product>? result = 
    (controller.Index() as ViewResult)?.ViewData.Model 
    as IEnumerable<Product>;

// Assert
Product[] prodArray = result?.ToArray() ?? Array.Empty<Product>();
Assert.True(prodArray.Length == 2);
Assert.Equal("P1", prodArray[0].Name);
Assert.Equal("P2", prodArray[1].Name);
```

In this example, the `controller.Index()` method is expected to return a `ViewResult` which contains a model of type `IEnumerable<Product>`. The cast and null-check are necessary because the result can potentially be null.

#### Using Product Data in the View
Background context explaining how action methods pass data (ViewModel) to views, specifically using Razor syntax. The example demonstrates retrieving an `IQueryable<Product>` from the repository.

:p How do you use product data within a Razor view file?
??x
To use product data within a Razor view file, you specify the model type at the top of your `.cshtml` file and then iterate over the collection using an `@foreach` loop. The following code snippet shows how to implement this:

```csharp
@model IQueryable<Product>

@foreach (var p in Model ?? Enumerable.Empty<Product>()) {
    <div>
        <h3>@p.Name</h3>
        @p.Description
        <h4>@p.Price.ToString("c")</h4>
    </div>
}
```

In this example, the `@model` directive specifies that the view expects an `IQueryable<Product>` as its model. The `@foreach` loop iterates over each product and generates HTML content for display. The null-coalescing operator (`??`) ensures that if the model is empty or null, an empty enumerable is used to avoid runtime errors.

#### Handling Nullable Model Data in Razor Views
Background context explaining the behavior of `@model` in Razor views, which always treats model data as nullable even when a non-nullable type is specified.

:p Why does the @model expression treat its value as nullable in Razor views?
??x
The `@model` directive in Razor views can return null, regardless of the actual type. This behavior is necessary because there are scenarios where a view might not receive any data (e.g., when a route constraint fails). The following example demonstrates how to handle this situation:

```csharp
@model IQueryable<Product>

@foreach (var p in Model ?? Enumerable.Empty<Product>()) {
    <div>
        <h3>@p.Name</h3>
        @p.Description
        <h4>@p.Price.ToString("c")</h4>
    </div>
}
```

Here, the null-coalescing operator (`??`) is used to ensure that if `Model` is null or empty, a fallback enumerable (in this case, an empty product collection) is used. This prevents runtime errors and ensures consistent behavior.

#### Adding Pagination to the Product List View
Background context: The application currently displays all products on a single page, which can be overwhelming for users. Implementing pagination allows breaking down the product list into smaller, manageable pages, enhancing user experience and performance.

The `Index` method in the `HomeController` now accepts an optional parameter to control pagination:
```csharp
public ViewResult Index(int productPage = 1)
    => View(repository.Products
        .OrderBy(p => p.ProductID)
        .Skip((productPage - 1) * PageSize)
        .Take(PageSize));
```
- **productPage**: The page number being requested. By default, it is set to `1`.
- **PageSize**: Number of products per page, set to 4 in this case.

:p How does the `Index` method handle pagination?
??x
The `Index` method uses LINQ to OrderBy product IDs and then skips a certain number of products before taking the specified `PageSize`. This allows it to display a subset of the total products based on the requested page.
```csharp
public ViewResult Index(int productPage = 1)
{
    return View(repository.Products
        .OrderBy(p => p.ProductID) // Orders products by ID
        .Skip((productPage - 1) * PageSize) // Skips (page-1)*PageSize items
        .Take(PageSize)); // Takes the next PageSize items
}
```

#### Mock Setup for Testing Pagination
Background context explaining how mock setups are used to test functionalities. The provided example uses Moq to return a predefined set of `Product` objects and verify that the correct products are returned when paginating through them.

:p What is the purpose of the setup in the provided code snippet?
??x
The purpose of the setup is to define what data the mock will provide when the `Products` property is accessed. In this case, it returns an array of predefined `Product` objects that can be used to test pagination logic without needing a real database or service.

```csharp
mock.Setup(m => m.Products).Returns((new Product[] {
    new Product {ProductID = 1, Name = "P1"},
    new Product {ProductID = 2, Name = "P2"},
    new Product {ProductID = 3, Name = "P3"},
    new Product {ProductID = 4, Name = "P4"},
    new Product {ProductID = 5, Name = "P5"}
}).AsQueryable<Product>());
```

#### Page Links in Paging
Explanation on how to implement and display page links for better user navigation. The objective is to allow users to navigate through pages of products using a more intuitive interface.

:p How can you add page links for pagination in the view?
??x
To add page links, we need to create a tag helper that generates HTML markup for the navigation links. This involves creating a view model class `PagingInfo` to pass information about the total items, items per page, and current page to the view.

```csharp
namespace SportsStore.Models.ViewModels {
    public class PagingInfo {
        public int TotalItems { get; set; }
        public int ItemsPerPage { get; set; }
        public int CurrentPage { get; set; }
        public int TotalPages => (int)Math.Ceiling((decimal)TotalItems / ItemsPerPage);
    }
}
```

The tag helper, `PageLinkTagHelper`, will use this view model to generate the necessary HTML for page links.

```csharp
namespace SportsStore.Infrastructure {
    public class PageLinkTagHelper : TagHelper {
        // implementation details go here
    }
}
```

#### Implementation of PagingInfo Class
Explanation and code sample on how to implement the `PagingInfo` view model class.

:p What is the purpose of the `PagingInfo` class in pagination?
??x
The `PagingInfo` class is used to pass information about pagination to the view, such as the total number of items, items per page, and the current page. This helps in dynamically generating links for navigating through pages.

```csharp
namespace SportsStore.Models.ViewModels {
    public class PagingInfo {
        public int TotalItems { get; set; }
        public int ItemsPerPage { get; set; }
        public int CurrentPage { get; set; }
        public int TotalPages => (int)Math.Ceiling((decimal)TotalItems / ItemsPerPage);
    }
}
```

The `TotalPages` property uses a formula to calculate the total number of pages based on the total items and items per page.

```csharp
public int TotalPages => (int)Math.Ceiling((decimal)TotalItems / ItemsPerPage);
```

#### Tag Helpers Overview
Tag helpers are a feature of ASP.NET Core that allow you to introduce C# logic into your views. They are particularly useful for generating HTML content dynamically based on model data and application state. The key idea is to separate presentation logic from business logic, enhancing maintainability and testability.

:p What are tag helpers in ASP.NET Core?
??x
Tag helpers are a feature of ASP.NET Core that allow you to integrate C# code directly into Razor views, enabling dynamic generation of HTML elements based on model data. They help keep view logic separate from business logic, making the application more modular and easier to test.

#### Implementing PageLinkTagHelper
To implement the `PageLinkTagHelper`, you need to define it in a specific namespace and mark it with an attribute specifying which HTML element it can work on.

:p How do you register the `PageLinkTagHelper`?
??x
You register the `PageLinkTagHelper` by adding a statement to the `_ViewImports.cshtml` file within the Views folder. This tells ASP.NET Core where to find the tag helper classes and makes it available for use in views.
```csharp
@addTagHelper *, SportsStore
```

#### Testing Tag Helpers
Testing tag helpers involves creating a test setup where you can provide mocked dependencies and inspect the output generated by the tag helper.

:p How do you unit test `PageLinkTagHelper`?
??x
To unit test `PageLinkTagHelper`, you mock the necessary dependencies such as `IUrlHelperFactory` and use them to create instances of the tag helper. You then call its `Process` method with test data and inspect the output to ensure it generates the correct HTML.
```csharp
[Fact]
public void Can_Generate_Page_Links()
{
    // Arrange
    var urlHelper = new Mock<IUrlHelper>();
    // Setup mock behavior for URL generation
    // Act
    PageLinkTagHelper helper = new PageLinkTagHelper(urlHelper.Object)
    {
        PageModel = new PagingInfo { CurrentPage = 2, TotalItems = 28, ItemsPerPage = 10 },
        ViewContext = viewContext.Object,
        PageAction = "Test"
    };
    TagHelperContext ctx = new TagHelperContext(
        new TagHelperAttributeList(),
        new Dictionary<object, object>(),
        "");
    var content = new Mock<TagHelperContent>();
    TagHelperOutput output = new TagHelperOutput("div",
        new TagHelperAttributeList(),
        (cache, encoder) => Task.FromResult(content.Object));
    helper.Process(ctx, output);
    // Assert
    Assert.Equal(@"<a href=""Test/Page1"">1</a>
<a href=""Test/Page2"">2</a>
<a href=""Test/Page3"">3</a>", 
        output.Content.GetContent());
}
```

#### Creating the ProductsListViewModel Class
Background context: The `ProductsListViewModel` class is created to provide product and pagination information to the view. It uses properties to store these details, making it easier to pass data from the controller to the view.
If applicable, add code examples with explanations:
```csharp
namespace SportsStore.Models.ViewModels {
    public class ProductsListViewModel {
        public IEnumerable<Product> Products { get; set; } = Enumerable.Empty<Product>();
        public PagingInfo PagingInfo { get; set; } = new();
    }
}
```
:p What is the purpose of the `ProductsListViewModel` class?
??x
The `ProductsListViewModel` class is used to pass product data and pagination details from the controller to the view. It encapsulates a collection of products and paging information, making it easier to manage and display paginated data in the view.
```csharp
namespace SportsStore.Models.ViewModels {
    public class ProductsListViewModel {
        public IEnumerable<Product> Products { get; set; } = Enumerable.Empty<Product>();
        public PagingInfo PagingInfo { get; set; } = new();
    }
}
```

#### Updating the Index Action Method in HomeController
Background context: The `Index` action method is updated to use an instance of `ProductsListViewModel` as a model. This allows the controller to provide both product and pagination data to the view.
If applicable, add code examples with explanations:
```csharp
public class HomeController : Controller {
    private IStoreRepository repository;
    public int PageSize = 4;

    public HomeController(IStoreRepository repo) { 
        repository = repo; 
    }

    public ViewResult Index(int productPage = 1) => 
        View(new ProductsListViewModel {
            Products = repository.Products
                .OrderBy(p => p.ProductID)
                .Skip((productPage - 1) * PageSize)
                .Take(PageSize),
            PagingInfo = new PagingInfo {
                CurrentPage = productPage,
                ItemsPerPage = PageSize,
                TotalItems = repository.Products.Count()
            }
        });
}
```
:p How does the `Index` action method update to use `ProductsListViewModel`?
??x
The `Index` action method is updated to create an instance of `ProductsListViewModel`, which contains a collection of products and pagination information. The view data for the model is then set to this `ProductsListViewModel` object, allowing it to pass both product and pagination details to the view.
```csharp
public class HomeController : Controller {
    private IStoreRepository repository;
    public int PageSize = 4;

    public HomeController(IStoreRepository repo) { 
        repository = repo; 
    }

    public ViewResult Index(int productPage = 1) => 
        View(new ProductsListViewModel {
            Products = repository.Products
                .OrderBy(p => p.ProductID)
                .Skip((productPage - 1) * PageSize)
                .Take(PageSize),
            PagingInfo = new PagingInfo {
                CurrentPage = productPage,
                ItemsPerPage = PageSize,
                TotalItems = repository.Products.Count()
            }
        });
}
```

#### Unit Testing the Controller
Background context: A unit test is created to ensure that the controller sends the correct pagination data to the view. This involves setting up a mock repository and verifying that the `ProductsListViewModel` object contains the expected product and pagination information.
If applicable, add code examples with explanations:
```csharp
[Fact]
public void Can_Send_Pagination_View_Model() {
    // Arrange
    Mock<IStoreRepository> mock = new Mock<IStoreRepository>();
    mock.Setup(m => m.Products).Returns((new Product[] { 
        new Product {ProductID = 1, Name = "P1"}, 
        new Product {ProductID = 2, Name = "P2"}, 
        new Product {ProductID = 3, Name = "P3"}, 
        new Product {ProductID = 4, Name = "P4"}, 
        new Product {ProductID = 5, Name = "P5"} 
    }).AsQueryable<Product>());
    
    // Arrange
    HomeController controller = 
        new HomeController(mock.Object) { PageSize = 3 };
    
    // Act
    ProductsListViewModel result = 
        controller.Index(2)?.ViewData.Model as ProductsListViewModel 
        ?? null;
}
```
:p How does the unit test ensure correct pagination data is sent to the view?
??x
The unit test ensures that the `ProductsListViewModel` object contains the expected product and pagination information by setting up a mock repository. It then calls the `Index` action method with page 2, verifies that it returns a non-null `ProductsListViewModel`, and checks that its properties match the expected values.
```csharp
[Fact]
public void Can_Send_Pagination_View_Model() {
    // Arrange
    Mock<IStoreRepository> mock = new Mock<IStoreRepository>();
    mock.Setup(m => m.Products).Returns((new Product[] { 
        new Product {ProductID = 1, Name = "P1"}, 
        new Product {ProductID = 2, Name = "P2"}, 
        new Product {ProductID = 3, Name = "P3"}, 
        new Product {ProductID = 4, Name = "P4"}, 
        new Product {ProductID = 5, Name = "P5"} 
    }).AsQueryable<Product>());
    
    // Arrange
    HomeController controller = 
        new HomeController(mock.Object) { PageSize = 3 };
    
    // Act
    ProductsListViewModel result = 
        controller.Index(2)?.ViewData.Model as ProductsListViewModel 
        ?? null;
}
```

#### Mocking and Testing Setup
Background context: The provided text describes setting up unit tests for a controller action that deals with paginated products. This involves using mocking frameworks to simulate repository behavior and testing different scenarios such as fetching all products or paginating them.

:p How is the `Can_Use_Repository` test setup?
??x
The test sets up a mock repository to return predefined product data, then invokes the controller's Index action with this setup. It asserts that the returned model contains the expected number and names of products.
```csharp
[Fact]
public void Can_Use_Repository()
{
    // Arrange
    Mock<IStoreRepository> mock = new Mock<IStoreRepository>();
    mock.Setup(m => m.Products).Returns((new Product[] { 
        new Product {ProductID = 1, Name = "P1"}, 
        new Product {ProductID = 2, Name = "P2" }
    }).AsQueryable<Product>());
    HomeController controller = new HomeController(mock.Object);

    // Act
    ProductsListViewModel result = 
        controller.Index()?.ViewData.Model as ProductsListViewModel ?? new();
    
    // Assert
    Product[] prodArray = result.Products.ToArray();
    Assert.True(prodArray.Length == 2);
    Assert.Equal("P1", prodArray[0].Name);
    Assert.Equal("P2", prodArray[1].Name);
}
```

#### Paginating Products Test
Background context: The text also describes testing the pagination feature of the product list. This involves setting up a mock repository with more products and then invoking the Index action method with specific page parameters to test pagination logic.

:p How is the `Can_Paginate` test setup?
??x
The test sets up a mock repository with multiple products, configures the controller's page size property, invokes the Index action with a specific page number, and asserts that the returned model contains the correct subset of products.
```csharp
[Fact]
public void Can_Paginate()
{
    // Arrange
    Mock<IStoreRepository> mock = new Mock<IStoreRepository>();
    mock.Setup(m => m.Products).Returns((new Product[] { 
        new Product {ProductID = 1, Name = "P1"}, 
        new Product {ProductID = 2, Name = "P2"}, 
        new Product {ProductID = 3, Name = "P3"}, 
        new Product {ProductID = 4, Name = "P4"}, 
        new Product {ProductID = 5, Name = "P5"} 
    }).AsQueryable<Product>());
    HomeController controller = new HomeController(mock.Object);
    controller.PageSize = 3;

    // Act
    ProductsListViewModel result = 
        controller.Index(2)?.ViewData.Model as ProductsListViewModel ?? new();

    // Assert
    Product[] prodArray = result.Products.ToArray();
    Assert.True(prodArray.Length == 2);
    Assert.Equal("P4", prodArray[0].Name);
    Assert.Equal("P5", prodArray[1].Name);
}
```

#### ViewModel Update for Index Action
Background context: The text mentions updating the view model and the corresponding view to handle paginated product data. This involves changing the `ProductsListViewModel` class and updating the `Index.cshtml` file to display products using this new structure.

:p What changes were made to the `Index.cshtml` file?
??x
The `Index.cshtml` file was updated to use the `ProductsListViewModel` type for its model. The foreach loop was modified to iterate over the `Products` property of the model, and it includes logic to display each product's name, description, and price.
```csharp
@model ProductsListViewModel

@foreach (var p in Model.Products ?? Enumerable.Empty<Product>()) {
    <div>
        <h3>@p.Name</h3>
        @p.Description
        <h4>@p.Price.ToString("c")</h4>
    </div>
}
```
