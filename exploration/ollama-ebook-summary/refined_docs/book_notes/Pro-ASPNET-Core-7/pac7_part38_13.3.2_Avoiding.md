#### Custom Constraints in Routing
Background context: Custom constraints allow developers to define specific conditions for URL routing, which are not covered by built-in constraints. This is useful when standard constraints are insufficient for project requirements.

:p How can you create a custom constraint in ASP.NET Core routing?
??x
To create a custom constraint, you need to implement the `IRouteConstraint` interface and define your logic within the `Match` method. You must also register this custom constraint using the options pattern with an appropriate key.

```csharp
namespace Platform {
    public class CountryRouteConstraint : IRouteConstraint {
        private static string[] countries = { "uk", "france", "monaco" };

        public bool Match(HttpContext? httpContext, IRouter? route,
                          string routeKey, RouteValueDictionary values,
                          RouteDirection routeDirection) {
            string segmentValue = values[routeKey] as string ?? "";
            return Array.IndexOf(countries, segmentValue.ToLower()) > -1;
        }
    }
}
```

#### Ambiguous Route Resolution
Background context: Ambiguity in routing occurs when two or more routes have the same score and cannot be distinguished by the routing system. This can lead to errors if not handled properly.

:p How do you handle ambiguous route scenarios?
??x
To resolve ambiguity, increase specificity by adding literal segments or constraints. Alternatively, you can order routes so that a preferred route is selected over others using `Map` methods.

```csharp
app.Map("{number:int}", async context => {
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("Routed to the int endpoint");
}).Order(1);

app.Map("{number:double}", async context => {
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("Routed to the double endpoint");
}).Order(2);
```

#### Order of Routes
Background context: The order in which routes are defined can influence how requests are routed. By setting the `Order` property, you can prioritize certain routes over others.

:p How does setting route orders help resolve ambiguous routes?
??x
Setting higher or lower values with the `Order` method allows you to control the precedence of routes. Routes with a higher order value take priority if they match the incoming request.

```csharp
app.Map("{number:int}", async context => {
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("Routed to the int endpoint");
}).Order(1);

app.Map("{number:double}", async context => {
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("Routed to the double endpoint");
}).Order(2);
```

#### Breaking Route Ambiguity
Background context explaining how route ambiguity can occur and why it's important to resolve it. Mention that ASP.NET Core uses URL routing, which requires careful handling of overlapping routes.

:p How do you handle ambiguous routes in ASP.NET Core?
??x
To handle ambiguous routes, you need to define route constraints and set the order of execution for different routes. In Listing 13.27, route constraints are added using `Configure(RouteOptions)`, and the `Order` property is used to prioritize one route over another.

```csharp
builder.Services.Configure<RouteOptions>(opts => {
    opts.ConstraintMap.Add("countryName", typeof(CountryRouteConstraint));
});

app.Map("{number:int}", async context => {
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("Routed to the int endpoint");
}).Add(b => ((RouteEndpointBuilder)b).Order = 1);

app.Map("{number:double}", async context => {
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("Routed to the double endpoint");
}).Add(b => ((RouteEndpointBuilder)b).Order = 2);
```

#### Middleware Component for Endpoint Selection
Background context explaining that not all middleware components generate responses, and some are used for features like session handling or response enhancement. Discuss how routing works differently in ASP.NET Core.

:p How does the routing system work in ASP.NET Core?
??x
In ASP.NET Core, routing is set up by calling `UseRouting()` to select routes and `UseEndpoints()` to execute the selected endpoint. Middleware components added between these two methods can inspect which route has been selected before a response is generated, allowing them to modify their behavior accordingly.

```csharp
app.Use(async (context, next) => {
    Endpoint? end = context.GetEndpoint();
    if (end != null) {
        await context.Response.WriteAsync($"{end.DisplayName} Selected");
    } else {
        await context.Response.WriteAsync("No Endpoint Selected");
    }
    await next();
});
```

#### Displaying Endpoint Selection in Middleware
Explanation of using `WithDisplayName` to give routes descriptive names, making it easier for developers to identify selected endpoints. Discuss the use case and benefits.

:p How can you name routes in ASP.NET Core?
??x
You can name routes by using the `WithDisplayName` method when defining a route. This makes it easier to identify which endpoint is being processed by middleware components.

```csharp
app.Map("{number:int}", async context => {
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("Routed to the int endpoint");
}).WithDisplayName("Int Endpoint")
.Add(b => ((RouteEndpointBuilder)b).Order = 1);

app.Map("{number:double}", async context => {
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("Routed to the double endpoint");
}).WithDisplayName("Double Endpoint")
.Add(b => ((RouteEndpointBuilder)b).Order = 2);
```

#### Routes and URL Matching
Routes allow an endpoint to match a request with a specific URL pattern. URL patterns can include variable segments whose values can be captured, optional segments that match when present, and constraints for more precise matching.

:p How do routes help in matching requests with URLs?
??x
Routes facilitate the mapping of HTTP requests to appropriate handlers by defining patterns within the application's routing system. These patterns can contain dynamic segments (variables) which capture specific values from the URL, optional segments that match when present, and constraints for more precise control over what should be matched.

For example:
- A route like `/user/{id}` matches any URL where `{id}` is a variable segment.
- Optional segments could be used in patterns like `/blog/post/{year}/{month}` to capture optional parts of the URL.

:p How do you define constraints for routes?
??x
Constraints are used within routing patterns to apply additional rules or conditions on what should match. For instance, if you want only specific numeric values to be captured by a variable segment, you can use a constraint like `{id:int}` in your route definition.

For example:
```csharp
app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
{
    endpoints.MapGet("/user/{id}", async (int id) => 
        // Handler logic here
    ).WithRoutePattern("user/{id:numeric}");
});
```

#### Dependency Injection Basics
Dependency injection is a design pattern that allows components to access shared services without needing to know which implementation classes are being used. Services are typically used for common tasks such as logging or database interaction.

:p What does dependency injection enable in software development?
??x
Dependency injection enables developers to write more flexible and testable code by decoupling the dependencies of a component from its implementation. This means that components can be easily replaced with other implementations without altering their internal logic, making it simpler to switch behaviors or configurations at runtime.

:p How is dependency injection used in ASP.NET Core?
??x
In ASP.NET Core, `Program.cs` acts as the central configuration file where services are registered and dependencies are resolved. Services can be injected into middleware components, endpoints, and handler functions via constructors or method parameters. The `IServiceProvider` interface can also be used to request services from the service container.

For example:
```csharp
public class Startup {
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) {
        // Registering a service with a specific lifetime
        services.AddTransient<MyService>();
    }
}
```

#### Service Lifecycles in ASP.NET Core
Services can be registered with different lifecycles: transient, scoped, and singleton. Transient services are created every time they are requested, scoped services live for the duration of a request (or lifetime scope), and singleton services have only one instance per application.

:p How do you register a service as a singleton in ASP.NET Core?
??x
To register a service as a singleton in ASP.NET Core, you use the `AddSingleton` method from the `IServiceCollection`.

Example:
```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) {
    // Registering MyService as a singleton
    services.AddSingleton<MyService>();
}
```

:p How do you get a service instance via the context?
??x
To obtain a service instance within an endpoint or middleware, you can use the `HttpContext` object which provides access to the current service provider. You can then request the required service using methods like `GetRequiredService` or `TryGetService`.

Example:
```csharp
public async Task<IActionResult> OnPostAsync() {
    var myService = HttpContext.RequestServices.GetRequiredService<IMyService>();
    // Use the service here...
}
```

#### Managing Service Instantiation
Sometimes, you may need to manage when a class is instantiated, or use a factory method to create instances. ASP.NET Core provides the `ActivatorUtilities` class for this purpose.

:p How do you instantiate a class with constructor dependencies in ASP.NET Core?
??x
To instantiate a class that has constructor dependencies in ASP.NET Core, you can use the `CreateInstance` method from the `ActivatorUtilities` class.

Example:
```csharp
var myClass = ActivatorUtilities.CreateInstance<Program>(services);
// 'myClass' now contains an instance of MyClass with all its dependencies resolved.
```

#### Defining Services for Different Lifecycles
Services can be defined to have different lifecycles: transient (per-request), scoped, and singleton. Understanding these helps in managing the scope and lifetime of services appropriately.

:p How do you define a service as scoped in ASP.NET Core?
??x
To define a service as scoped in ASP.NET Core, use the `AddScoped` method from the `IServiceCollection`.

Example:
```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) {
    // Registering MyService with a scope per request
    services.AddScoped<MyService>();
}
```
