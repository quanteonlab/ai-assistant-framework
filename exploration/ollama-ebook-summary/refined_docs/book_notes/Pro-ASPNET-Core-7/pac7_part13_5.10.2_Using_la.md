#### Lambda Expressions in Action Methods
Background context: In ASP.NET Core development, you often use single-statement action methods that select data and render views. These can be rewritten using lambda expressions for conciseness.

:p How can an action method use a lambda expression?
??x
An action method can use a lambda expression to simplify the logic of selecting data and rendering views. By omitting the `return` keyword and using the `=>` operator, you can write more concise code.
```csharp
// Example of an action method with a lambda expression
public ViewResult Index() => View(Product.GetProducts().Select(p => p?.Name));
```

#### Default Implementations in Interfaces
Background context: C# provides a feature to define default implementations for properties and methods within interfaces. This allows developers to add new features to an interface without breaking existing implementations of that interface.

C/Java does not support this feature; only C# has introduced it as part of its language evolution.

:p What is the purpose of adding default implementations in C#'s interfaces?
??x
The purpose is to allow new features to be added to an interface without requiring all implementing classes to be updated. This can simplify maintenance and reduce the risk of breaking existing codebases when changes are made.

For example, if you need a property like `Names` for some implementations but not others, you can define it as a default implementation in the interface:

```csharp
public interface IProductSelection {
    IEnumerable<Product>? Products { get; }
    IEnumerable<string>? Names => Products?.Select(p => p.Name);
}
```

#### Asynchronous Methods Overview
Asynchronous methods allow background tasks to be performed without blocking the main execution thread, thus improving overall application performance. In ASP.NET Core, asynchronous methods are crucial for handling requests efficiently and making use of multi-core processors.

:p What is the primary purpose of using asynchronous methods in applications like ASP.NET Core?
??x
The primary purpose of using asynchronous methods in applications like ASP.NET Core is to improve overall performance by allowing background tasks to run without blocking the main thread. This means that while some operations are being processed asynchronously, other parts of the application can continue executing, leading to more efficient use of resources and better user experience.

#### Using `async` and `await` Keywords
The introduction of `async` and `await` keywords in C# simplifies working with asynchronous methods, making the code more readable and maintainable.

:p How do `async` and `await` improve the `GetPageLength` method?
??x
The use of `async` and `await` makes the `GetPageLength` method simpler and more readable. Instead of manually handling continuations and using multiple returns, developers can now write asynchronous code that looks like synchronous code.

Here’s how the `GetPageLength` method with `async` and `await` works:

1. The `HttpClient` instance is created.
2. An asynchronous call to `GetAsync` is made, which returns a `Task<HttpResponseMessage>`.
3. The result from `GetAsync` is awaited, allowing the rest of the code to run without blocking.

```csharp
public async static Task<long?> GetPageLength()
{
    HttpClient client = new HttpClient();
    var httpMessage = await client.GetAsync("http://manning.com");
    
    return httpMessage.Content.Headers.ContentLength;
}
```

#### Asynchronous Controller Methods in ASP.NET Core
Asynchronous controller methods in ASP.NET Core use `async` and `await` to improve performance by allowing background operations.

:p How does the asynchronous action method `Index` handle HTTP requests?
??x
The asynchronous action method `Index` handles HTTP requests by making an asynchronous call to retrieve the length of a web page. The result is then used to render a view with appropriate data.

Here’s how it works:

1. A new instance of `MyAsyncMethods.GetPageLength` is awaited, which retrieves the content length asynchronously.
2. The result is passed to the `View` method to render a view with the content length information.

```csharp
public async Task<ViewResult> Index()
{
    long? length = await MyAsyncMethods.GetPageLength();
    return View(new string[] { $"Length: {length}" });
}
```
