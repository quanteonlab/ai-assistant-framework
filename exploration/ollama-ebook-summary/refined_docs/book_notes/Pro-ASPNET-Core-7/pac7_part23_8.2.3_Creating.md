#### Razor Pages Configuration and Layout Setup
Background context: In this section, we explore how to set up Razor Pages for a web application called SportsStore. This involves creating necessary files like `_ViewImports.cshtml`, `_ViewStart.cshtml`, and `_CartLayout.cshtml`. These files help in defining namespaces, adding tag helpers, and setting the default layout for Razor Pages.

:p What is the purpose of the _ViewImports.cshtml file?
??x
The `_ViewImports.cshtml` file is used to add global namespaces that are needed across all Razor views. This includes adding necessary namespaces like `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RazorPages`, which contains the Tag Helpers and other utilities required for building the web application.

```csharp
@namespace SportsStore.Pages
@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RazorPages
@using SportsStore.Models
@using SportsStore.Infrastructure
@addTagHelper *, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers
```

#### Adding Cart Layout
Background context: A layout file is essential for maintaining consistency across multiple Razor Pages. The `_CartLayout.cshtml` file defines the overall structure of pages using this layout.

:p What does the _CartLayout.cshtml file define?
??x
The `_CartLayout.cshtml` file defines a layout template used by Razor Pages in the SportsStore project. This layout includes common elements like the header, navigation, and footer, ensuring that all pages share a consistent look and feel.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
    <title>SportsStore</title>
    <link href="/lib/bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
</head>
<body>
    <div class="bg-dark text-white p-2">
        <span class="navbar-brand ml-2">SPORTS STORE</span>
    </div>
    <div class="m-1 p-1">
        @RenderBody()
    </div>
</body>

#### HTTP Method POST vs. GET
Background context explaining why different HTTP methods are used and their implications on web development. The difference between `POST` and `GET` is significant, especially concerning state changes.

:p What does the use of the `post` method attribute in a form element mean?
??x
Using the `post` method attribute means that the browser will submit the form data to the server using an HTTP POST request. This is suitable for operations that may change state on the server, such as adding a product to a shopping cart or creating a new record.

In contrast, the `GET` method is used for retrieving information and should not result in any changes to the server's state because GET requests are required to be idempotent, meaning they must have no side effects. Attempting to use `GET` for operations like adding products to a cart can lead to unintended consequences or errors.

```html
<form action="/add-to-cart" method="post">
  <input type="hidden" name="product_id" value="123">
  <button type="submit">Add to Cart</button>
</form>
```

#### Enabling Sessions in ASP.NET Core
Explanation on why session state is used and the benefits/drawbacks of different storage methods. The example uses an in-memory approach, which simplifies implementation but can lose data when the application restarts.

:p How does enabling sessions in an ASP.NET Core application involve modifying `Program.cs`?
??x
Enabling sessions requires adding services and middleware to register session handling capabilities within your ASP.NET Core application. In `Program.cs`, this involves calling methods such as `AddDistributedMemoryCache()` and `AddSession()`. Additionally, you must use the `UseSession()` method to enable session support in the pipeline.

Here is how it looks in code:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddDistributedMemoryCache();
builder.Services.AddSession(); // Registers services used for session management

var app = builder.Build();

app.UseStaticFiles();
app.UseSession(); // Enables sessions and associates them with requests from clients.
```

#### Implementing the Cart Feature in SportsStore
Explanation of how to define a cart model, including its purpose and methods. The `Cart` class uses `CartLine` objects to represent each product in the cart.

:p How is the `AddItem` method implemented in the `Cart` class?
??x
The `AddItem` method adds or updates an item in the shopping cart based on the provided product and quantity. It first checks if a matching `CartLine` already exists, then either adds a new line or increments the existing one's quantity.

```csharp
public void AddItem(Product product, int quantity)
{
    CartLine? line = Lines.Where(p => p.Product.ProductID == product.ProductID).FirstOrDefault();
    if (line == null)
    {
        Lines.Add(new CartLine { Product = product, Quantity = quantity });
    }
    else
    {
        line.Quantity += quantity;
    }
}
```

This method ensures that the cart state is updated correctly and efficiently.

#### Calculating Cart Total Value
Explanation of how to compute the total value of items in a shopping cart. The `ComputeTotalValue` method iterates over each line and calculates the sum of products' prices multiplied by their quantities.

:p How does the `ComputeTotalValue` method work?
??x
The `ComputeTotalValue` method computes the total cost of all items in the cart by iterating through each `CartLine`, multiplying the product's price by its quantity, and summing these values.

```csharp
public decimal ComputeTotalValue()
{
    return Lines.Sum(e => e.Product.Price * e.Quantity);
}
```

This method provides an accurate total that can be displayed to users or used for further processing such as placing an order.

#### Adding New Lines to Cart
Background context: The `Cart` class is responsible for managing items that a user adds to their shopping cart. When an item is added, if it's the first time the product has been added, a new `CartLine` should be created. If not, the quantity of the existing `CartLine` should be incremented.
:p How can you test adding a new line to the cart?
??x
You can write a unit test that adds an item to the cart for the first time and verifies that a new `CartLine` is added.

```csharp
[Fact]
public void Can_Add_New_Lines()
{
    // Arrange - create some test products
    Product p1 = new Product { ProductID = 1, Name = "P1" };
    Product p2 = new Product { ProductID = 2, Name = "P2" };

    // Arrange - create a new cart
    Cart target = new Cart();

    // Act
    target.AddItem(p1, 1);
    target.AddItem(p2, 1);

    CartLine[] results = target.Lines.ToArray();

    // Assert
    Assert.Equal(2, results.Length);
    Assert.Equal(p1, results[0].Product);
    Assert.Equal(p2, results[1].Product);
}
```

#### Adding Quantity for Existing Lines
Background context: The `Cart` class should handle adding more of the same product to an existing line. Instead of creating a new `CartLine`, it should increment the quantity of the corresponding `CartLine`.
:p How can you test adding quantity for existing lines in the cart?
??x
You can write a unit test that adds multiple items, including some duplicates, and verifies that only one `CartLine` is created with the correct total quantity.

```csharp
[Fact]
public void Can_Add_Quantity_For_Existing_Lines()
{
    // Arrange - create some test products
    Product p1 = new Product { ProductID = 1, Name = "P1" };
    Product p2 = new Product { ProductID = 2, Name = "P2" };

    // Arrange - create a new cart
    Cart target = new Cart();

    // Act
    target.AddItem(p1, 1);
    target.AddItem(p2, 1);
    target.AddItem(p1, 10);

    CartLine[] results = (target.Lines ?? new()).OrderBy(c => c.Product.ProductID).ToArray();

    // Assert
    Assert.Equal(2, results.Length);
    Assert.Equal(11, results[0].Quantity);
    Assert.Equal(1, results[1].Quantity);
}
```

#### Removing Lines from Cart
Background context: The `Cart` class should allow users to remove products from their cart. This is implemented using the `RemoveLine` method, which should remove a specific line and update the total quantity of items in the cart.
:p How can you test removing lines from the cart?
??x
You can write a unit test that adds multiple items to the cart and then removes one item, verifying that it no longer appears in the list.

```csharp
[Fact]
public void Can_Remove_Line()
{
    // Arrange - create some test products
    Product p1 = new Product { ProductID = 1, Name = "P1" };
    Product p2 = new Product { ProductID = 2, Name = "P2" };
    Product p3 = new Product { ProductID = 3, Name = "P3" };

    // Arrange - create a new cart
    Cart target = new Cart();

    // Act - add some products to the cart
    target.AddItem(p1, 1);
    target.AddItem(p2, 3);
    target.AddItem(p3, 5);
    target.AddItem(p2, 1);

    // Act
    target.RemoveLine(p2);

    // Assert
    Assert.Empty(target.Lines.Where(c => c.Product == p2));
    Assert.Equal(2, target.Lines.Count());
}
```

#### Testing Cart Total Calculation
Background context: This section explains how to test whether a shopping cart can calculate the total cost of its items. The test involves arranging product objects, adding them to the cart, and then verifying the computed total value against expected values.

:p What is the method for testing the calculation of the cart's total value?

??x
The `Calculate_Cart_Total` method tests whether the cart can correctly compute the total cost of its items. The test involves creating product objects, adding them to a cart with specified quantities, and then verifying that the computed total matches the expected result.

```csharp
[Fact]
public void Calculate_Cart_Total()
{
    // Arrange - create some test products
    Product p1 = new Product { ProductID = 1, Name = "P1", Price = 100M };
    Product p2 = new Product { ProductID = 2, Name = "P2", Price = 50M };

    // Arrange - create a new cart
    Cart target = new Cart();

    // Act
    target.AddItem(p1, 1);
    target.AddItem(p2, 1);
    target.AddItem(p1, 3);
    decimal result = target.ComputeTotalValue();

    // Assert
    Assert.Equal(450M, result);
}
```

#### Clearing Cart Contents
Background context: This section explains how to test whether the contents of a cart can be properly cleared when the cart is reset. The test involves adding items to the cart and then verifying that all items are removed after calling the `Clear` method.

:p How do you ensure that the cart's contents are cleared correctly?

??x
The `Can_Clear_Contents` method tests whether clearing the cart removes all its contents. This involves creating product objects, adding them to a cart, clearing the cart, and then verifying that no items remain in the cart.

```csharp
[Fact]
public void Can_Clear_Contents()
{
    // Arrange - create some test products
    Product p1 = new Product { ProductID = 1, Name = "P1", Price = 100M };
    Product p2 = new Product { ProductID = 2, Name = "P2", Price = 50M };

    // Arrange - create a new cart
    Cart target = new Cart();

    // Arrange - add some items
    target.AddItem(p1, 1);
    target.AddItem(p2, 1);

    // Act - reset the cart
    target.Clear();

    // Assert
    Assert.Empty(target.Lines);
}
```

#### Defining Session State Extensions for Carts
Background context: This section explains how to extend the `ISession` interface in ASP.NET Core to support storing and retrieving `Cart` objects as session data. The extension methods convert `Cart` objects into JSON format and back.

:p How do you define extensions methods to serialize and deserialize Cart objects?

??x
To support storing and retrieving `Cart` objects as session data, the `SessionExtensions.cs` file defines two extension methods: `SetJson` and `GetJson`. These methods use the `System.Text.Json` library to convert `Cart` objects into JSON format for storage and back from JSON to a `Cart` object during retrieval.

```csharp
using System.Text.Json;
namespace SportsStore.Infrastructure 
{
    public static class SessionExtensions  
    {
        public static void SetJson(this ISession session, string key, object value)  
        {  
            session.SetString(key, JsonSerializer.Serialize(value));  
        }  

        public static T? GetJson<T>(this ISession session, string key)  
        {  
            var sessionData = session.GetString(key);  
            return sessionData == null ? default(T) : JsonSerializer.Deserialize<T>(sessionData);  
        }  
    }
}
```

The `SetJson` method serializes a given object into JSON format and sets it as session data, while the `GetJson` method retrieves the serialized data, deserializes it back to an object of type T.

#### Razor Pages Overview and Implementation
Razor Pages is a feature of ASP.NET Core that allows you to create pages with HTML content, Razor expressions, and server-side logic combined in a single file. It supports both rendering views and handling HTTP requests through page model classes.

:p What are the key components of a Razor Page?
??x
The key components of a Razor Page include:
- The `.cshtml` file which contains HTML content and Razor expressions.
- A corresponding `*.cshtml.cs` class file that acts as the page model, defining handler methods for HTTP requests and updating state before rendering views.

Code example:
```csharp
@page
@model CartModel

// Content in .cshtml file
```
```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RazorPages;
using SportsStore.Infrastructure;
using SportsStore.Models;

namespace SportsStore.Pages {
    public class CartModel : PageModel {
        // Implementation of the page model class
    }
}
```

#### `Cart.cshtml.cs` Page Model Class
The `Cart.cshtml.cs` file contains a page model class that handles HTTP requests, updates session state with the cart data, and renders the cart view. It provides methods to initialize the cart and handle POST requests.

:p What is the purpose of the `CartModel` in the `Cart.cshtml.cs` file?
??x
The `CartModel` class is responsible for handling various actions related to the shopping cart:
- Initializing the cart from session state.
- Handling HTTP GET requests by setting the return URL and retrieving or initializing the cart.
- Handling HTTP POST requests, such as adding items to the cart.

Code example:
```csharp
public CartModel(IStoreRepository repo) {
    repository = repo;
}

public Cart? Cart { get; set; }

public string ReturnUrl { get; set; } = "/";

public void OnGet(string returnUrl) {
    ReturnUrl = returnUrl ?? "/";
    Cart = HttpContext.Session.GetJson<Cart>("cart") ??
            new Cart();
}
```
```csharp
public IActionResult OnPost(long productId, string returnUrl) {
    Product? product = repository.Products.FirstOrDefault(p => p.ProductID == productId);
    if (product != null) {
        Cart = HttpContext.Session.GetJson<Cart>("cart") ??
               new Cart();
        Cart.AddItem(product, 1);
        HttpContext.Session.SetJson("cart", Cart);
    }
    return RedirectToPage(new { returnUrl = returnUrl });
}
```

#### Session State Management
Session state in Razor Pages is managed using `HttpContext.Session`. The cart data is stored as JSON in the session, allowing it to persist across multiple requests.

:p How does the application manage session-based cart data?
??x
The application manages session-based cart data by storing and retrieving the cart from `HttpContext.Session`:
```csharp
Cart = HttpContext.Session.GetJson<Cart>("cart") ??
        new Cart();
```
When a user adds an item to the cart, the updated cart is stored back in the session with:
```csharp
HttpContext.Session.SetJson("cart", Cart);
```

#### Razor Pages Overview
Razor Pages are a way to build web applications using ASP.NET Core, providing an alternative to MVC (Model-View-Controller) for simpler scenarios. They allow you to handle both GET and POST requests within a single page lifecycle.
:p What are Razor Pages used for?
??x
Razor Pages are used for building self-contained features in web applications where the complexity of the MVC framework might be overkill. They simplify development by handling both GET and POST requests within one class, making it easier to manage state and user interactions without much boilerplate code.
x??

**Rating: 8/10**

#### Product Retrieval and Cart Management
Razor Pages retrieve products from a database and handle cart management using session data. When a product is added to the cart, the cart's content is updated, stored back in the session, and the browser is redirected via a GET request to refresh the page without triggering duplicate POST requests.
:p How does Razor Page manage adding a product to the cart?
??x
When a user clicks an "Add To Cart" button for a product, the following steps occur:
1. The product details are retrieved from the database.
2. The current cart (stored in session) is updated with the new item.
3. The updated cart is stored back in the session.
4. A GET request is sent to refresh the page and display the updated cart content.

This process prevents duplicate POST requests when the browser is refreshed, ensuring that the cart's state remains consistent between requests.

#### Testing Razor Pages with Mocks
Testing Razor Pages often requires setting up mocks for dependencies like repositories and session stores. This helps simulate the environment in which the page model operates.
:p How can you test a Razor Page using mocks?
??x
To test a Razor Page, especially methods that interact with session data or external services, you can use mocking frameworks to create mock objects for these dependencies.

Example:
```csharp
public class CartPageTests {
    [Fact]
    public void Can_Load_Cart() {
        // Arrange
        Product p1 = new Product { ProductID = 1, Name = "P1" };
        Product p2 = new Product { ProductID = 2, Name = "P2" };
        
        Mock<IStoreRepository> mockRepo = new Mock<IStoreRepository>();
        mockRepo.Setup(m => m.Products).Returns((new Product[] {
            p1, p2
        }).AsQueryable<Product>());
        
        Cart testCart = new Cart();
        testCart.AddItem(p1, 2);
        testCart.AddItem(p2, 1);
        
        Mock<ISession> mockSession = new Mock<ISession>();
        byte[] data = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(
            JsonSerializer.Serialize(testCart)
        );
        mockSession.Setup(c => 
            c.TryGetValue(It.IsAny<string>(), out data));
        
        Mock<HttpContext> mockContext = new Mock<HttpContext>();
        mockContext.SetupGet(c => 
            c.Session).Returns(mockSession.Object);
        
        // Action
        CartModel cartModel = new CartModel(mockRepo.Object) {
            PageContext = new PageContext(new ActionContext { 
                HttpContext = mockContext.Object, 
                RouteData = new RouteData(), 
                ActionDescriptor = new PageActionDescriptor() 
            })
        };
        cartModel.OnGet("myUrl");
        
        // Assert
        Assert.Equal(2, cartModel.Cart?.Lines.Count());
        Assert.Equal("myUrl", cartModel.ReturnUrl);
    }
}
```

#### Displaying Cart Contents and Navigation
After adding a product to the cart, the Razor Page displays an updated summary of the cart contents. A button is provided for users to continue shopping or return to the previous page.
:p How does the Razor Page display the cart's contents?
??x
The Razor Page uses the `OnGet` handler method to load and display the current state of the cart. The `CartModel` class contains properties that hold the cart data, which is then used in the Razor view to render the list of items.

```csharp
public void OnGet(string returnUrl) {
    // Load cart from session or repository
    Cart = HttpContext.Session.GetCart();
    
    // Set the return URL for navigation
    ReturnUrl = returnUrl;
}
```

In the corresponding Razor view (e.g., `Index.cshtml`), you can access these properties to generate content:
```razor
@model SportsStore.Pages.CartModel

<h2>Shopping Cart</h2>
@if (Model?.Cart.Lines.Count() > 0) {
    <ul>
        @foreach (var line in Model.Cart.Lines) {
            <li>@line.Product.Name - x@line.Quantity</li>
        }
    </ul>
} else {
    <p>Your cart is empty.</p>
}

<a asp-page-handler="ContinueShopping" class="btn btn-primary">Continue Shopping</a>
```

The `ReturnUrl` property is used to set the URL for navigation:
```csharp
return Page();
```

#### Navigation Controls and URL Composition
Background context: In ASP.NET Core, navigation controls are used to allow users to browse through different categories of products. These controls typically include the selected category in the request URL, which is useful for server-side routing and data fetching.

:p How does the navigation control handle the selected category in the request URL?
??x
Navigation controls in ASP.NET Core append the selected category to the request URL as a query parameter or path segment. This allows the application to determine the current category when processing requests, facilitating database queries based on the category. For example, if a user is viewing products under "Electronics" and clicks "Next Page," the URL might change to include the category in the path: `/Electronics?page=2`.

```csharp
// Example of URL composition
string url = $"/Category/{selectedCategory}/Page/{pageNumber}";
```

#### Razor Pages and Shopping Cart Display
Background context: Razor Pages are a simplified approach to creating web pages in ASP.NET Core. They are well-suited for self-contained features like displaying the contents of a shopping cart, where the page handles both presentation and logic.

:p Why are Razor Pages suitable for simple self-contained features such as a shopping cart?
??x
Razor Pages are ideal for simple self-contained scenarios because they combine HTML markup (Razor syntax) with C# code. This makes it easy to handle both the display of data and the necessary business logic, all within a single file.

```csharp
// Example of Razor Page for displaying shopping cart contents
public class CartModel : PageModel
{
    public void OnGet()
    {
        // Code to retrieve and display cart contents
    }
}
```

#### Sessions for Data Persistence
Background context: In web applications, sessions are used to associate data with a series of related requests. This is particularly useful for maintaining state across multiple user interactions.

:p How do sessions help in managing the state of a shopping cart?
??x
Sessions allow you to store user-specific data that persists between HTTP requests. For a shopping cart feature, this means retaining items added by the user as they navigate through different pages on your site without losing their selections.

```csharp
// Example of setting and accessing session data in ASP.NET Core
public void OnPostAdd(int id)
{
    var cart = HttpContext.Session.Get CART(); // Retrieve or initialize cart
    cart.AddToCart(product);
    HttpContext.Session.Set CART(cart); // Save updated cart back to session
}
```
