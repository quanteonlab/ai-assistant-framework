#### Creating and Using a Razor View
In ASP.NET Core, views are used to display data to the user. The provided `Index.cshtml` file is an example of how you can create a simple view using Razor syntax.

:p What is the purpose of the `@model IEnumerable<string>` statement in the `Index.cshtml` file?
??x
The `@model` directive specifies the type of data that will be passed to the view. In this case, it expects an enumerable collection of strings (`IEnumerable<string>`). This allows you to loop over the items and display them on the page.

```csharp
// Example in C#
public class HomeModel {
    public IEnumerable<string> Items { get; set; }
}
```

#### Setting HTTP Port in ASP.NET Core
The `launchSettings.json` file allows you to configure how your application runs during development. The `applicationUrl` setting specifies the URL where the app will run.

:p How do you change the HTTP port that ASP.NET Core uses to receive requests?
??x
To change the HTTP port, you need to update the `applicationUrl` setting in the `launchSettings.json` file under the relevant profile. For example:

```json
{
  "profiles": {
    "LanguageFeatures": {
      "commandName": "Project",
      "dotnetRunMessages": true,
      "launchBrowser": true,
      "applicationUrl": "http://localhost:5001", // Changed to port 5001
      "environmentVariables": {
        "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
      }
    },
    "IIS Express": {
      "commandName": "IISExpress",
      "launchBrowser": true,
      "environmentVariables": {
        "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This change tells ASP.NET Core to run the application on `http://localhost:5001` instead of the default `http://localhost:5000`.

#### Running an ASP.NET Core Application
Background context: The provided text describes how to run a simple example application using ASP.NET Core. This involves starting the application via a command-line instruction and observing the output.

:p How do you start the example application described in this chapter?
??x
To start the example application, use the `dotnet run` command within the Language-Features folder. Once executed, the application will be hosted on `http://localhost:5000`, where it can be accessed via a web browser.

```bash
# Command to run the ASP.NET Core application
dotnet run
```

#### Top-Level Statements in ASP.NET Core
Background context: The text explains that top-level statements are used to simplify the configuration of an ASP.NET Core application. Traditionally, this was done through a `Startup` class, but now it can be done directly within `Program.cs`.

:p What is the purpose of using top-level statements in ASP.NET Core?
??x
Top-level statements in ASP.NET Core are intended to simplify the configuration process by allowing all necessary setup and configuration to be performed directly in the `Program.cs` file. This removes the need for a separate `Startup` class, making the code cleaner and easier to manage.

```csharp
// Example of Program.cs using top-level statements
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.Services.AddControllersWithViews();

var app = builder.Build();
app.MapDefaultControllerRoute();
app.Run();
```

This approach centralizes all application setup into a single file, improving readability and maintainability.

#### Null State Analysis in ASP.NET Core
Null state analysis is an enabling feature of the ASP.NET Core project templates that helps identify potential null reference exceptions by analyzing references at compile time. It prevents runtime errors caused by accessing potentially null objects.

:p What is null state analysis?
??x
Null state analysis is a compiler feature enabled by ASP.NET Core project templates that identifies and warns about attempts to access references that might be unintentionally null, thereby preventing null reference exceptions during runtime.
```csharp
// Example of warning due to potential null reference in Product.cs
public string GetProductName() {
    return product.Name; // Potential null reference if product is null
}
```

#### Handling Null References in C#
Handling null references is crucial in programming, as they can lead to runtime errors like `NullReferenceException`. Nullable types and the `required` keyword help manage this risk.

:p What are the implications of using non-nullable types with properties in C#?
??x
When a property or field has a non-nullable type (e.g., `string`), it must always have a valid value. You cannot assign `null` to such a property, even indirectly. To ensure that every instance is properly initialized, you can use the `required` keyword.

For example:
```csharp
public required string Name { get; set; }
```
This ensures that when an object of the class containing this property is created, its `Name` must be assigned a non-null value.

#### Nullable Types and Arrays
Background context: In C#, nullable types allow variables to hold null values. This is useful when you want to allow the absence of a value, such as in an array.

:p What change was made in Listing 5.14 to address the warning about null values in arrays?
??x
The change involved using `Product?[]` instead of `Product[]`, allowing the array to contain nullable `Product` references.

#### Summary and Differentiation
Background context: The flashcards cover various aspects of handling nullable types in C#, including the use of default values with properties, understanding arrays with nullable references, and differentiating between allowed null states.

:p How do you handle situations where a property might not have an initial value?
??x
You can provide a default value by assigning it directly to the property within its declaration. For example: `public string Name { get; set; } = string.Empty;`.
