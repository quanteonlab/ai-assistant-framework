#### View Components in ASP.NET Core

View components are C# classes that provide reusable application logic and can render Razor partial views. They are perfect for creating UI elements like navigation menus.

:p What is a view component in ASP.NET Core used for?

??x
A view component in ASP.NET Core is a C# class that provides small amounts of reusable application logic and has the ability to select and display Razor partial views. It can be invoked from Razor views or layout files, making it an ideal tool for creating dynamic UI elements like navigation menus.

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

namespace SportsStore.Components
{
    public class NavigationMenuViewComponent : ViewComponent
    {
        public IViewComponentResult Invoke()
        {
            // Logic to fetch and return category list
            var categories = GetCategoryList();
            return View(categories);
        }

        private List<string> GetCategoryList()
        {
            // Example logic to get category list from data source
            return new List<string> { "Electronics", "Sports Gear", "Clothing" };
        }
    }
}
```

#### Integrating the Navigation Menu into Shared Layout

To integrate the navigation menu, you can use a view component in your shared layout file. This ensures that the menu appears on every page.

:p How do you use a view component within a Razor view or layout?

??x
You use a view component by adding a tag helper to your Razor view or layout file. For instance, in the `_Layout.cshtml` file, you can add the following line:

```html
<vc:navigation-menu />
```

This tag helper calls the `Invoke()` method of the `NavigationMenuViewComponent`, which returns the HTML content for the navigation menu.

Example within a layout file (`_Layout.cshtml`):

```html
<div id="categories" class="col-3">
    <vc:navigation-menu />
</div>
```

Here, `vc:` is used to denote that this is a view component, and `navigation-menu` is the name of the class implementing the view component.

#### Category List in Navigation Menu

The category list in the navigation menu needs to be dynamic. This involves fetching data from a data source or a database and rendering it appropriately within the view component.

:p What should the `Invoke()` method return for the category list?

??x
The `Invoke()` method in the view component is responsible for returning the HTML content that represents the category list. Initially, it might return a simple string, but to provide dynamic content, it should fetch and render a list of categories from a data source.

Example implementation:

```csharp
public class NavigationMenuViewComponent : ViewComponent
{
    public IViewComponentResult Invoke()
    {
        var categories = GetCategoryList();
        return View(categories);
    }

    private List<string> GetCategoryList()
    {
        // Example logic to get category list from data source
        return new List<string> { "Electronics", "Sports Gear", "Clothing" };
    }
}
```

Here, `GetCategoryList()` fetches the categories and returns them as a list. The `Invoke()` method then passes this list to the corresponding Razor view (`NavigationMenu.cshtml`), which renders it.

#### Rendering Partial Views with View Components

A view component can select and display Razor partial views based on the data passed from its `Invoke()` method.

:p How does a view component render a partial view?

??x
When you return an `IViewComponentResult`, the framework automatically selects the appropriate Razor partial view. The name of this partial view should match the name of the view component, with certain naming conventions:

- If the view component class is named `NavigationMenuViewComponent`, then the corresponding partial view should be named `_NavigationMenu.cshtml`.
- This partial view will receive the data passed from the `Invoke()` method and use it to render the UI.

Example usage in the Razor partial view (`_NavigationMenu.cshtml`):

```razor
@model List<string>

<ul class="list-unstyled">
    @foreach (var category in Model)
    {
        <li><a asp-action="Index" asp-route-category="@category">@category</a></li>
    }
</ul>
```

In this example, the `Invoke()` method passes a list of categories to the partial view. The partial view then iterates through these categories and generates an HTML unordered list with links for each category.

#### Using a View Component
Background context: In ASP.NET Core, view components are reusable pieces of UI that can be embedded into views. They provide a more flexible way to create complex user interfaces compared to partial views or helper methods.

:p How does using a view component help in generating category lists?
??x
Using a view component helps in dynamically generating category lists by leveraging the power of Razor syntax and LINQ queries. This approach allows for clean separation between UI logic and data logic, making the code more maintainable and testable.

In this example, the `NavigationMenuViewComponent` class uses an `IStoreRepository` to fetch products and then selects unique categories from these products, orders them alphabetically, and returns a view containing these categories. This is done in a way that abstracts the underlying data access logic, making it easy to switch between different repository implementations without changing the UI code.

```csharp
public class NavigationMenuViewComponent : ViewComponent
{
    private IStoreRepository repository;

    public NavigationMenuViewComponent(IStoreRepository repo)
    {
        repository = repo;
    }

    public IViewComponentResult Invoke()
    {
        return View(repository.Products
            .Select(x => x.Category)
            .Distinct()
            .OrderBy(x => x));
    }
}
```

#### Dependency Injection for View Components
Background context: Dependency injection is a design pattern that allows objects to be passed the dependencies they need to function. In ASP.NET Core, this mechanism extends to view components as well, allowing them to access services and repositories without hardcoding any specific implementation.

:p How does dependency injection work in the `NavigationMenuViewComponent` class?
??x
Dependency injection works by passing an instance of a service (in this case, `IStoreRepository`) into the constructor of the view component. When ASP.NET Core creates an instance of `NavigationMenuViewComponent`, it resolves and injects the correct implementation of `IStoreRepository` based on the configuration in `Program.cs`.

This allows the `NavigationMenuViewComponent` to interact with data sources without being tightly coupled to any specific implementation, promoting loose coupling and easier testing.

```csharp
public class NavigationMenuViewComponent : ViewComponent
{
    private IStoreRepository repository;

    public NavigationMenuViewComponent(IStoreRepository repo)
    {
        repository = repo;
    }

    // Invoke method remains the same as in previous examples.
}
```

#### Testing a View Component
Background context: Unit testing is crucial for ensuring that components and services work as expected. In this case, we need to test whether our `NavigationMenuViewComponent` can correctly generate a list of categories.

:p How would you write a unit test for the `NavigationMenuViewComponent`?
??x
To write a unit test for the `NavigationMenuViewComponent`, you would use mocking libraries like Moq to simulate the behavior of dependencies. The goal is to ensure that the component returns the correct, sorted list of unique categories.

Here's an example using XUnit and Moq:

```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ViewComponents;
using Moq;
using SportsStore.Components;
using SportsStore.Models;
using Xunit;

public class NavigationMenuViewComponentTests
{
    [Fact]
    public void Can_Select_Categories()
    {
        // Arrange
        Mock<IStoreRepository> mock = new Mock<IStoreRepository>();
        mock.Setup(m => m.Products).Returns(new Product[]
        {
            new Product { ProductID = 1, Name = "P1", Category = "Apples" },
            new Product { ProductID = 2, Name = "P2", Category = "Apples" },
            new Product { ProductID = 3, Name = "P3", Category = "Plums" },
            new Product { ProductID = 4, Name = "P4", Category = "Oranges" }
        }.AsQueryable<Product>());

        NavigationMenuViewComponent target = new NavigationMenuViewComponent(mock.Object);

        // Act
        string[] results = ((IEnumerable<string>?)(target.Invoke() as ViewComponentResult)?.ViewData?.Model ?? Enumerable.Empty<string>().ToArray());

        // Assert
        var expectedCategories = new List<string> { "Apples", "Oranges", "Plums" };
        CollectionAssert.AreEqual(expectedCategories, results);
    }
}
```

#### Generating Categories with LINQ and ViewComponentResult
Background context: The `Invoke` method in view components is where the logic for rendering data into a view is implemented. In this example, we use LINQ to process the categories from the repository before passing them to the view.

:p How does the `Invoke` method generate unique and sorted categories?
??x
The `Invoke` method uses LINQ to select distinct categories from the products stored in the repository. It then sorts these categories alphabetically and returns a `ViewComponentResult`, which renders the default Razor partial view containing the processed data.

Here's how it works:

1. Select distinct categories using `.Distinct()`.
2. Order the selected categories using `.OrderBy(x => x)`.
3. Return the result as an `IViewComponentResult` object, which will render the appropriate Razor view with the ordered and unique category list.

```csharp
public IViewComponentResult Invoke()
{
    return View(repository.Products
        .Select(x => x.Category)
        .Distinct()
        .OrderBy(x => x));
}
```

#### Razor View Component for Navigation Menu
Background context: The text describes creating a Razor view component to generate navigation links for product categories. This component dynamically creates anchor tags based on the provided category data.

:p What is the purpose of the `Default.cshtml` file in the `SportsStore/Views/Shared/Components/NavigationMenu` folder?
??x
The purpose of the `Default.cshtml` file is to generate navigation links for product categories using Razor syntax, creating a dynamic and user-friendly menu that allows users to filter products by category.

#### Using Mock to Test View Component
Background context: The unit test ensures that the view component correctly adds details of the selected category by reading the value from the `ViewBag` property. This is done using a mock object and setting up the required routing data.

:p How does the unit test verify the correct selection of the category?
??x
The unit test sets up a mock repository with specific product data and assigns a selected category to the route data. It then invokes the view component, casts the result as `ViewViewComponentResult`, accesses the `ViewData` dictionary from the result, and checks if the `SelectedCategory` matches the expected value.

```csharp
[Fact]
public void Indicates_Selected_Category()
{
    // Arrange
    string categoryToSelect = "Apples";
    Mock<IStoreRepository> mock = new Mock<IStoreRepository>();
    mock.Setup(m => m.Products).Returns((new Product[] {
        new Product {ProductID = 1, Name = "P1", Category = "Apples"},
        new Product {ProductID = 4, Name = "P2", Category = "Oranges"}
    }).AsQueryable<Product>());
    NavigationMenuViewComponent target = 
        new NavigationMenuViewComponent(mock.Object);
    target.ViewComponentContext = new ViewComponentContext {
        ViewContext = new ViewContext {
            RouteData = new Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.RouteData()
        }
    };
    target.RouteData.Values["category"] = categoryToSelect;
    
    // Action
    string? result = (string?)(target.Invoke() as ViewViewComponentResult)?.ViewData["SelectedCategory"];
    
    // Assert
    Assert.Equal(categoryToSelect, result);
}
```

#### Highlighting Selected Categories
Background context: The provided code snippet demonstrates how to highlight selected categories using Bootstrap classes. This is achieved by dynamically applying the `btn-primary` class to the currently selected category and `btn-outline-secondary` to other categories.
:p How does the code highlight the selected category?
??x
The code uses Razor syntax within the `class` attribute of an anchor tag to conditionally apply Bootstrap styling based on whether the current category matches the selected category. If it matches, the `btn-primary` class is applied; otherwise, `btn-outline-secondary`.
```html
@foreach (string category in Model ?? Enumerable.Empty<string>()) {
    <a class="btn @(category == ViewBag.SelectedCategory ? "btn-primary" : "btn-outline-secondary")"
       asp-action="Index" asp-controller="Home" 
       asp-route-category="@category"
       asp-route-productPage="1">
        @category
    </a>
}
```

#### Correcting Page Count for Selected Categories
Background context: The provided code snippet aims to adjust the pagination logic so that it correctly reflects the number of products in a selected category. This ensures users do not end up on an empty page if they navigate through multiple pages.
:p How does the Index action method update to handle categories properly?
??x
The `Index` action method now takes into account the selected category when determining pagination information. If no category is specified, it uses the total number of products; otherwise, it calculates based on the current category’s product count.
```csharp
public ViewResult Index(string? category, int productPage = 1)
{
    return View(new ProductsListViewModel {
        Products = repository.Products
            .Where(p => category == null || p.Category == category)
            .OrderBy(p => p.ProductID)
            .Skip((productPage - 1) * PageSize)
            .Take(PageSize),
        PagingInfo = new PagingInfo {
            CurrentPage = productPage,
            ItemsPerPage = PageSize,
            TotalItems = category == null
                ? repository.Products.Count()
                : repository.Products.Where(e => e.Category == category).Count()
        },
        CurrentCategory = category
    });
}
```

#### Unit Test for Category-Specific Product Counts
Background context: The provided unit test ensures that the application can correctly count products in different categories. This is crucial for accurate pagination and display of product lists.
:p How does the unit test verify category-specific product counts?
??x
The unit test creates a mock repository with predefined data across multiple categories. It then calls the `Index` action method for each category, verifying that the returned product count matches the expected value.
```csharp
[Fact]
public void Generate_Category_Specific_Product_Count()
{
    // Arrange
    Mock<IStoreRepository> mock = new Mock<IStoreRepository>();
    Product[] products = {
        new Product {ProductID = 1, Name = "P1", Category = "Cat1"},
        new Product {ProductID = 2, Name = "P2", Category = "Cat2"},
        new Product {ProductID = 3, Name = "P3", Category = "Cat1"},
        new Product {ProductID = 4, Name = "P4", Category = "Cat2"},
        new Product {ProductID = 5, Name = "P5", Category = "Cat3"}
    };
    mock.Setup(m => m.Products).Returns(products.AsQueryable<Product>());
    HomeController target = new HomeController(mock.Object);
    target.PageSize = 3;

    // Act
    var result1 = target.Index("Cat1");
    var model1 = ((ViewResult)result1).Model as ProductsListViewModel;
    int countCat1 = model1.PagingInfo.TotalItems;

    var result2 = target.Index("Cat2");
    var model2 = ((ViewResult)result2).Model as ProductsListViewModel;
    int countCat2 = model2.PagingInfo.TotalItems;

    // Assert
    Assert.Equal(3, countCat1);  // Cat1 has 3 products
    Assert.Equal(2, countCat2);  // Cat2 has 2 products
}
```
