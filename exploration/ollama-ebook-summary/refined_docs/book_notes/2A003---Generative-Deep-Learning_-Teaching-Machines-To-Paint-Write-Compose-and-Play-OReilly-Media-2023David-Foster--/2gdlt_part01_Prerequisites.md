#### Generative Modeling
Background context: The book introduces generative modeling as a fundamental concept that allows for the creation of new data samples similar to those from an existing dataset. This is crucial for tasks such as image synthesis, language generation, and more.

:p What is generative modeling in the context of this book?
??x
Generative modeling refers to the process of creating models capable of generating new instances of data that are similar to a given dataset. These models learn the underlying distribution of the data and can generate samples that are indistinguishable from real examples within the same domain.

#### Deep Learning
Background context: The book delves into deep learning, specifically through neural networks like multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) using Keras. It explores how these networks can be adapted for various tasks by adding different layers and architectures.

:p What is a multilayer perceptron (MLP)?
??x
A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a type of feedforward artificial neural network that consists of multiple layers of nodes with each layer fully connected to the next one. It is used for classification, regression, and other tasks.

#### Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
Background context: VAEs are discussed as a method in generative modeling where the model learns an encoding distribution over data points and then decodes it back into a sample.

:p What is a variational autoencoder (VAE)?
??x
A variational autoencoder (VAE) is a type of generative model that uses a probabilistic approach to learn a compressed latent space representation of input data. It consists of an encoder network that maps the input data to a distribution in the latent space, and a decoder network that reconstructs the original data from this distribution.

Mathematically, the encoder outputs two parameters (mean $\mu $ and log variance$\log\sigma^2$) of a Gaussian distribution:
$$q(z|x) = \mathcal{N}(\mu(x), \Sigma(x))$$

The decoder takes samples $z$ from this distribution to generate new data points.

#### Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
Background context: GANs are introduced as a framework where two neural networks, the generator and discriminator, compete against each other in a minimax game.

:p What is a generative adversarial network (GAN)?
??x
A generative adversarial network (GAN) consists of two neural networks: the generator and the discriminator. The generator creates new data instances, while the discriminator evaluates whether generated samples are real or fake. Through an iterative training process, both networks improve their performance until the generated data is indistinguishable from real data.

The objective function in a GAN can be formulated as:
$$\min_{G} \max_{D} V(D, G) = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{data}(x)}[\log D(x)] + \mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_z(z)}[\log (1 - D(G(z)))]$$

Where $D $ is the discriminator and$G$ is the generator.

#### Autoregressive Models
Background context: The concept of autoregressive models, particularly recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as LSTM for text generation and PixelCNN for image generation, are discussed.

:p What are autoregressive models?
??x
Autoregressive models predict each element in a sequence based on the previous elements. In the context of this book, they include models like Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) used for text generation and PixelCNNs used for image generation.

For example, an LSTM can be defined as:
$$\begin{aligned}
i_t &= \sigma(W_{xi} x_t + W_{hi} h_{t-1} + b_i) \\
f_t &= \sigma(W_{xf} x_t + W_{hf} h_{t-1} + b_f) \\
c_t &= f_t \odot c_{t-1} + i_t \odot \tanh(W_{xc} x_t + W_{hc} h_{t-1} + b_c) \\
o_t &= \sigma(W_{xo} x_t + W_{ho} h_{t-1} + b_o) \\
h_t &= o_t \odot \tanh(c_t)
\end{aligned}$$

Where $i_t, f_t, c_t, o_t$ are the input, forget, cell state, and output gates respectively.

#### Normalizing Flow Models
Background context: This section introduces normalizing flows as a technique to model complex probability distributions by transforming simpler ones.

:p What are normalizing flow models?
??x
Normalizing flow models transform a simple base distribution (e.g., a standard normal distribution) into a more complex target distribution through a series of invertible transformations. These models allow for efficient sampling and density evaluation, making them useful in generative modeling tasks.

A simple example using the RealNVP model involves a sequence of bijective transformations that are composed to form a flow:
$$z = \text{affine}(\theta, x)$$

Where $x $ is the input data and$z$ is the transformed latent space.

#### Energy-Based Models
Background context: The book covers energy-based models which are trained by minimizing an energy function that measures how likely or unlikely a given configuration of variables is.

:p What are energy-based models?
??x
Energy-based models (EBMs) are probabilistic models where the probability distribution over data points is defined as:
$$p(x) = \frac{1}{Z} e^{-E(x)}$$

Where $E(x)$ is an energy function that measures how likely a configuration of variables $ x $ is. The normalizing constant $Z$ ensures that the probabilities sum to 1.

Training involves minimizing the negative log-likelihood:
$$-\log p(x_i) = E(x_i) + \log Z$$

For practical training, contrastive divergence and Langevin dynamics can be used.
