08-What Youre Not to Read.pdf,08-What Youre Not to Read,"Introduction\nI \nn The Paper Chase,  a TV series based on a 1973 movie about the adven -\ntures of first-year law students at Harvard, Professor Kingsfield, the \nContracts professor, tells his students the following:\nThe study of law is something new and unfamiliar to most of you, unlike \nany other schooling you have ever known before. You teach yourselves \nthe law, but I train your minds. You come in here with a skull full of mush, \nand, if you survive, you leave thinking like a lawyer.\nGetting you to think like a lawyer is the goal of law school, but reaching that \ngoal can seem more arduous than it has to be. When you take the course \ncalled Contracts, for example, you’ll probably find that you’re mostly reading \ncases, and you never see a contract.\nOne reason for this disconnect is that the course in Contracts is traditionally \ndesigned to teach you “legal method” — skills such as reading cases, analy -\nsis, and synthesis — and not the substance of contract law, which is often \nsort of incidental. The only problem is that you have to know the rules and \nprinciples of contract law in order to have some grist for the analytical mill.\nBecause your casebook may not present the material in an easily accessible \nand understandable format, Contract Law For Dummies  is designed to plug that \ngap. It can help you wrap your brain around the most fundamental concepts \nand help you see the forest, not just the trees. Consider this book your step -\nstool up to the higher-complexity coverage you’ll encounter in your classes.\nAbout This Book\nContract law isn’t exactly a science or an art; it’s a little of each. As a science, \ncontract law is governed by certain principles and rules. As an art, contract \nlaw often requires creativity as courts apply the rules and interpret the lan -\nguage of contracts. Because of this, Contract Law For Dummies  contains a \nlittle of both. It presents the rules that govern contracts and provides numer -\nous examples to help you apply those rules to different fact situations. This \npresentation enables you, as a budding contract lawyer, to do the following:\n2 Contract Law For Dummies \n ✓ More accurately predict a court’s ruling on any given contract dispute.\n ✓ Know when you have to follow a rule and when you can change it.\n ✓ Draft contracts that more effectively protect your clients’ interests.\n ✓ Pass your law school and bar exams.\nThis book is organized so you can read it from cover to cover or skip around \nto only those parts, chapters, or sections that capture your current fancy or \nserve your present needs. I’ve been teaching contract law for 30 years and \npracticed it for 7 years before that, and I’ve developed a unique approach \nthat has been very successful for my students. This book follows that \napproach, presenting what you need to know in the order that tends  \nto be most effective.\nAs you’ll soon discover, however, developing the skills required for under -\nstanding and practicing contract law — and doing it well — isn’t always a \nlinear path. While discovering new concepts and ways to interpret the lan -\nguage of contracts, you often must skip back to review what you thought you \nalready knew and understood. This book is optimized for skipping around to \nfind exactly what you need whenever you happen to need it.\nConventions Used in This Book\nI use several conventions in this book to call your attention to certain items. \nFor example:\n ✓ Italic  highlights new, somewhat technical terms (such as objective  \nmanifestation and parol evidence ), which I follow up with straight-  \nforward, easy-to-understand definitions.\n ✓ Boldface  text indicates keywords and phrases in bulleted and  \nnumbered lists.\n ✓ Monofont  highlights web addresses.\n ✓ A widget  is a hypothetical good bought and sold in Contracts classes.\n ✓ Contracts  with a capital C refers to the study of the subject, and  \ncontracts with a small c refers to agreements.\n ✓ I generally cite the North Carolina version of the Uniform Commercial \nCode (UCC), because the Uniform version is under copyright, whereas \nan enacted statute is in the public domain.\n ✓ When I refer to “the Code,” I mean the UCC. And when you see “the \nRestatement,” I’m referring to the Second Restatement of Contracts.",4320

10-How This Book Is Organized.pdf,10-How This Book Is Organized,"3  Introduction\nWhat You’re Not to Read\nYou can safely skip anything you see in a gray shaded box. We stuck this \nmaterial in a box (called a sidebar ) for the same reason that most people \nstick stuff in boxes: to get it out of the way so you don’t trip over it. However, \nyou may find the brief asides in the sidebars engaging, entertaining, and per -\nhaps even mildly informative.\nFoolish Assumptions\nIn writing this book, I made a few foolish assumptions, mostly about your \nmotivation and how you’re going to use this book:\n ✓ You’re planning to master U.S. contract law. This book mentions  \nEnglish law, international law, and the contract law of other countries \nonly in passing.\n ✓ You’re eager to tackle contract law.\n ✓ You’re probably going to supplement this text with more formal study, \nincluding coursework, additional reading, assignments, and briefing  \nthe cases.\n ✓ You understand that my approach to teaching contract law is only one \nof many effective ways.\n ✓ In class, you won’t say, “But Burnham says. . . .”\nI make no assumptions concerning how much you already know about con -\ntract law — you needn’t know anything to get started.\nHow This Book Is Organized\nTo assist you in navigating this book’s contents, I divvied up the chapters \nthat comprise this book into seven distinct parts. This section provides a \nquick overview of what I cover in each part.\n4 Contract Law For Dummies \nPart I: Introducing Contract Law  \nand Contract Formation\nIn a contract law case, one of the first things the court has to determine is \nwhether the parties even have a contract. The chapters in this part introduce \nand explain the essential elements of contract formation (offer, acceptance, \nand consideration) along with notable exceptions — promises that are \nenforceable without a contract.\nAs a bonus, Chapter 1 provides an overview of contract law and introduces \nyou to the two sources of governing rules: the Restatement of Contracts and \nthe Uniform Commercial Code (UCC).\nPart II: Determining Whether a Contract  \nIs Void, Voidable, or Unenforceable\nTo challenge the formation of a contract in the court of law, a party may \npresent a contract defense  — proof claiming that certain additional facts \nundermine the contract’s formation and destroy its enforceability. This part \nexplains different contract defenses, including whether a party did anything \nillegal or unfair and whether the parties had the ability to make a contract, as \nwell as the factors that determine whether an oral agreement is enforceable.\nPart III: Analyzing Contract  \nTerms and Their Meaning\nContract disputes arise when the parties don’t concur on which terms they \nagreed to or what the terms mean. One party may claim that the parties \nagreed to a term that doesn’t appear in the written contract. A contract may \nhave gaps that fail to address unforeseen circumstances. Or the language in \na contract may be ambiguous. The chapters in this part discuss several strat -\negies that the courts use to plug the gaps in a contract and interpret what \nthe language really means . . . or at least what it would mean to reasonable \npeople standing in the parties’ shoes.\nPart IV: Performing the  \nContract or Breaching It\nWhether the parties formed a contract is only half the story. The other half \ndeals with the performance of that contract. The chapters in this part tackle \n5  Introduction\nnonperformance issues. Here you find out whether changes made to a con -\ntract after formation are enforceable, whether the occurrence of unforeseen \nevents or the nonoccurrence of certain conditions excuses performance, and \nhow one party may breach a contract even before performance is due.\nPart V: Exploring Remedies  \nfor Breach of Contract\nIf a party breaches the contract, the courts must decide how to remedy the \nbreach in a way that’s fair for both parties. This isn’t tort law, where the \ncourts try to punish the wrongdoer. In contract law, the goal is to give the \nnon-breaching party what she expected from the performance of the contract \nbut no more than that. The non-breaching party shouldn’t get a windfall at \nthe expense of the breaching party.\nThe chapters in this part introduce and explain the various methods avail -\nable to the courts to remedy a breach.\nPart VI: Bringing Third  \nParties into the Picture\nA contract often affects more than the parties who made it. A contract is like a \npiece of property that can be carved up and bought and sold. When parts are \ntransferred, third parties can get involved in performance and enforcement of \nthe contract. The chapters in this part help you recognize the rights and duties \nof those third parties and decide under which circumstances third parties are \nallowed to enforce contracts and may have duties to perform under a contract.\nPart VII: The Part of Tens\nEvery For Dummies  book includes a Part of Tens — chapters containing ten \nbite-sized, easily digestible tips, tricks, or insights. Here I offer ten key ques -\ntions to ask when analyzing a contract problem and ten famous people and \nphilosophies in contract law.",5178

Here are the icons and a brief description of each.\n Everything in this book is important (except for the stuff in the shaded boxes), \nbut some information is even more  important. When you see this icon, read the \ntext next to it not once but two or three times to tattoo it on your gray matter.\n Tips provide insider insight from behind the scenes. When you’re looking for a \nbetter, faster way to do something, check out these tips.\n This icon appears when you need to be extra vigilant or seek additional guid -\nance before moving forward. Don’t skip this important information — I’m \nwarning you!\n Certain cases have strongly influenced contract law and how the courts inter -\npret the law and language of contracts. To spot these key cases, look for the \nKey Case icon.\n Contract law makes a lot more sense when you see how it applies to fact situa -\ntions, so I use hypothetical situations liberally throughout the book to illus -\ntrate and simplify the explanation of certain concepts. The Example icon flags \nthese hypotheticals so you can easily spot them.\nWhere to Go From Here\nContract Law For Dummies  is designed to take you from ground zero to a funda -\nmental understanding of contract law. If you’re interested in the big-picture view \nof contract law in theory and practice, check out Chapter 1. Otherwise, read the \nbook from cover to cover, skip around by using the table of contents as your \nguide, or head to the index if you need guidance on a more specific topic.\nPart I\nIntroducing \nContract Law and \nContract Formation\nIn this part . . .\nC \nhapter 1 begins by exploring the fundamentals of \ncontract law — what it is, how it came into being, \nand which sources provide the rules and principles that \ngovern contracts. Here, you discover the basics of  \ncontract formation, contract defenses, and contract  \ninterpretation, and you find out what generally happens \nwhen parties don’t fulfill their contractual obligations.\nThe remaining chapters in this part focus on contract  \nformation. You encounter the three essential elements  \nof contract formation — offer, acceptance, and  \nconsideration — and find out when promises are  \nenforceable even if parties haven’t met the requirements \nto form a contract.",2441

14-Grasping the Concept of Contract Law.pdf,14-Grasping the Concept of Contract Law,"Chapter 1\nGetting the Lowdown  \non Contract Law\nIn This Chapter\n▶ Wrapping your brain around the concept of contract law\n▶ Grasping the fundamental rules and principles that govern contracts\n▶ Understanding contract formation, defenses, and interpretation\n▶ Getting up to speed on performance, breach, and remedies\nC \nontract law may feel overwhelming, especially when you’re in a class \nthat reads and analyzes case after case after case. Adding to that \nload are the many sources of contract law, including the common law, the \nRestatement of Contracts (Restatement), the Uniform Commercial Code \n(UCC), federal and state statutes, and rules that govern when parties are \nallowed or prohibited from coming up with their own contract terms.\nAlthough all the details swirling around the topic of contract law are important, \nplacing those details in context makes them more manageable and enables you \nto see the big picture. That’s what this chapter is all about. Here, you get the eye-\nin-the-sky view of contract law and a framework on which to hang the rich tapes -\ntry of policies, principles, and rules collectively referred to as contract law.\nGrasping the Concept of Contract Law\nContrary to popular belief, contract law isn’t just a bunch of rules and regu -\nlations that govern agreements between people. It’s not developed and \nimposed from above by some rule-making authority. It developed naturally \nover the course of thousands of years through the interactions and transac -\ntions between people like you and me — the parties who form contracts.\nIn this section, I explain what a contract is, present a few different perspec -\ntives on the principles that should drive the formation of contract rules, and \nbriefly explore how contract law developed into what it is today.\n10 Part I: Introducing Contract Law and Contract Formation \nDefining contract\nA contract  is simply a promise or set of promises enforceable by law. Which \nagreements are enforceable by law varies from culture to culture — what’s \nacceptable in one culture may not be acceptable in another. If I agree to sell \nyou my house, for example, the house-selling culture says that I can’t make \nany untruthful statements about the house. But if I agree to play a hand in the \nWorld Series of Poker, then the poker culture says that I can’t make any truth-\nful statements about my hand.\nThe United States doesn’t have a monolithic contract law with uniform rules. \nContract law is nuanced and fact intensive. A “rule” may differ, for example, \ndepending on whether the parties are two giant corporations having their \nlawyers negotiate an agreement or family members making an agreement \nover the dinner table.\nComparing different schools  \nof thought on contract rules\nThe overriding principles that guide the formation of contract rules vary \naccording to different schools of thought. Depending on your perspective, \nyou may think that the rules should be based on what isFrom coconuts to contracts: Grasping  \nthe purpose of contracts\nTo begin to grasp what contract law is all about, \nimagine a group of people on a desert island \ntrying to figure out ways to govern their rela -\ntionships. They want to be a community, but \nthey also want each person to have autonomy. \nCollectively, they decide that each person may \nown property and make agreements about \nwhat to do with that property. They discover \nthat the free exchange of property increases \nthe wealth and well-being of both parties; for \nexample, if one person has a surplus of coco -\nnuts and a shortage of fish and another person has a surplus of fish but no coconuts, the two \nmay exchange goods for their mutual benefit.\nIf the parties take the next step and decide that \nthey can promise in advance to perform such \nexchanges, their agreement indicates the begin -\nnings of contract law. As certain issues arise, the \nislanders form rules that address those issues, \nsuch as how quickly the parties must perform, the \nacceptable quality of the coconuts and fish, and \nthe consequences for nonperformance. Their \nsystem of contract law grows organically from \nthe ground up, not from the top down.\n11  Chapter 1: Getting the Lowdown on Contract Law\n ✓ Customary and reasonable:  In most systems of contract law, the rule \nthat develops is usually based on what’s customary and reasonable. \nWith nearly every issue that arises in contract law, just think about \nwhat’s reasonable, and you’ll usually discover the “rule.”\n ✓ Economically efficient:  My economist friends think that rules should be \nbased on what’s most economically efficient. According to the econo -\nmists, people enter contracts for their mutual financial benefit; for exam -\nple, you agree to sell and I agree to buy your car for $7,000, because right \nnow, the $7,000 is worth more to you than the car, and the car is worth \nmore to me than the $7,000 I have in my piggy bank. Throughout this \nbook, I sometimes share the economist’s perspective, but if you haven’t \nstudied Econ (or read Economics For Dummies  [Wiley]), stick with asking \nwhat’s reasonable and you’ll come up with the rule most of the time.\n ✓ Fair for the little guy:  According to my friends in the Critical Studies \nmovement, the people in power, who happened to be rich white men, \nmade the rules. The rich guys came up with rules that are favorable to \nthem, so contract law needs to watch out for the little guy, who gets the \nworst of it in contracts.\nRegardless of view, everyone would probably agree that one of the most difficult \nproblems facing contract law today is the ease with which consumers can bind \nthemselves to contracts by clicking I AGREE to the “terms and conditions” that \nnobody reads. This is quite different from the contract created by a carefully \nnegotiated exchange of drafts. Or is it? Throughout your career in contract law, \nyou’ll struggle to determine whether the same rules apply to both situations.\nTracing contract law’s roots\nMost contract law in the United States comes from England, where it was \nlargely based on the tradition commonly referred to as the common law,  \nmeaning the law made by judges. Many of the rules of commercial law that \ngovern buying, selling, and financing come from medieval times. Anytime par -\nties traded, they had to have an understanding of the deal they were making. \nThey made their own rules, called the law merchant,  to govern their situation.\nAs the law became more specialized, various areas of contract law were spun \noff and now stand on their own. Insurance law, banking law, and government \nprocurement law are all areas of contract law that you don’t study in a standard \nContracts course. One authority has called contract law “the law of leftovers” — \ngeneral principles that remain irrespective of the substance of the transaction.",6918
15-Meeting the Key Players Common Law the Restatement and the UCC.pdf,15-Meeting the Key Players Common Law the Restatement and the UCC,"12 Part I: Introducing Contract Law and Contract Formation \nMeeting the Key Players: Common Law, \nthe Restatement, and the UCC\nAlthough you’ll find no definitive collection of the rules and regulations that \ngovern contracts, you can find guidance from three primary resources: the \ncommon law, the Restatement of Contracts, and the Uniform Commercial \nCode (UCC, or the Code). I refer to these resources throughout the book, so \nyou need to have a general understanding of how each resource contributes \nto contract law.\nExploring the common law:  \nTradition and precedent\nIn the Anglo-American (meaning English and American) tradition, contract \nlaw was common law  — judges decided each dispute on the basis of tradition \nand recorded precedent. Imagine yourself the lord of the manor in Merrie \nOlde England, and the parties to a dispute look to you for wisdom. You’d \nlikely ask, “What have we done in the past? Does it make sense today?” —  \nthe same questions today’s judges ask!\nIn a common-law system, if you want to find out what the outcome is likely \nto be under a particular fact pattern, you have to read all the applicable \ncases (the reported court decisions) and synthesize them. That’s what you \ndo in your legal research and writing class and you sometimes do in your \nContracts class when you have a string of cases to read. You don’t read them \nin isolation; you try to see the connections and be prepared to say why one \ncase came out one way and one came out another way.\n Because of the common-law rule of stare decisis  (“let the decision stand”), \ncourts generally follow precedent. Therefore, you can fairly accurately predict \nwhat a court will do in the future based on what courts have done in the past. \nBecause that predictive power is important to businesses entering transac -\ntions, contract law is slow to change.\nCapturing general rules in the Restatement\nAlthough the common-law approach is effective, sometimes you just want to \nknow what the general rule is, devoid of any particular fact situation. Having \nto read all the cases on point to find a rule would be a pain. Fortunately, \nsomeone has always been willing to read all those cases and try to synthesize \nthem into black-letter rules  — attempts to capture the essence of each rule. \nIn the 18th century, that someone was Sir William Blackstone, who wrote \nCommentaries on the Laws of England  (1765–1769). In those days, lawyers, \n13  Chapter 1: Getting the Lowdown on Contract Law\nincluding many of our Founding Fathers, relied on Blackstone for this pur -\npose. Now contract law has the Restatement.\nThe Restatements of Law  are an effort by the American Law Institute (a group of \nlaw professors, lawyers, judges, and other interested parties) to reduce the law \nto workable sets of black-letter rules. The First Restatement of Contracts came \nout in 1932. The principal reporter was Samuel Williston, who wrote one of the \ngreat multivolume treatises on contract law. The rules in this Restatement are \nsomewhat rigid and don’t always reflect modern legal thinking, which often takes \ninto consideration a number of mushy factors instead of drawing bright lines.\n A Second Restatement of Contracts was promulgated in 1981, with Allan \nFarnsworth as reporter. When I refer to “the Restatement,” I mean the  \nSecond Restatement.\nAlthough the Restatement is a great resource, recognize its limitations:\n ✓ It’s not enacted law, so it has only persuasive authority. If you’re citing \nlaw to a judge, the judge wants to know what the higher courts in that \njurisdiction have held, not what the Restatement says.\n ✓ It represents a limited number of views. People hold conflicting views \nof what should be the rule, with some jurisdictions following one line \nof reasoning and others following another. The Restatement generally \nchooses the majority view in this situation, so you may get the misim -\npression from its statement of a rule that the law is more settled than \nit is. And on a few occasions, the Restatement states the minority view \nbecause the drafters thought it represented the better view.\n  Many publications of the Restatement for students contain only the \nrules. The complete edition includes commentaries and illustrations  \nto help you more fully understand each rule.\nStatutes: Supplanting common  \nlaw with codes\nAlthough contract law is traditionally common law, statutes enacted by legis -\nlatures are increasingly taking over the role of common law. The courts have \nto follow the laws enacted by the legislature, so if the law has a statute on \npoint, that should be the starting point for a court.\nAs you’re probably aware, many European countries have civil law systems \nbased largely on systematic arrangements of statutes called codes.  Such \nsystems have an authoritative source to go to in order to find the govern -\ning contract law. Louisiana, because of its French origins, has a civil code of \nContracts, and so do many other states.\n14 Part I: Introducing Contract Law and Contract Formation \nIn the mid-19th century, a “codification” movement in England and the U.S. \nsought to codify the law in order to make it more accessible, and the codifiers \nwon out in a number of states, including California, which has codified the law \nof Contracts in its Civil Code. But these codes often just state common-law \nrules and principles, leaving the courts plenty of room to interpret the statute \nand apply it to a particular situation.\n Contract law is mostly state law rather than federal law. Although no federal \ncommon law of contracts exists, a number of federal statutes govern con -\ntracts. Most of these are in the consumer and credit areas, so when you have \na transaction in these areas, check for any relevant federal statutes.\nBrushing up on the Uniform  \nCommercial Code (UCC)\nIf each state had the same statutes governing contracts, then the law would be \neasier to find and more predictable, which is especially important in commer -\ncial law that applies to many interstate transactions. Congress could probably \nenact an American Commercial Code based on its authority to regulate inter -\nstate commerce, but Congress has left this project to the states. The states \nhave turned to the assistance of the Uniform Law Commission (ULC) — a pri -\nvate group with representatives from every state that aspires to write model \nstatutes that get the law right and that are enactable.\n When the ULC agrees on a model statute, the process is only just beginning, \nbecause the model statute isn’t yet law. State legislatures must enact the stat -\nutes for them to become law.\nThe ULC, with the assistance of the American Law Institute (the folks respon -\nsible for the Restatements) has had great success getting states to enact \nthe Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which contains a number of Articles \naddressing various aspects of commercial law. Karl Llewellyn first drafted this \nmodel statute in the 1940s, and states began to enact it in the 1960s. Article 2, \nwhich deals with the sale of goods, is the Article most relevant to contract law.\nVarying the model statutes in state laws\nThe ULC is frequently unable to achieve its goal of uniformity, because states \ncan and often do alter the Uniform version. So although every state has enacted \nthe UCC (Louisiana has not enacted Article 2), they’ve all enacted slightly differ -\nent versions. In this book, I generally cite the North Carolina version, not out of \nsome love for the First-in-Flight state but because the Uniform version is under \ncopyright, whereas an enacted statute is in the public domain.\n In your law studies, you’ll probably be working with the Restatement and the \nUniform version of the UCC as promulgated by the ULC. But remember, when \n15  Chapter 1: Getting the Lowdown on Contract Law\nyou have a research question in a certain jurisdiction, you need to look up the \nlaw in that state to make sure that it’s the same.\nNote: Attempts to revise UCC Article 2 have come to an end, but  Article 1 \nunderwent a revision process in 2001. Most states have enacted Revised \nArticle 1, which is also used on the Multistate Bar Exam, so that’s the version \nof Article 1 that I refer to. Again, when doing research in a jurisdiction, you \nmust find out which is the applicable law in your jurisdiction.\nLooking at some important UCC principles\nAlthough UCC Article 2 gets the most press in this book, you also encounter \nreferences to UCC Article 1, which deals with basic principles and definitions \nthat apply throughout the Code, including Article 2.\nSome of the basic principles found in Article 1 are so important that I cite \nthem repeatedly. I discuss two of the most significant provisions next.\nFreedom of contract: Letting parties agree to a different rule\nOne important principle of UCC Article 1 is what I call the freedom of contract \nprovision.  Section 1-302(a), as enacted in North Carolina at 25-1-302(a), pro -\nvides the following:\n§ 25-1-302. Variation by agreement.\n(a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) of this section or else -\nwhere in [the Uniform Commercial Code], the effect of provisions of [the \nUniform Commercial Code] may be varied by agreement.\nThis important rule offers guidance on how to think of “the law.” Contract \nlaw is not a bunch of regulations that parties to a contract must follow. Often, \ncontract law facilitates a transaction by providing a rule that kicks in if the \nparties neglect to provide their own rule. These rules are often called default \nrules  because, like the default settings on your computer, they apply unless \nyou change them. But very often, as UCC § 1-302(a) states, contract law gives \nthe parties the freedom of contract to come up with their own rule. Some of \nthe rules are regulatory, and unfortunately the Code isn’t always helpful in \nidentifying whether a particular rule is regulatory (can’t be changed) or  \nfacilitatory (can be changed by the parties’ mutual agreement).\nNote, for example, that § 1-302(b) states some obligations that the parties can’t \nget out of by agreement. But that same provision goes on to say that you can \n“determine standards by which the performance of those obligations is to be \nmeasured.” You can’t, for example, agree not to be reasonable, but you can \nagree, “It is to be considered reasonable if we do A, B, and C.” Figuring out the \ninterplay between what is permissible in some circumstances and not permis -\nsible in others is one of the greatest challenges in studying contract law.\n16 Part I: Introducing Contract Law and Contract Formation \n As you study Contracts, try to identify which are the regulatory rules that \nhave to be followed and which are the facilitatory rules that the parties are \nfree to change. Take a nuanced view. If the court doesn’t let the parties change \nthe rule, ask why — was it because the parties were in a particular state? \nEntered into a particular kind of transaction? Had an imbalance of power?\nSupplementing the UCC with common law\nAnother important provision in Article 1 is § 1-103(b), which points out that \nthe Code is not the exclusive law applicable to a transaction. As enacted in \nNorth Carolina at § 25-1-103(b), it provides the following:\n(b) Unless displaced by the particular provisions of this Chapter  \n[the Uniform Commercial Code], the principles of law and equity [. . .] \nsupplement its provisions.\nThis rule makes clear that the Code doesn’t address every topic, and where \nit’s incomplete, courts will fill in gaps in the Code with rules derived from the \ncommon law. For example, the Code says very little about the defenses to \ncontract formation that I explain in Chapters 5 through 7 of this book. Section \n1-103(b) says that in a case involving the sale of goods, those defenses apply, \nbut you have to look to the common law to see what they are.\nApplying state law in federal court\nMany contracts cases are heard in federal court. Most of those cases got \nthere on the jurisdictional basis of diversity  — under federal law, parties who \nare citizens of different states are allowed to use the federal courts if the \namount of money at issue is over a certain dollar amount set by Congress. \nIn such cases, the federal court uses the principles of Choice of Law (as I \nexplain in Chapter 18) to decide which state’s law governs the transaction. \nThe federal court is in effect sitting as the state’s highest court and asking, \n“What would the judges on that court do in this situation?”\n Whenever you see that a contracts case is in federal court, ask how that court \ngot jurisdiction. If the answer is diversity, then identify the state whose law \nthe court is applying. If the court got jurisdiction in some other way — for \nexample, because it’s a matter of admiralty law  (law on the high seas) or \nbecause the United States is a party — then the court follows general prin -\nciples of contract law rather than the law of any particular state.\n Be careful when you research contract law questions, particularly online. Your \nsearch results for the decisions of a particular state often include federal court \ndecisions from the circuit in which the state is located. But you have to read \nthe federal court decision carefully to find out which state’s law it’s applying. \nIf it’s not applying the law of your state, the federal court isn’t a very good \nauthority. And even if the court applies your state’s laws, remember that the \nfederal court decision is only persuasive authority in your state.\n17  Chapter 1: Getting the Lowdown on Contract Law\nApplying different sources of contract law\nWhen you look at a contract case, you often need to consider several differ -\nent sources of contract laws, including common law, the Restatement, the \nUCC, and federal and state statutes.\n Suppose a client in Montana purchased a wheelchair for personal use and the \nseller refuses to fix it, even though it came with a warranty. Is she entitled to \nrelief? At first glance, the case seems pretty simple, but it gets complicated in \na hurry when you start to consider all sources of law that may come into play, \nwhich include the following:\n ✓ Federal consumer protection law, because the case involves a consumer\n ✓ The federal Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, because it involves a warranty\n ✓ Montana UCC Article 2, because it involves the sale of goods\n ✓ The Montana Wheelchair Warranty Act, a statute that specifically \naddresses this transaction\n ✓ State consumer protection statutes and other relevant statutes\n ✓ General principles of contract law in Montana, found both in statutes \nand in casesInferring a state rule that makes little sense\nWhen federal courts take a contract case on \nthe basis of diversity, the federal courts defer \nto state law, regardless of whether they agree \nwith it. A good example of how this plays out in \nthe real world is in the case of Northrop Corp. \nv. Litronic Industries,  29 F.3d 1173 (7th Cir. 1994).\nIn this case, Judge Richard Posner of the 7th \ncircuit Federal Court of Appeals was given \nthe task of ruling on a case where Illinois law \napplied. The rule in issue had three possible \ninterpretations, but the Illinois courts had not \nyet expressed their opinion on the matter. \nAlthough Judge Posner preferred the view \nadopted only in California, his job was to try \nto figure out how the courts in Illinois would \ndecide the case.Judge Posner concluded that Illinois would \nprobably not agree with his preferred view and \nsaid in effect, We are hearing this case because \nof diversity, and Illinois law applies. Illinois \nwould likely follow a rule that makes less sense, \nbut I am going to have to hold my nose and go \nalong with the state rule because that is what a \nfederal judge has to do in a diversity case.\nYou might think it would make more sense for \nthe federal court judges to ask the state court \njudges what they would do, and many states \nhave a procedure for doing that. Sometimes \nwhen the state has insufficient precedent, the \nstate court takes a “certified question” from the \nfederal court in order to assist the federal court \nin resolving a dispute.",16369

To the extent \nthe federal and state law is regulatory, the contract would have to follow \nthat law, but to the extent it’s facilitatory, the parties would be free to \nprovide their own rules.)\nIf you like solving puzzles like this, welcome to the world of contracts!\nForming, Defending, and Interpreting \nContracts: The Basics\nKnowing the rules that govern contracts is only half the battle. You have to be \nable to apply those rules to different situations. Because contract law is so fact \ndependent, it’s always coming up with exceptions to the rules to deal with par -\nticular circumstances. No book covers all the possible variables and exceptions, \nbut knowing the rules and the principles behind them gives you a firm founda -\ntion to build on. This section provides a framework for understanding Contracts.\n Look at the big picture. Doing so may be difficult because no one agrees on  \na single best way to organize the study of Contracts. The topics are like a  \ndeck of cards that you can shuffle up and deal in various ways. Whether you \nstart with remedies or with consideration, what’s important is seeing how  \nthe pieces all fit together.A word about international law and the CISG\nUniformity is helpful in governing both inter -\nstate and international transactions. More \nthan 70 countries, including the United States, \nhave adopted the United Nations Convention \non Contracts for the International Sale of \nGoods (CISG). By default, the CISG applies to \ntransactions for the sale of goods between \nbusinesses located in countries that have \nadopted it. You can find the text of the CISG \nat www.uncitral.org/uncitral/  \nen/uncitral_texts/sale_goods/  \n1980CISG.html .Many U.S. lawyers contract around application \nof the CISG by putting in their international con -\ntracts a choice of law provision (see Chapter 18) \nspecifying that the UCC of a particular state gov -\nerns the agreement. Other lawyers, particularly in \ncontracts that contain an arbitration clause (see \nChapter 18), specify that the UNIDROIT Principles \nof International Commercial Contracts will apply. \nFor the text of the UNIDROIT Principles, promul -\ngated by the International Chamber of Commerce, \nvisit www.unidroit.org/english/\nprinciples/contracts/main.htm .\n19  Chapter 1: Getting the Lowdown on Contract Law\nUnderstanding contract formation\nEvery contract starts at the point of formation. As I explain in Chapters 2  \nand 3, a contract  is a bargained-for exchange that requires the following  \nthree ingredients:\n ✓ Offer:  Party A’s promise to Party B in exchange for something\n ✓ Acceptance:  Party B’s assent to Party A’s offer\n ✓ Consideration:  What each party offers in exchange for the other  \nparty’s promise\nIf the parties didn’t form a contract (because one of the essential ingredients \nwas missing), that may not be the end of the story. Based on the theories of \nreliance and restitution (see Chapter 4), even in the absence of a contract, \nparties may be required by law to compensate another party because they \nmade a promise or received a benefit:\n ✓ Reliance:  If one person relies on another person’s promise, the prom -\nise may be enforceable even in the absence of a bargain. For example, I \npromise to give you my car when you graduate, and you pass up another \nfree-car offer as a result. I may be required to compensate you for your \nloss. Contract law uses reliance to restore the injured party to the posi -\ntion she was in before she relied on the promise.\n ✓ Restitution:  If Party A confers a benefit on Party B without forcing it on \nher and without intending it as a gift, then even though Party B never \noffered consideration in exchange for that benefit, Party A may have a \nright to receive restitution. Contract law uses restitution to make the \nbenefitted party give up the benefit, restoring her to the position she \nwas in before the benefit was conferred.\nChecking out attack and defense maneuvers\nWhen a deal fulfills the requirements of offer, acceptance, and consider -\nation, the agreement is presumptively an enforceable contract, but either \nparty may challenge the contract via a contract defense,  otherwise known \nas a defense to formation.  A party may base its contract defense on different \ngrounds, such as the characteristics of one of the parties (under the age of 18 \nor having impaired judgment), something one party did to the other (fraud, \nduress, or undue influence), or something wrong with the contract itself \n(mutual mistake, illegality, unconscionability, or an oral contract when the \nlaw requires the contract to be evidenced by a writing). Chapter 5 introduces \ncontract defenses, and Chapters 6 through 8 discuss the specifics.",5047
17-Examining Contract Performance Breach and Remedies.pdf,17-Examining Contract Performance Breach and Remedies,"20 Part I: Introducing Contract Law and Contract Formation \nFinding the terms of the contract and \nbuilding contract-interpretation skills\nA contract rarely contains a comprehensive list of terms the parties agreed \nto, nor does it provide for everything that might happen in the future. If the \ncontract is indefinite or incomplete, contract law provides ways to clarify \nthe terms and fill the gaps. If the agreement is part written and part oral, con -\ntract law uses the parol evidence rule to determine which unwritten terms to \ninclude. Some terms not included in the contract may need to be added due \nto course of performance  (a history of how the parties acted under the pres -\nent agreement), course of dealing  (how the parties performed under other, \nsimilar contracts), or trade usage  (how other parties in the industry perform). \nFinally, even after finding all the terms, the parties may have a disagreement \nregarding interpretation of unclear language in the contract. Chapters 9 \nthrough 11 address these issues.\nExamining Contract Performance, \nBreach, and Remedies\nAfter parties form a contract, the parties must perform  (do what they prom -\nised to do). If a party doesn’t perform and she’s in breach, then contract law \nmust determine a just remedy for the breach — usually an amount of money \nsufficient to compensate the non-breaching party for what he lost as a result \nof the breach. This section explores breach, remedies for breach, and the \nrole of third parties.\nRecognizing breach of contract\nBreach of contract is a deceptively easy concept to grasp — it means that the \nparty didn’t keep his promise. Sometimes, however, a party who didn’t keep \nhis promise may actually not be in breach, as in the following situations:\n ✓ The parties didn’t actually have a contract.  One of the best and most \ncommon responses to an allegation of breach of contract is to launch \na contract defense to try to prove that contract formation never hap -\npened. A party accused of breach may say, “Ha-ha! I can’t be in breach \nbecause we never had a contract!”\n ✓ The parties modified the contract, omitting the promise.  See Chapter 12 \nfor details on making changes to a contract.\n21  Chapter 1: Getting the Lowdown on Contract Law\n ✓ Performance was excused.  Performance may be excused because of an \nunanticipated event that prevented it or because performance was con -\nditional and the condition never occurred. The most common condition \nis the other party’s performance: The claim is that if you didn’t perform, \nthen I don’t have to perform. See Chapters 13 and 14 for details on cir -\ncumstances that excuse performance.\n ✓ The other party repudiated prior to the performance deadline.  One of \nthe other parties may have made an anticipatory repudiation  — telling \nthe other party in advance of the time for performance that he doesn’t \nplan to perform the contract and thus letting the non-repudiating party \noff the hook. Chapter 15 covers anticipatory repudiation.\nFormulating remedies and  \nestablishing losses\nIf parties have a contract and one party breaches, then the injured, non-\nbreaching party is entitled to a remedy. The goal here is to give the injured \nparty the expectancy  — the position the party would’ve been in had the con -\ntract been performed. In addition to the expectancy, reliance and restitution \ncome back as two additional remedies for breach. Chapters 16 to 18 cover \nthe various remedies in greater detail.\n In contract law, the principal remedy, the expectancy, puts the non-breaching \nparty where she would’ve been had the contract been performed, not back \nwhere she was before the contract was formed.\nExploring the role of third  \nparties in contract law\nThird parties are people who aren’t parties to the contract but who are \naffected by it in some way. They may be third-party beneficiaries  of the con -\ntract (they stand to receive something), or they may have rights assigned or \nduties delegated to them by parties to the contract. Contracts classes rarely \ncover the role of third parties in contract law, but this is an important topic \nin the real world. Chapters 19 and 20 explain what you need to know.",4246
18-Chapter 2 Lets Make a Deal Offer and Acceptance.pdf,18-Chapter 2 Lets Make a Deal Offer and Acceptance,"22 Part I: Introducing Contract Law and Contract Formation \nPracticing in the Real World of Contracts\nGetting lost in the study of Contracts or any legal subject is easy. The rules \nkeep piling up, you can’t keep them all straight, and pretty soon you’re \ndrowning under them. Take a deep breath and try to see the big picture  \nas I present it in this chapter.\nMost contract issues are solved through negotiation, not litigation, so con -\ntract lawyers, especially the most skillful of them, rarely see the inside of a \ncourtroom. As you’re studying case after case — the way Contracts is typi -\ncally taught — fight the urge to become overly litigation-oriented and bogged \ndown in minutiae.\n Use your skills to see how you can use contract law in planning and drafting \nagreements. Contracts then becomes a matter of preventive law: Having read \nhow people screwed up in past cases, you’re going to get it right so you and \nyour clients don’t end up in court. When you think of Contracts as planning \nand drafting, you appreciate more the principle of freedom of contract. If you \nknow the rules, then you’re better able to draft around them.",1161
19-Forming a Contract Promises Offers and Mutual Assent.pdf,19-Forming a Contract Promises Offers and Mutual Assent,"Chapter 2\nLet’s Make a Deal:  \nOffer and Acceptance\nIn This Chapter\n▶ Recognizing the three requirements of contract formation\n▶ Making a contract through offer and acceptance\n▶ Gauging the time an offer stays open and whether and when the offeror can back out\n▶ Knowing how to proceed when the parties exchange different forms\nA \n contract  is a promise or set of promises enforceable by law. The waters \nget a little murky, however, when you begin to explore how the law \ndetermines whether parties have formed a contract. Questions arise, such as \nWhat constitutes an offer? Did the offeree signal acceptance? Was the offer still \nopen when the acceptance occurred?\nQuestions also arise regarding the manner and method of acceptance. Was \nthe agreement formed by promise  (a commitment to do something) or per-\nformance  (actually doing something)? Does clicking the Agree button on a \nwebsite or entering an electronic signature count as acceptance? What if the \nparty on the receiving end of a form offer signals acceptance with a form of \nher own, complete with additional or different terms? This chapter answers \nthese questions and more.\nContract Formation: Getting  \na Handle on the Essentials\nIn the Anglo-American legal system, a contract is binding if it fulfills the  \nfollowing three contract formation requirements:\n ✓ Offer:  One party (the offeror ) promises the other party (the offeree ) \nsomething in return for something else. To legally qualify as an offer, it \nmust specify what the offeror wants in return.\n24 Part I: Introducing Contract Law and Contract Formation \n  Don’t let the -or and -ee suffixes confuse you. Just remember that the -or \nis on the giving end, as in promisor  (the party making the promise), and \nthe -ee is on the receiving end, as in promisee  (the party to whom the \npromise is made).\n ✓ Acceptance:  The offeree gives the offeror whatever was requested in  \nthe offer.\n ✓ Consideration:  The consideration is whatever each party brings to the \ntable. For example, if I contract with you to be your attorney, you bring \nmoney, and I bring my services.\nMix all three ingredients, and you have a contract. The rest of this chapter \nexplains how to determine whether the requirements of offer and acceptance \nhave been satisfied. Chapter 3 tackles the third requirement: consideration.\n A contract signals the end of “just talk” and the beginning of serious busi -\nness. After a contract is made, if a dispute arises, one party can take the other \nto court to seek enforcement. Contract formation is all about distinguishing \nbetween “just talk” and the binding commitment that has legal ramifications.\nForming a Contract: Promises,  \nOffers, and Mutual Assent\nIt takes two parties to make a contract. A party  is a person or entity who \nagrees to be bound by the contract. (See how much fun contract law can What’s binding? It’s a cultural thing\nEach culture may draw the line between non -\nbinding talk and binding commitments in a dif -\nferent place. In theory, a society could treat all \npromises as legally enforceable. Five-year-olds \nseem to live in such a culture — they scream, \n“But, Mommy, you promised,”  as though that \nalone were sufficient to require enforcement. \nOther societies may make entering into an \nenforceable agreement very difficult. A few \nhundred years ago, English society required that \nyou put a seal on a document to make it binding.\nFortunately for the practice of international \nlaw, most societies accept written agreements signed by both parties as a sufficient indication \nof intent to make a binding commitment, but \nexceptions do exist. The counsel for a multina -\ntional company recently told me about a deal he \nmade in which the other country’s law required \nthat both parties sign every page and have the \nsigning witnessed by a team of notaries.\nCurrently in the U.S. and elsewhere, electronic \ncontracting challenges the tradition of signing \ncontracts by hand. Society must now determine \nhow parties can form binding contracts in the \nculture of cyberspace.\n25  Chapter 2: Let’s Make a Deal: Offer and Acceptance\nbe? One person is a party!) Part VI explains how a third party,  one who’s not \nbound by the contract, may become involved.\nTo make a contract, both parties must give their mutual assent;  that is, they \nmust willingly agree to the terms of the contract. To determine whether the \nparties have formed a contract, you must carefully examine the facts to find \nassent by both parties. This section describes how parties give their assent \nand reveals that not all promises are legally binding commitments.\nMaking a commitment  \nby making a promise\nA promise  is a commitment to do or not to do something, regardless of \nwhether the word promise  is actually used. So to determine whether a party \nhas made a promise, look for the commitment behind the words.\n For example, if Joe says to Mary, “I promise to give you $200 tomorrow,” that’s \na commitment; Joe has pledged to do something. If Mary says to Joe, “I’ll \ngive you my bicycle tomorrow,” that’s also a commitment, even though Mary \ndidn’t utter the word promise.\nWhen one person promises something to another as in this example, it’s a gift \npromise. It may be morally binding, but it’s not legally binding. To become \nlegally binding, the promise must be accompanied by a request for some -\nthing in return, as I explain in the next section.\nTurning a promise into an offer by  \nasking for something in return\nTo turn a gift promise into an offer,  add the condition that the offeree must \ndo or give something in return. That something  can be either a promise (a \ncommitment to do something) or a performance (actually doing something).\n When Joe says to Mary, “I promise to give you $200 tomorrow,” that’s just a \ngift promise. But if Joe says to Mary, “I promise to give you $200 tomorrow if \nyou promise to give me your bicycle tomorrow,” now he’s made an offer. He’s \npromised to do something but only if she promises to do something in return.\nNote:  To my economist friends, contracts are exchanges that maximize  util-\nity — the usefulness of whatever the parties agree to exchange. Joe makes his \noffer because Mary’s bicycle is more useful for him than is his $200. If Mary \ncan make better use of the $200 than she can her bicycle, she’s likely to agree \nto the exchange. With both parties better off than they were, the exchange \nhas increased the sum total of human happiness. It’s a win-win situation.  \nWay to go, Contracts!\n26 Part I: Introducing Contract Law and Contract Formation \nGiving acceptance by giving or agreeing \nto give what was requested in return\nAcceptance occurs when the offeree gives or agrees to give the offeror what -\never he asked for in return for his promise (see the section “Acceptance must \nmatch the offer: The mirror-image rule,” later in this chapter). As with the \noffer, the acceptance requires no formal language. If Joe offers to buy Mary’s \nbicycle for $200 and she says, “It’s a deal!” that’s all it takes. At that very \nmoment, Boom! — a contract falls from the sky.\n Don’t make the mistake of confusing contract formation with contract perfor -\nmance. As soon as Joe presents his offer and Mary accepts it, they’ve formed \na contract. If Joe comes to get the bicycle the next day and Mary says, “Ha-ha! \nI changed my mind. I’m not selling you my bicycle,” then she has breached the \ncontract. See Part IV for info on breach of contract.\nAssenting in action or thought: Objective \nmanifestation versus subjective intent\nOne of the great debates in contract law revolves around whether assent  \nis found in the parties’ subjective intent to form a contract or in their  \nobjective manifestations:\n ✓ Subjective intent:  What the parties were thinking  when they formed  \nthe contract\n ✓ Objective manifestation:  What the parties did, such as their words or \ntheir outward expressions\nMeeting of the minds? Nonsense!\nCourts sometimes speak of the need for a \n“meeting of the minds” in order to estab -\nlish the intent to be legally bound. But courts \ndon’t really mean that. Because they don’t \nknow whether the minds actually met, judges \nlook for words or conduct that a disinterested \n(impartial) observer would regard as indicating \nagreement to the contract. Such words or con -\nduct constitute the “objective manifestation of \nassent” that can bind the parties.Don’t describe assent by using that offensive \nexpression (which I refuse to repeat here, \nbecause I don’t want to encourage you to \nsay it). Instead, say that a contract requires \nan “objective manifestation of assent.” This \ndoesn’t exactly roll off your tongue as easily as \nthat other expression, but that’s how you should \nsay it and how judges should, too.\n27  Chapter 2: Let’s Make a Deal: Offer and Acceptance\nVerifying what’s going on in someone’s mind is impossible, so courts look for \nassent in the objective manifestations of the parties, not in their intent. This \nsection explains how the objective theory of assent plays out in practice and \nhighlights its importance.\nSeeing objective manifestation in practice\nThe reason I use so many examples in explaining Contracts is that the rules \nmean something only in context, and seeing a rule applied in different con -\ntexts is how you come to understand the law in action. This section contains \ntwo examples of how objective manifestation of assent plays out in practice: \nIn one example, someone claims the agreement was a joke, and in the other, \nsomeone makes an inadvertent arm movement at an auction.\n Suppose that the day after Mary agreed to sell her bicycle to Joe, she has a \nchange of heart and says, “I didn’t really mean it when I said, ‘It’s a deal.’ I  \nwas just joking.” Mary is claiming that no contract was formed because in  \nher mind, she didn’t intend her words to be taken seriously.\nUnfortunately for Mary, contract law isn’t concerned with what was or wasn’t in \nher head but with her objective manifestations. The question is not whether she \nthought she was serious — that would involve looking at subjective thoughts. \nThe question is whether a reasonable person standing in Joe’s shoes would’ve \nthought she was serious by looking at her objective manifestations — whether \nshe appeared to be serious when she spoke the words. If the answer is yes, then \nbased on the objective theory of assent, Mary is bound to the contract even if in \nher heart of hearts she was joking.\n A TV commercial for a dandruff shampoo contained a wonderful example \nof the objective theory of assent. The setting is an auction, which is a great \nplace to explore contract-formation essentials and the nuances of assent. The \nauctioneer opens the bidding by saying, “Who will give $2,000 for a date with \nsupermodel Cindy?” A guy in the audience lifts his paddle with #18 on it in \norder to use it to scratch his head. The auctioneer immediately slams down \nhis gavel and says, “Sold to number 18 for $2,000!”\nAs soon as the auctioneer opens the bidding, he’s inviting bids or offers from \nthe attendees. As soon as the guy in the audience lifts his paddle, which \neveryone knows is how you enter a bid, he has made his offer. When the auc -\ntioneer brings his hammer down and says, “Sold!” that’s acceptance.\nThe commercial ends there, but imagine the winning bidder’s response: “Hey, \nwait a minute. I didn’t intend to make an offer — my intention was to scratch \nmy head.” But contract law would say, “Sorry. We don’t care what your \nsubjective intention was. You objectively manifested your assent when you \nraised the paddle. A reasonable person in the shoes of the auctioneer would \nthink you had made an offer, and he accepted it, so a contract was formed!”\n28 Part I: Introducing Contract Law and Contract Formation \nAppreciating the importance of objective manifestation of assent\nThe theory of objective manifestation of assent has significant consequences. \nBecause a contract is formed objectively, whether a party reads or under -\nstands it is irrelevant. For example, if I sign a ten-page contract and then \nclaim no contract was formed because I never read it or didn’t understand it, \nI’d have no case. The court would look for objective manifestation of assent \nand find it in my signature.\nSimilarly, when I travel to Uruguay and rent a car, I have to sign a rental \nagreement that’s written in Spanish. Claiming that no contract was formed, I \nmight say, “No hablo español!” But contract law would point to my signature \non the contract and respond, “¡Manifestación objetiva de consentimiento \nmutuo!” which translates to “Objective manifestation of assent!”\nObjective manifestation of assent also comes into play with online contracts. \nThe offeree usually has an opportunity to read the Terms and Conditions but \nskips that part and clicks the Agree button or its equivalent. That qualifies as \nan objective manifestation of assent.\n Although objective manifestation seals the deal, it doesn’t necessarily mean \nthat the contract is enforceable. In some cases, the offeror, knowing that the \nofferee won’t read or understand the contract, slips one-sided terms into it to Leonard v. Pepsico:  Collecting for a jet\nIn the case of Leonard v. Pepsico,  Pepsi issued \na catalog of items a person could buy with \nPepsi Points. Consumers could buy Pepsi prod -\nucts to earn points, and although people had to \nsubmit a minimum of 15 Pepsi Points with their \norder, they could purchase additional points \nfor 10 cents each. To advertise the promotion, \nPepsi ran a commercial in which a teenager is \nbuying all sorts of stuff with Pepsi points — a \nT-shirt for 75 points, a leather jacket for 1,450 \npoints, sunglasses for 175 points — and finally \nhe descends from the sky and lands in front of \nhis school in his own Harrier Jump Jet (one \nof those jet planes that can descend straight \ndown). As he lands, the commercial displays \n“HARRIER FIGHTER 7,000,000 PEPSI POINTS.”\nAfter watching the ad, Mr. Leonard sent in an \norder form with 15 Pepsi Points plus $700,000 and change (to cover postage and handling) \nand demanded the Harrier Jump Jet. Pepsi \nclaimed no contract had been formed. One of \nPepsi’s defenses was that because the ad and \nthe catalog didn’t constitute an offer but were \ninvitations to make an offer, they could decline \nto accept Leonard’s offer. They also defended \non the grounds that even if they had made an \noffer, it wasn’t a serious offer. They argued that \nLeonard’s thinking it was serious didn’t matter.\nThe court decided in favor of Pepsico. It held \nthat Pepsi’s objective manifestations in the ad \nwould lead a reasonable person to conclude \nthat Pepsi was joking. Leonard was tossed out \nof court. To decide for yourself whether a rea -\nsonable person would think Pepsi was joking, \nwatch the Pepsi Harrier Jet Commercial video \non YouTube.",15097
20-Determining Whether Language Constitutes an Offer.pdf,20-Determining Whether Language Constitutes an Offer,"29  Chapter 2: Let’s Make a Deal: Offer and Acceptance\ntake unfair advantage. Contract law has ways of dealing with this, as I explain \nin Chapter 6. However, although the courts may scrutinize such a contract \nmore carefully and may not enforce all the terms, they usually conclude that  \na contract was formed.\nForming contracts without words:  \nThe implied-in-fact contract\nAs long as other objective manifestations are present, you don’t even need \nwords to form a contract. Parties may, through their actions, form an implied-\nin-fact contract  — a real contract (that is, a bargained-for contract) found in \nthe conduct of the parties rather than in their words. For example, suppose \nyou go into your favorite fast-food restaurant and see that the manager is \nbusy with customers. You grab a bottle of water out of the cooler, and, catch -\ning her eye, you point to the bottle and she nods. You then take a seat and \nstart drinking the water. Even though the two of you have not exchanged \nwords, little doubt exists that you entered into a contract to pay for that \nwater. This is an implied-in-fact contract.\nDetermining Whether Language \nConstitutes an Offer\nAn offer requires a promise, and a promise requires a commitment, but \nsometimes what a person says doesn’t rise to the level of commitment and is \ntherefore not an offer. The test is whether the language is so complete that \nit requires nothing more than acceptance to form a contract. If the language \nrequires something more than acceptance, then it’s probably not an offer. \nUsing this test typically disqualifies the following as offers:\n ✓ Preliminary inquiries\n ✓ Advertisements\n ✓ Circulars (offers that were sent to multiple persons) if the offerees know \nthey were sent to multiple persons\n ✓ Catalogs\nOf these four, preliminary inquiries and advertisements are the most \ncommon. The following sections explain how to distinguish inquiries and \nadvertisements from genuine offers and how circulars and catalog listings fit \nin with advertisements.\n30 Part I: Introducing Contract Law and Contract Formation \nDistinguishing a preliminary  \ninquiry from an offer\nA preliminary inquiry  is like a fishing expedition: The parties merely discuss \nwhat they’d hypothetically be willing to offer or accept. To test whether a \nparty has presented an offer, ask whether a reasonable person would think \nthat no more than an acceptance is required to form a contract. Carefully \nscrutinize the language and the context.\n Suppose Mary says to Tom, “How much would you sell your house for?” Tom \nresponds, “I’d like to get $100,000 for it.” Mary says, “I accept!” Have the two \nparties formed a contract? Mary clearly uttered a manifestation of acceptance, \nbut does what Tom said constitute an offer? The test is whether a reasonable \nperson observing this conversation would think that when Tom said, “I’d like \nto get $100,000 for it,” he was committing to sell his house for $100,000. I think \na reasonable person would conclude that this isn’t the language of an offer. \nHe was expecting Mary to make him an offer. It’s not the same as saying some -\nthing like, “Give me $100,000 for it, and it’s yours.” Tom’s statement is more \nalong the lines of a preliminary inquiry than an offer.\nSimilarly, if Tom puts a sign outside his house that says, “For Sale. $100,000,” \nthat’s not an offer. Mary can’t simply accept the offer by handing Tom a suitcase \nwith $100,000 in it, because that’s not the customary practice for this type of \ntransaction. Customary practice is to put a for-sale sign outside a house to solicit \noffers to buy the house, not to get people to give an acceptance. Based on the \nlanguage and the context, more than acceptance is required to form a contract.\nAds, catalogs, and circulars: Distinguishing \nadvertisements from offers\nAn advertisement is generally not an offer. It’s an invitation to make an offer. \nAssume a store advertised in the newspaper, “Golden 50"" HDTVs $500.” If this \nwere an offer, the store would legally be obligated to sell a TV to everyone \nwho accepted the offer, even if the store ran out of those TVs. If the store \ncouldn’t deliver on its commitment, it would be found in breach.\nContract law comes to the aid of the store by saying that the ad is merely an \ninvitation to make an offer. Technically, when a customer goes to the store \nand says, “I’d like to buy one of those TVs you advertised,” the customer is \nmaking an offer. The store can then either accept or reject it.\nSimilarly, a catalog is not an offer but an invitation to make an offer. For \nexample, if I order something from a store catalog and they’re unable to \nsupply it, the store isn’t in breach. I make my offer when I submit my order.  \nIf they can’t fill my order, they decline my offer.",4856
21-Determining Whether the Offeror Can Back Out Revoking the Offer.pdf,21-Determining Whether the Offeror Can Back Out Revoking the Offer,"31  Chapter 2: Let’s Make a Deal: Offer and Acceptance\nOf course, stores could take advantage of this arrangement by employing the \nbait and switch — advertise an incredible deal (the bait) and then offer a deal \nthat’s not so great (the switch). Contract law has no solution for this problem, \nbut most jurisdictions have enacted consumer protection laws that make the \nbait and switch a legal violation. This is why stores often add language to their \nadvertisements, such as “while supplies last” or “quantities limited.”\nAnother way to resolve the issue of multiple acceptances and limited supplies \nis to make an item available only to the first person who accepts. If I have six \nfriends over to my house, for example, and say to them, “I’ll sell this widget \nfor $10,” five of them may accept. I’d be in trouble if the remaining four filed a \nbreach of contract claim against me. A reasonable person in this situation would \nprobably say that because the six offerees knew I had only one widget for sale, a \nreasonable way to resolve which of them got it would be the first to accept.\nAn advertisement may be an offer if it’s so clear and definite that only accep -\ntance is required to form the contract. Circulars are especially vulnerable \nbecause each recipient might not reasonably know that others have received the \nsame circular. If I send a letter to six friends offering to sell a widget for $10, this \nmay constitute an offer. If each recipient didn’t know I’d sent the offer to others, \nthen I could be bound by multiple acceptances, because each offeree might rea -\nsonably think I had one widget and was offering it to him or her exclusively.\nDeciding How Long an  \nOffer Remains Open\nAn offer remains open for whatever time period is reasonable . What’s reason -\nable varies according to facts and circumstances. If late in the day on Friday \nI offer to sell you 1,000 shares of Megalomart stock for $20 a share, you may \nreasonably expect the offer to remain open until the opening bell on Monday, \nbecause the share value won’t change over the weekend. If we’re standing on \nthe floor of the New York Stock Exchange during the trading day, however, \nand I say the same thing to you, the offer may be open for only a few seconds, \nbecause values may be very volatile. (Some old cases state that an offer made \nduring a face-to-face meeting lapses when that meeting ends.)What’s a widget?\nIn Contracts classes, professors are always \ncoming up with hypotheticals that involve \nbuying and selling widgets. This may lead you \nto wonder, What’s a widget? The answer: A widget  is a hypothetical good bought and sold in \nContracts and Economics classes. Think of it as \na gadget, a whatchamacallit, or a thingamajig.\n32 Part I: Introducing Contract Law and Contract Formation \nThe offeror may override the “reasonable period” rule by setting a specific \ntime period. On Friday, for example, I can say to you, “I’ll sell you 1,000 \nshares of Megalomart stock for $20 a share, and this offer is open until \nTuesday noon.” Unless another offer-terminating rule applies, the offer \nremains open until that time. One of those rules is that the death of the \nofferor or offeree terminates the offer.\nDetermining Whether the Offeror Can \nBack Out: Revoking the Offer\nKeeping an offer open indefinitely would result in keeping the offeror on the \nhook until the offeree got around to accepting it, which is obviously unfair to \nthe offeror. Because of this, contract law allows the offeror to back out under \ncertain conditions. The following sections explain how and under what cir -\ncumstances an offeror is allowed to back out and how the offeror and offeree \nmay use an option contract to keep the offer open for an extended period.\nAfter making the offer, the offeror may revoke  (take back) the offer any \ntime before acceptance. For example, if I say, “I’ll sell you 1,000 shares of \nMegalomart stock for $20 a share,” and while you’re thinking about it, I say, \n“I take it back!” then I’ve effectively revoked the offer and it’s no longer avail -\nable for you to accept.\nEven if the offeror promises to keep the offer open for a specific time, she \nmay revoke the offer before the time expires. For example, if on Friday, I say, \n“I’ll sell you 1,000 shares of Megalomart stock for $20 a share, and this offer \nis open until Tuesday noon,” and then I say, “I take it back,” I’ve successfully \nrevoked the offer, because I merely made you a gift promise  to keep the offer \nopen until Tuesday. In U.S. law, gift promises are not enforceable.\nThe rule that the offeror may revoke the offer any time before acceptance has \nseveral exceptions, including the following:\n ✓ Option contracts\n ✓ Statutes that create an option\n ✓ Reliance on the offer\nThe following sections discuss these exceptions in greater detail.\nMaking an option contract\nFor an offer to remain open, a party must make an enforceable promise — a \npromise given in exchange for something from the other party. One way to \n33  Chapter 2: Let’s Make a Deal: Offer and Acceptance\nkeep an offer open is through the use of an option contract:  One party agrees \nto keep the option open in exchange for something, often money.\nAssume that after I make the offer on Friday, you say, “I promise you a dollar \nto keep that offer open until Tuesday noon.” You made an offer to give me a \ndollar for my agreeing to keep my offer open until Tuesday. If I accept, then \nwe have an enforceable option contract.\nRecognizing statutes that create an option\nThrough a statute, the legislature is free to change the common-law rule. The \nlaw may disallow an offeror from revoking an offer under certain conditions. \nIn situations in which the specified conditions exist, parties make an option \ncontract without meeting the common-law requirements. The legislature has \ndone this in UCC § 2-205, which is called the firm offer rule.\nAs enacted in North Carolina, the statute provides the following:\n§ 30-2-205. Firm offers.\nAn offer by a merchant to buy or sell goods in a signed writing which by \nits terms gives assurance that it will be held open is not revocable, for \nlack of consideration, during the time stated or if no time is stated for a \nreasonable time, but in no event may such period of irrevocability exceed \n3 months; but any such term of assurance on a form supplied by the \nofferee must be separately signed by the offeror.\nThis statue essentially creates an option contract without the offeree’s \nhaving to pay for it. Note, however, the limited context for this rule. Because \nit’s found in Article 2 of the UCC, it applies only to the sale of goods. And by \nits language, it applies only to merchants — parties experienced in business \npractices. And it applies only when the merchant makes the offer in writing. \nFinally, the offer must state that it will be held open. This rule reflects the \nstandard business practice — merchants expect that if they make a written \nstatement that an offer will be open, they’ve made a commitment.\nThis statute would not apply, however, if the merchant put an ad in the news -\npaper stating, “This price is good until Tuesday,” because the ad is merely an \ninvitation to make an offer. For more about ads, see the earlier section “Ads, \ncatalogs, and circulars: Distinguishing advertisements from offers.”\n The legislature may enact a statute  to change the common law  — the rules that \ngovern contracts as established by the body of cases judges have decided. \nThe statutes you encounter most frequently in contract law are in the Uniform \nCommercial Code (UCC), particularly Article 2, which deals with the sale of \ngoods. ( Tip: When you see a statute number in the form 2-###, the 2 refers  \nto Article 2.)",7844
22-Deciding Whether the Offer Has Been Accepted.pdf,22-Deciding Whether the Offer Has Been Accepted,"34 Part I: Introducing Contract Law and Contract Formation \nRelying on the offer\nAs a general rule, an offeree shouldn’t rely on an offer. For example, assume I \noffered you 10,000 pens for $1 each. Offer in hand, you go out and rent space \nto open a pen store, buy pencils, and take out advertising. As you’re headed \nback to me, I revoke the offer before you accept. I had no idea you were going \nto do all that. If you wanted to bind me, you could’ve negotiated for an option \nto keep the offer open. You didn’t, so you’re out of luck.\n The exception arose in the case of Drennan v. Star Paving.  Drennan was a \ncontractor who bid to get a job building a school. In his bid, which is an \noffer, he used Star Paving’s bid on the paving portion of the contract. After \nDrennan was awarded the job to build the school but before he could accept \nStar Paving’s bid for the paving, Star Paving tried to revoke its offer. The \ncourt created an exception to the general rule that an offeror can revoke \nat any time before acceptance. In this case, Drennan couldn’t accept Star \nPaving’s bid until he knew (1) Star Paving had made the low bid for paving \nand (2) Drennan’s bid on the school-building job was accepted. A reasonable \nperson in Star Paving’s shoes would’ve known that, so the court held that Star \nPaving’s bid was open for a reasonable time until after Drennan found out \nwhether he had won the contract.\nDeciding Whether the Offer  \nHas Been Accepted\nAssuming that an offer has been made and not yet terminated, the offeree has \nthe power to form a contract by accepting the offer. Not every action by the \nofferee constitutes an acceptance, however. This section explains the rules \nthat govern acceptance.\nAcceptance must match the  \noffer: The mirror-image rule\nThe offeror is the master of the offer, so the offeree’s acceptance must be \nthe mirror image  of the offer, matching it in every respect. If the offeror \nstates that the offer’s open until Tuesday and the offeree tries to accept it \non Wednesday, that doesn’t qualify as acceptance, because the offer lapsed \non Tuesday. If the offer is to sell shares of stock for $20 and the offeree \nresponds, “It’s a deal for $19 a share,” that’s not acceptance, because it  \nfails to match the offer’s terms.\n35  Chapter 2: Let’s Make a Deal: Offer and Acceptance\n Any attempted acceptance that fails to adhere to the mirror-image rule is a \nrejection of the offer and is considered to be a counteroffer.\nWhen the offeree in the preceding example tries to accept at $19 a share, she \nrejects the offer to sell at $20 a share, becomes the offeror, and presents a \ncounteroffer to purchase shares at $19 each. If that counteroffer is rejected, \nthe party making the counteroffer can’t bind the offeror by saying, “Then I \naccept your offer of $20 a share,” because that offer’s no longer on the table. \nIt terminated upon rejection.\n To retain the power of acceptance, the offeree can make an inquiry. Instead \nof offering $19 per share, the offeree could say something like, “While keeping \nyour offer of $20 open, may I inquire as to whether you would consider sell -\ning for $19 a share?” If the offeree does that, then the original offer probably \nremains open.\nAcceptance is effective on  \ndispatch: The mailbox rule\nOne of the more ancient rules of offer and acceptance is the mailbox rule . \nAccording to this rule, acceptance is effective on dispatch — that is, when it \nleaves the offeree’s hands, not when the offeror receives it.\n For example, suppose I present an offer to you by mail. You receive the offer on \nWednesday, and on Thursday, when the offer is still open, you mail your accep -\ntance. On Friday, you have second thoughts, and you send me a fax that says, “I \nreject your offer.” On Saturday, I get your letter that says, “I accept your offer.” \nEven though I received your rejection by fax first, your acceptance was effective \nwhen you put it in the mailbox, so at that moment we had a contract.\nThe mailbox rule is designed to prevent the offeree from gaining an unfair \nadvantage by accepting and then having additional time to speculate on \nwhether she has made a wise decision.\nLooking at various forms of acceptance\nAs the master of the offer, the offeror determines the medium  of acceptance, \nsuch as postal mail, e-mail, or fax, when presenting the offer. The offeree \nmust communicate acceptance using a medium that’s as good or better. So \nif the offeror presents the offer by postal mail, the offeree may accept via \npostal mail or a better method, such as fax or e-mail. The offeror may also \ndetermine the manner  of acceptance:\n36 Part I: Introducing Contract Law and Contract Formation \n ✓ Promise\n ✓ Performance\n ✓ Promise or performance (letting the offeree choose)\nFollowing the usual rule, the manner is whatever’s reasonable in the circum -\nstances unless the offeror specifies the manner. This section explains the \nthree manners of acceptance in greater detail.\nAccepting by promise: Bilateral contracts\nUsually, the offeror wants a promissory acceptance  — a return promise that \nseals the deal. A promissory acceptance gives the offeror the security of having \na contractual commitment that the offeree will do something. When Joe says to \nMary, “I’ll buy your bicycle for $200,” he reasonably expects her to respond by \nsaying something like, “It’s a deal.” When she does, a contract is formed, in this \ncase a bilateral (two-sided) contract.  Each party has promised something to the \nother, and each is immediately bound when the contract is formed.\n When both parties sign a contract, they form a bilateral contract. Technically, \nthe first to sign is the offeror, saying in effect, “I promise to do all the things \nI’m obligated to do in this writing if you promise to do all the things you’re \nobligated to do in this writing.” When the second person signs, that’s the \nacceptance, and they’re now both obligated to perform.\nAccepting by performance: Unilateral contracts\nSometimes the offeror wants acceptance by  performance,  meaning acceptance \nis conditional upon the offeree’s taking some action that’s specified in the \noffer. Acceptance by performance is described as a unilateral (one-sided) \ncontract,  which is somewhat of a misnomer, because it describes only the \noffer, which is always one-sided. Unilateral contract  really means an offer to \nbe accepted by performance.\n Unilateral contracts are common in reward, prize, and game situations. If \nmy dog goes missing, for example, I may put up posters that say, “Lost dog. \nReward $100.” I’m promising offerees $100 on condition that they accept by \ngiving me the performance of finding my dog. Notice I don’t have the security \nof knowing that any party has committed to finding my dog. I’m just hoping \nthat the offer will induce performance. If I want the assurance of performance, \nI could make a bilateral contract by offering to pay someone $50 if he prom -\nises to look for my dog and having him agree to it.\nThe offeror’s right to revoke the offer any time before acceptance can cause \nproblems in a unilateral contract, because acceptance occurs only upon com -\npletion of performance. The offeror could revoke after the offeree has begun \nperformance but not completed it, thus causing the offeree hardship. To help \nprevent situations like this, contract law has a rule: If the offeree begins per -\nformance and the offeror either knows this or reasonably wouldn’t require \n37  Chapter 2: Let’s Make a Deal: Offer and Acceptance\nnotice, an option contract is created and the offeror can’t revoke the offer \nduring the reasonable time that the offeree would complete performance.\n For example, suppose I offer $10,000 to the first person who runs from Boston \nto Los Angeles in 30 days or less. If you promise me you’ll do it, I would rea -\nsonably say that your promise is irrelevant because this is a contract to be \naccepted by performance, not by promise. So you begin running. On the 30th \nday, you’re totally exhausted, but you see a big sign ahead that says “Welcome \nto L.A.” As you approach, I jump out from behind it and say, “Ha-ha! I revoke \nmy offer.” You then run past the sign.\nAccording to the general rule, the offer terminated because I revoked it \nbefore acceptance by performance — before you reached L.A. With the \nexception, however, as soon as you start running, we have an option contract \nthat binds me not to revoke, though it didn’t bind you to complete perfor -\nmance. I can’t revoke after you’ve begun performance, and assuming you \ncomplete the run, thus completing performance, I owe you $10,000.\nAccepting by promise or performance: Offeree’s choice\nWhen an offer can be accepted by either promise or performance,  then as \nsoon as the offeree begins performance, both parties are bound as if they had \nmade a bilateral contract.\n For example, suppose I say to you, “I’m going on vacation for a month. It would \nbe great if you could paint my garage while I’m gone for $2,000. You can either \ntell me you’re going to do it or just do it.” You could reasonably promise to do it, \nin which case a bilateral contract would be formed at that moment, or you could \nreasonably not say anything and just do it. Because this offer can be accepted by \neither promise or performance, at the moment you begin slapping paint on my \ngarage, a contract is formed. If you then decide to stop, you’re in breach.\n If an offer can reasonably be accepted either by promise or performance, \nthen the offeree’s beginning of performance binds both parties just as if the \nofferee had promised to do it. Distinguish that situation from the offer that \ncan be accepted only by performance. In that case, the offeree’s beginning of \nperformance prevents the offeror from revoking the offer but doesn’t bind the \nofferee to complete.\nChanging the rules by statute: UCC § 2-206\nJust as the UCC changes the rule for option contracts in § 2-205 by creating an \noption contract without consideration (see the earlier section “Recognizing \nstatutes that create an option”), UCC § 2-206(1)(b) creates a change of rules \nwith respect to contracts to be accepted by performance. As enacted in North \nCarolina, it provides:\n§ 25-2-206.",10377
23-Making Sense of the Battle of the Forms and UCC  2-207.pdf,23-Making Sense of the Battle of the Forms and UCC  2-207,"38 Part I: Introducing Contract Law and Contract Formation \nAn order or other offer to buy goods for prompt or current shipment \nshall be construed as inviting acceptance either by a prompt promise to \nship or by the prompt or current shipment of conforming or nonconform -\ning goods, but such a shipment of nonconforming goods does not con -\nstitute an acceptance if the seller seasonably notifies the buyer that the \nshipment is offered only as an accommodation to the buyer.\nThis means that a merchant may accept by promise or performance, with \nperformance being the shipping of what the purchaser ordered or something \ndifferent (“nonconforming goods”). Note that this changes the common-law \nmirror-image rule — the rule that an acceptance that is different from the \noffer is not an acceptance (see the earlier section “Acceptance must match \nthe offer: The mirror-image rule”). Here, it is an acceptance. However, if the \nseller ships a different product and says something like, “I know this isn’t \nwhat you ordered, but that item was out of stock, so I’m shipping you a \nslightly higher quality replacement for your convenience,” then the seller’s \nperformance doesn’t qualify as acceptance. The seller has now made a coun -\nteroffer, which the buyer can accept or reject.\n Suppose a customer (offeror) orders ten Type A widgets. According to the \nstatute, the offeree may accept either by promising to ship the goods or by \nactually shipping the goods (performance). If the offeree promises to ship the \ngoods, the parties have formed a contract for the sale of ten Type A widgets.\nAlternatively, suppose the offeree ships Type B widgets rather than Type \nA widgets. In common law, this isn’t acceptance, because the mirror-image \nrule says that acceptance must exactly match the offer. Technically, it’s a \ncounteroffer, which the buyer doesn’t have to accept. But the drafters of the \nCode wanted to make life a little harder for the seller who ships the wrong \ngoods, so instead of treating the shipment of wrong goods as a counteroffer, \nthe Code says that the “shipment of conforming or nonconforming  goods” \nqualifies as acceptance. As soon as the seller ships those Type B widgets, the \ncontract is formed for Type A widgets, and the seller is in breach.\nThe Code cleverly provides a way out for the innocent seller. If the seller has \nno Type A widgets but thinks the buyer would rather have Type B widgets \nthan no widgets at all, the seller may ship the nonconforming items as long \nas he notifies the buyer that they’re being sent as an accommodation. If the \nseller does this, the shipment of nonconforming goods is not a breach but a \ncounteroffer that the buyer may accept or refuse.\nMaking Sense of the “Battle of  \nthe Forms” and UCC § 2-207\nDrafters of the UCC knew that parties often don’t read their contracts. Even \nworse, when a business receives a form contract from another party, they may \n39  Chapter 2: Let’s Make a Deal: Offer and Acceptance\nnot read or sign it. Instead, they send their own form contract in response, \nwhich the other party doesn’t read or sign. When a dispute breaks out, one \nparty points to a term in its form as the governing term for the contract, and \nthe other party makes the same claim. The Battle of the Forms is on!\nCommon law had a simple solution to this problem: the offeree’s form rules. \nIf the offeree’s form differed in any way, according to the mirror-image rule, it \ndidn’t qualify as acceptance but as a counteroffer. If the parties then shipped \ngoods and paid for them, it looked like they’d assented to the terms of that \ncounteroffer. But the UCC’s drafters didn’t think it was fair that the offeree \nshould always get its terms in a situation where no one bothered to read the \nforms, so the UCC set out to restore some balance.\nThe drafters of the UCC brought their tinkering with the common-law rules to \nnew heights with § 2-207, making it undoubtedly the most difficult Contracts \ntopic to wrap your brain around. This section provides the following, as \nenacted in North Carolina:\n  § 25-2-207. Additional terms in acceptance of confirmation.\n  (1) A definite and seasonable expression of acceptance or a written con -\nfirmation which is sent within a reasonable time operates as an accep -\ntance even though it states terms additional to or different from those \noffered or agreed upon, unless acceptance is expressly made conditional \non assent to the additional or different terms.\n  (2) The additional terms are to be construed as proposals for addition \nto the contract. Between merchants such terms become part of the  \ncontract unless:\n  (a) the offer expressly limits acceptance to the terms of the offer;\n  (b) they materially alter it; or\n  (c) notification of objection to them has already been given or is \ngiven within a reasonable time after notice of them is received.\n  (3) Conduct by both parties which recognizes the existence of a con -\ntract is sufficient to establish a contract for sale although the writings of \nthe parties do not otherwise establish a contract. In such case the terms \nof the particular contract consist of those terms on which the writings of \nthe parties agree, together with any supplementary terms incorporated \nunder any other provisions of this code.\nIf you don’t get it, don’t feel inferior. UCC § 2-207 leaves even the most serious \nContracts scholars puzzled. Part of the problem is that the section is very poorly \ndrafted. When it addresses a fork in the road, it often explains what happens if \nyou travel down one fork but not what happens if you go down the other.\nIn this section, I reveal the UCC’s solution and explain some of the problems \nthat occur when\n40 Part I: Introducing Contract Law and Contract Formation \n ✓ A party refuses to contract unless the other party agrees to its terms\n ✓ The offeree includes an additional term in its form\n ✓ The offeree includes a different term in its form\nDeciding whether acceptance  \nis conditional\nSection 2-207(1) starts out by referring to “a definite and seasonable expres -\nsion of acceptance,” without explaining what that means. Most authorities \nthink this means that for the exchanged forms to make a contract, the par -\nties have to at least agree to the same essential terms, such as the quantity, \ndescription of the goods, and price. In fact, the parties usually read those \nterms and make sure that they agree with them. The terms they don’t read \nare the “boilerplate” terms that follow. So when 2-207 refers to “additional or \ndifferent terms,” it probably means the boilerplate terms.\nSubsection (1) of UCC § 2-207 essentially tosses out the mirror-image rule.  \nSo when a party’s response to an offer contains additional or different terms, \nit’s considered acceptance, as opposed to a counteroffer, and a contract is \nborn, unless . . .\nThe “unless” near the end of subsection (1) gives the offeree a way to make its \nacceptance conditional upon the offeror’s acceptance of the additional or differ -\nent terms. In other words, if the offeree’s form says there’s no deal if the offeror \ndoesn’t agree to these new terms, that form is not an acceptance. Offer and non -\nacceptance  is not a contract. Some disputes revolve around the language neces -\nsary to satisfy this requirement, but it’s best to be very clear, expressly stating in \neffect, “If you don’t agree to my terms, we don’t have a deal.”\nIf the language is clearly stated, then at this point, the offeror is free to walk \naway without being in breach. But because the offeror doesn’t read the form, \nthat rarely happens. Instead, the offeror files the form and proceeds with the \ntransaction, leaving one to wonder what the terms are when the parties pro -\nceed without mutual assent.\nThe answer is in subsection (3), which essentially says that if the offeror \nmakes acceptance conditional and the parties act as though they have a  \ncontract by accepting goods and paying for them, this is “conduct by both \nparties which recognizes the existence of a contract,” so they’ve made a  \ncontract by their actions.\nIn such a case, follow the second sentence of subsection (3) to determine the \nterms of the contract:\n41  Chapter 2: Let’s Make a Deal: Offer and Acceptance\n ✓ Where the parties’ forms agree on a term, that term is a part of their \nagreement.  For example, if both the buyer’s and seller’s forms state \n“The seller is excused from performance only if events A, B, and C \noccur,” the terms match and are part of the contract.\n ✓ Where they don’t agree, the contradictory provisions aren’t automati -\ncally part of the agreement.  For example, if the buyer’s form states, \n“The seller is excused from performance only if events A, B, and C \noccur,” and the seller’s form states, “The seller is excused if events D, \nE, and F occur,” the terms don’t agree, so they’re not part of the agree -\nment. The term that becomes part of the agreement is supplied through \nthe default rules provided by the Code or the common law.\n ✓ Supplementary terms incorporated under any other provisions of the \nCode will then be included.  So, for example, if the terms relating to the \nseller’s performance don’t agree, then look for something in the Code to \ndetermine which events would excuse the seller’s performance; this would \nbe the rule from § 2-615 on Excuse by Failure of Presupposed Conditions. \nIf the Code doesn’t supply a rule, then as directed in § 1-103(b), use the \ncommon-law rule.\nDealing with additional or different terms\nAssuming the offeror hasn’t made acceptance conditional and that the offeree \nhas accepted by responding with his own form, subsection (1) of UCC § 2-207 \nsays that the parties have a contract. Now the question turns to which terms \ngovern the contract, and that depends on whether the offeree’s terms are addi -\ntional or different, an important distinction drawn in subsection (1):\n ✓ Additional terms:  By additional, the section probably means a term in \nthe offeree’s form that addresses a topic not addressed in the offeror’s \nform. For example, if the offeror’s form is silent on the method of dis -\npute resolution, then the offeree’s term stating that “all disputes go to \narbitration” is an additional term.\n ✓ Different terms:  By different,  it probably means a term in the offeree’s \nform that addresses the same topic addressed in the offeror’s form in a \ndifferent way. For example, if the offeror’s form states, “All disputes go \nto arbitration in New York,” and the offeree’s form states, “All disputes \ngo to arbitration in New Jersey,” the terms are different.\nWith a clear understanding of the difference between additional and different \nterms, you’re ready to determine which term is enforceable.\n42 Part I: Introducing Contract Law and Contract Formation \nChoosing the term when additional terms exist\nAccording to subsection (2), additional terms “are to be construed as propos -\nals for addition to the contract.” However, “between merchants such terms \nbecome part of the contract.” If both parties are merchants, then presumably the \nofferee’s proposed term becomes the contract term. For example, if the offeror’s \nterms were silent on dispute resolution and the offeree’s form proposed arbitra -\ntion, then the offeree’s additional term presumably governs. But this is only a \npresumption. The offeror has three chances to reject the proposal:\n ✓ Under subsection (2)(a), a rejection of the proposal exists if “the offer \nexpressly limits acceptance to the terms of the offer.” So the offeror has a \nchance to reject proposed terms by drafting that language in its contract.\n ✓ If the offeror didn’t expressly limit acceptance to the terms of the offer, \nthen under subsection (2)(c), a rejection of the proposed terms exists \nif “notification of objection to them has already been given or is given \nwithin a reasonable time after notice of them is received.” In other \nwords, the offeror has a chance to notify the offeree that it rejects the \nproposed term.\n ✓ If the offeror doesn’t take advantage of that option, it gets a third bite at \nthe apple. Under subsection (2)(b), the proposed terms are rejected if \n“they materially alter  it,” “it” being the contract.\nThe Code doesn’t explain what “materially alter” means, but the drafters of \nthe Code provide some Official Comments as guidance:\n ✓ Official Comment 4 to this section of the UCC indicates that “materially \nalter” means that the terms “result in surprise or hardship if incorpo -\nrated without express awareness by the other party.” In the case of the \narbitration clause example, most courts would reject the offeree’s addi -\ntional term stating that “all disputes go to arbitration,” because it would \nresult in surprise or hardship to the offeror.\n ✓ Comment 5 contains a list of clauses that would not involve “unreason -\nable surprise” — for example, “a clause fixing a reasonable time for com -\nplaints within customary limits.”\nChoosing the term when different terms exist\nUnfortunately, subsection (2) provides no guidance on what to do with differ -\nent terms in the offeree’s form, so it’s up to the courts to come up with a rule \nto plug the gap. Courts in different jurisdictions have formulated three differ -\nent rules to deal with this issue:\n43  Chapter 2: Let’s Make a Deal: Offer and Acceptance\n ✓ The knockout rule:  The knockout rule is the most popular approach \n(although it doesn’t make a lot of sense to me). The court knocks out \nboth terms that differ and reads in the default rule from the Code or \ncommon law. If the offeror’s term states, “All disputes go to arbitration \nin New York,” and the offeree’s form states, “All disputes go to arbitra -\ntion in New Jersey,” the court knocks out both terms and reads in the \ncommon-law rule that supplements the Code, stating that the parties \ntake their dispute to court.\n ✓ Offeror’s term prevails:  Some courts say that when different terms exist, \nthe offeror’s term prevails. If the offeror’s form states, “All disputes go to \narbitration in New York,” and the offeree’s form states, “All disputes go to \narbitration in New Jersey,” then the offeror’s term prevails, and the con -\ntract term is “All disputes go to arbitration in New York.”\n  Additional terms are handled very similarly according to subsection (2)\n(a): If the offeree proposes an additional term that the offeror objects to, \nthat term is rejected. In this case, when the offeree proposes a different \nterm, some courts take the view that the offeror has already objected to \nthat term by having a different term in its form.\n ✓ Same as additional term:  Some courts treat different terms the same \nway they treat additional terms (see the earlier section “Choosing the \nterm when additional terms exist” for details). Because of the “materi -\nally alter” rule of (2)(b), only an offeree’s term that doesn’t differ sub -\nstantially from the offeror’s term becomes part of the contract. If the \nofferor’s form states, “All disputes go to arbitration in New York” and \nthe offeree’s form states, “All disputes go to arbitration in New Jersey,” \na court would most likely not find the difference between the two terms \nmaterial because it’s no hardship for a New Yorker to cross over into \nNew Jersey — the contract term would likely become “all disputes go \nto arbitration in New Jersey.” However, if the offeror’s form states, “All \ndisputes go to arbitration in New York” and the offeree’s form states, \n“All disputes go to arbitration in Hawaii,” the offeree’s different term \nmost likely is material and the contract term would likely become “all \ndisputes go to arbitration in New York.”\n44 Part I: Introducing Contract Law and Contract Formation",15927
24-Checking an Agreement for Consideration.pdf,24-Checking an Agreement for Consideration,"Chapter 3\nSealing the Deal: The Doctrine  \nof Consideration\nIn This Chapter\n▶ Detecting the presence or absence of consideration\n▶ Distinguishing a bargained-for exchange from a gift promise\n▶ Spotting promises that aren’t (or look like they aren’t) supported by consideration\n▶ Knowing when contracts are enforceable even without consideration\nF \nor centuries, societies have struggled to determine which promises to \nenforce. At one extreme, society could decide that promises are enforce -\nable only if they’re made with a great deal of formality, such as a promise \naccompanied by a ritual in which the parties cut their palms and shake \nhands, sealing their agreement in blood. A mere couple of centuries ago, \npeople evidenced their promises in hot wax imprinted with their seals.\nAt the other extreme, society could declare all promises enforceable, but \nsuch a policy could result in mass confusion and chaos. An utterance of \nsocial politeness such as “My house is your house” or a bit of pillow talk like \n“I’ll always take care of you” could prove disastrous, and the courts would \nsoon tire of the lines of people seeking enforcement.\nAfter centuries of groping for a solution, the Anglo-American legal system \ndecided to enforce promises that comprise bargained-for exchanges. The some -\nthing that’s bargained for is consideration  — what each party stands to gain.\nDetermining whether consideration is present seems straightforward  \nenough — either the parties promise each other something, or they don’t — \nbut it’s not always so obvious. This idea can work in your client’s favor or \nagainst it, so you must be able to determine when consideration is or isn’t \npresent in an exchange. This chapter helps you make that determination and \nalso discusses situations in which consideration isn’t technically required.\n46 Part I: Introducing Contract Law and Contract Formation \nChecking an Agreement for Consideration\nYou may need to look very closely to find consideration in an agreement. To \ndetermine whether consideration is present, try identifying the bargained-for \nexchange. In bargained-for exchange,  one of the following situations occurs:\n ✓ Each party makes a promise to the other in order to get the other party \nto promise something in return.\n ✓ One party makes a promise to induce another party to perform, and the \ninduced party performs to get that promise.\n ✓ Each party does something in order to get the other party to do some -\nthing in return.\n In a bargained-for exchange, to bargain  doesn’t mean to negotiate. It means \nthat each party has the motive of getting something from the other in the \nexchange. Assume that I say to you, “I’m going to give you a bicycle for your \nbirthday,” and in response, you say to me, “That’s great! And I’ll give you some \nDVDs for yours.” In this exchange, we each made a promise, but no bargain \nexists. I didn’t make my promise to you with the motive  of getting anything \nfrom you. This is an exchange of gift promises,  meaning promises without  \nconsideration, so they aren’t legally enforceable.\nUsing a simple Q&A\n Because consideration requires a bargained-for exchange in which the motive \nfor each party’s promise or performance is to get a promise or performance \nfrom the other party, you can determine whether consideration is present \nthrough a brief Q&A. For example, assume that I offered to sell you my car  \nfor $10,000, and you agreed to purchase it. The Q&A might look like this:\nQ: Why did I promise you the car?\nA: To get the promise of $10,000.\nQ: Why did you promise the $10,000?\nA: To get the car.\nBecause the promises were made in order to induce the other to give a prom -\nise or performance, consideration is present. Famous American jurist Oliver \nWendell Holmes would refer to a bargained-for exchange as reciprocal induce -\nment,  which establishes consideration. With my promise of the car, I’m induc -\ning you to give me $10,000, and your promise of $10,000 induces me to give \nyou the car.\n47  Chapter 3: Sealing the Deal: The Doctrine of Consideration\nMaking a diagram\nConsider diagramming the contract so you can see what each party bargained to \nreceive from the other. In the agreement where I promise to sell my car and you \npromise to purchase it for $10,000, the bargained-for exchange diagram looks \nlike Figure 3-1. If one of those arrows had nothing attached to it, then consider -\nation would be absent. For example, if I promised to give you my car as a gift, \nconsideration is absent because I didn’t bargain to get anything in return.\n Figure 3-1:   \nA  \nbargained-\nfor \nexchange \ndiagram.\n Me YouCar\n$10,000\n In discussing an exchange, sometimes your instructor or a case may state that \nthe promisor  did such-and-such. This can be confusing, because contracts \nusually have two promisors, each promising something different. The trick is \nto figure out which promisor the speaker or author is referring to. In our hypo -\nthetical involving the sale of the car, if the instructor asks whether the promi -\nsor gave any consideration for the car,  the instructor must be referring to you, \nbecause you’re the promisor who bargained to get the car.\n Although parties generally have freedom of contract, they don’t have free -\ndom to waive consideration. I may say to you, “I really, really want you to \nhave my car, and I promise you can have it even without any consideration.” \nBut according to contract law, my promise would be unenforceable, because \nthere’s no consideration for it. However, I could accomplish my goal through \nmeans other than a contract, such as by making a gift. A gift is a property \ntransaction, and after I transfer the property to you, it’s yours.\nMaking and enforcing promises outside the courts\nIndividuals who make their own rules for enforce -\nable promises are free to seek enforcement in \na private dispute resolution system rather in a \npublic court. In the wholesale diamond business, \nwhich is largely conducted by Orthodox Jews, \nparties traditionally close a contract by uttering \nthe words “mazel and broche,” meaning “luck and blessing.” Can you imagine someone going to \ncourt and claiming, “This contract isn’t enforce -\nable because he didn’t say ‘mazel and broche’”? \nNot surprisingly, in this business, industry panels, \nrather than public courts, resolve disputes. See \nChapter 18 for information on alternative dispute \nresolution (ADR).",6516
25-Making Distinctions about Consideration.pdf,25-Making Distinctions about Consideration,"48 Part I: Introducing Contract Law and Contract Formation \nMaking Distinctions about Consideration\nIn some cases, a gift promise, which is insufficient for forming a contract, \nmay look a lot like a bargained-for exchange. In addition, courts become con -\ncerned when what one party promised doesn’t appear adequate  to make the \nagreement enforceable.\nAs you evaluate cases, subtle distinctions may arise between what consti -\ntutes consideration and what doesn’t. This section provides guidance to help \nyou identify and analyze these distinctions.\nDeciding whether it’s a bargain  \nor a gift promise\nWhen examining a contract for consideration, consider whether the agree -\nment functions as a bargain (enforceable) or merely a gift promise (unen -\nforceable). Contract law provides two ways to make this determination:\n ✓ The Restatement of Contracts (see Chapter 1) asks whether a bargain \nexists — whether each party promised something in exchange for the \npromise of the other.\n ✓ Older cases ask whether the promisor sought either a benefit  to the \npromisor or a detriment  to the promisee. In other words, the promisor’s \nreceiving something or the promisee’s giving up something is consider -\nation. For example, as consideration for my promise to pay you $100, I \nmay ask either that you give me your coat (a benefit to the promisor) or \nthat you stop drinking soda (a detriment to the promisee). This method \nis useful in close cases in which what’s being bargained isn’t so obvious.\n Samuel Williston, the early 20th-century expert in contract law, posed this \nchallenging hypothetical situation:\nA wealthy man tells a tramp that if the tramp goes around the corner to \nthe clothing store, he’ll buy him a new overcoat. [Figure 3-2 illustrates the \nexchange.] The tramp does so, and the wealthy man refuses to perform. \nDid the wealthy man bargain to get this performance (going around the \ncorner) from the tramp, or did he merely tell the tramp that the clothing \nstore was the place where he’d make a gift of a coat? If the former, then \nthe wealthy man became bound when the tramp gave the performance; if \nthe latter, then he was free to choose not to make the gift.\nTo answer this question, ask whether the promisor (the wealthy man) sought \nany benefit for himself or sought any detriment from the promisee (the \ntramp). If either condition is true, the wealthy man more likely bargained to \nget the performance, in which case consideration exists and the two parties \n49  Chapter 3: Sealing the Deal: The Doctrine of Consideration\nhave an enforceable contract; in short, the wealthy man would owe the tramp \ndamages for not giving him a new overcoat.\n Figure 3-2:  \nExchange \nbetween \nthe wealthy \nman and the \ntramp.\n Wealthy\nManTrampNew overcoat\nWalk around\nthe corner\nWilliston maintained that a reasonable person would conclude that no bar -\ngain existed in this situation. The wealthy man doesn’t benefit materially \nfrom having the tramp come to the store, and it’s not a material detriment \nto the tramp to do so. Even if there is no bargained-for contract, a court may \nstill provide relief to a party who acted on a promise by compensating that \nparty on a theory of reliance  — when a party acts or refrains from acting in \nresponse to a promise (see Chapter 4).\n In the old case of Hamer v. Sidway,  an uncle promised his nephew a large sum \nof money if the nephew didn’t engage in a number of vices, including drink -\ning and smoking, until he was 25. The nephew claimed he performed and \nsought payment, but the executor of the uncle’s estate refused to pay, claim -\ning no consideration existed because the agreement was of no benefit to the \npromisor, the uncle. In the old view, the promise is enforceable because the \npromisor (the uncle) did seek a detriment from the promisee (the nephew), \nwho gave up something. The promise is also enforceable in the modern view, \nwhich downplays the importance of benefit and detriment, because the uncle \ngot exactly the performance he bargained for under this unilateral contract: a \ncontract where the offeror seeks acceptance by performance (see Chapter 2). \nThe court properly held that the promise was enforceable.\nYour instructor may spin some interesting hypothetical situations around the \nfacts of this case. Here are a couple of hypotheticals to warm you up for the task:\n ✓ Suppose the uncle promised to give the nephew the money if he didn’t \nsmoke, and the nephew performed. Then the uncle claims absence of con -\nsideration because the nephew didn’t smoke anyway. The uncle claims that \nhe received no benefit and that the nephew suffered no detriment because \nhe gave up nothing in return for the promise of the money.\n  In this case, the court would probably find that the nephew did do some -\nthing: He refrained from taking up smoking, an activity he was perfectly \nfree to engage in.\n50 Part I: Introducing Contract Law and Contract Formation \n ✓ Suppose the uncle promised to give the nephew money if he refrained \nfrom doing hard drugs. Because the nephew has a legal obligation not to \ndo drugs, the uncle could argue that the nephew did nothing he wasn’t \nalready obligated to do.\n  Some courts would agree with that analysis, but others may say that this \npromise is enforceable because the duty not to do drugs is owed to soci -\nety, and not to the uncle; therefore, there’s consideration for avoiding \ndrugs at the uncle’s request. Others may say that the promise is enforce -\nable because enforcing it is beneficial to provide another incentive to \nkeep people from doing drugs. This is the kind of question that makes \nthe Contracts class so interesting!\n Don’t look for a separate consideration for each promise in a contract. \nAlthough consideration must exist for each promise in a contract, a consider -\nation can cover more than one promise. For example, suppose I promise you \n$1,000 if you promise to (1) perform certain research for me, (2) wash my car, \nand (3) walk across the Brooklyn Bridge. The fact that I promised you only \none thing in exchange for three things from you doesn’t matter as far as con -\nsideration is concerned, because I bargained for three things from you, and \nyou bargained for only one thing from me.\nDistinguishing between sufficient  \nand adequate consideration\nAlthough an enforceable contract requires a bargained-for exchange, con -\ntract law doesn’t require that the exchange be equal. Courts generally \ndon’t place each party’s consideration on the scales of justice to determine \nwhether a contract exists. When disputes arise, courts may make a distinc -\ntion between sufficient and adequate consideration:\n ✓ Sufficient:  Consideration is sufficient if it satisfies the legal requirement \nthat a bargained-for exchange exists.\n ✓ Adequate:  Adequacy refers to the equivalency of the exchange — \nwhether each party stood to receive something reasonably equivalent  \nto what they promised.\nAlthough consideration must be sufficient for a contract, the law generally \ndoesn’t inquire into the adequacy of consideration. I’m completely free to \nmake a harebrained deal like selling my $10,000 car to you for $10, even though \nno reasonable person would consider $10 adequate. The fact that we each bar -\ngained for something is sufficient. People make bad bargains all the time.\n Although a party can’t claim lack of consideration to help her escape a con -\ntract when the exchange is lopsided, the court may scrutinize the deal more \nclosely for other factors that may explain why a person agreed to such a bad",7680
26-Detecting an Absence of Consideration.pdf,26-Detecting an Absence of Consideration,"51  Chapter 3: Sealing the Deal: The Doctrine of Consideration\ndeal. I discuss these defenses to contract formation, including fraud, duress, \nmistake, and lack of capacity, in Part II.\nDetecting an Absence of Consideration\nNot only do you need to be able to recognize consideration when you see it, \nbut you also need to be able to detect a lack of consideration when you don’t \nsee it, which is often the greater challenge. To make your job even more  \ndifficult, some agreements contain promises that feign consideration — a \nparty appears to offer something but really doesn’t. This section describes \nthree such situations — nominal consideration, pre-existing duty, and past \nconsideration — so you’re better equipped to spot a lack of consideration.\nSpotting a phony: Nominal consideration\nBy definition, a nominal consideration  is a consideration in name only — a \nphony consideration. For example, suppose I say to you, “I promise to give \nyou my car.” Knowing something about contract law you respond, “Wait \na minute. That’s a gift promise. To make it enforceable, I have to give you \nsomething for it.” I agree, and I give you a dollar to hand back to me, which \nyou do. I then give you the car.\nIf you come in at the end of the story, with a dollar being exchanged for a car, \nthis would look like an enforceable contract, complete with consideration \nfrom both sides. But when you look at the whole transaction, you clearly \nsee that no bargaining took place. You gave me a dollar to make it appear  as \nthough we had bargained. This constitutes nominal consideration, which is \nno consideration at all.\nTo qualify as consideration, we would need to make a genuine deal — one in \nwhich each of us bargained to get what we wanted. Even though courts don’t \nrequire an exchange of equivalent values, they do require a bargain, and a \ndeal as lopsided as a car for $1 doesn’t look like a bargain.\n In Fischer v. Union Trust Co. , a 1904 case (these nominal consideration cases \ntend to be rather old), a father gave his incompetent daughter a deed and \npromised to pay the mortgages on the property. As he gave her the deed on \nDecember 21, he said, “Here is a nice Christmas present.” One of her brothers \ngave her a dollar, which she gave to her father, who took it. The father later \ndied, and when his estate didn’t pay the mortgages, she sued for breach of \ncontract. The court reasoned:\nTo say that the one dollar was the real, or such valuable consideration as \nwould of itself sustain a deed of land worth several thousand dollars, is \nnot in accord with reason or common sense. The passing of the dollar by \n52 Part I: Introducing Contract Law and Contract Formation \nthe brother to his sister, and by her to her father, was treated rather as \na joke than as any actual consideration. The real and only consideration \nfor the deed and the agreement, therein contained, to pay the mortgages, \nwas the grantor’s love and affection for his unfortunate daughter, and his \nparental desire to provide for her support after he was dead.\nCould “love and affection” have been consideration if it had been bargained \nfor? Under the Restatement view, which emphasizes bargain rather than eco -\nnomic value, it appears possible, but I suspect most judges are more flinty-\neyed and will not enforce an exchange unless the thing bargained for has \nsome economic value.\n Don’t confuse  nominal with inadequate or small. The law doesn’t inquire into \nthe adequacy or amount of consideration. Any amount is sufficient, including, \nin old English history, something as insignificant as a peppercorn. But it has to \nbe bargained-for — not trumped up.\nApplying the pre-existing duty rule\nAccording to the pre-existing duty rule,  consideration is absent if a party merely \npromises to do what it’s already bound to do. For example, as I explain earlier \nin “Deciding whether it’s a bargain or a gift promise,” a promisor can claim that \navoiding drugs isn’t consideration, because doing drugs is illegal anyway.\n The pre-existing duty rule can be a problem when parties try to modify their \nexisting contract. If I promise to sell you my car and you promise to buy it for \n$10,000 in 30 days, I’m bound to sell you the car, and you’re bound to pay me \n$10,000 for it. We each obtained something of value — the binding promise of \nthe other to perform — and we each provided something of value.\nNow, suppose in 30 days, you show up with the $10,000 and I refuse to  \ngive you the car. I tell you I won’t give it to you unless you give me another \n$500. You plead with me, but I won’t budge. Desperate to get the car and \nmove on, you hand me the $500, and I give you the car.\nAccording to the pre-existing duty rule, I had no right to charge you another \n$500, because I was bound by the pre-existing contract to sell you the car for \n$10,000. I offered nothing for the extra $500. Because you received no con -\nsideration in return for that payment of $500, no contract existed, and you \nshould get your money back.\nFor more information on the pre-existing duty rule, flip to Chapter 12, where I \ndiscuss it in greater detail in relation to contract modification.\n53  Chapter 3: Sealing the Deal: The Doctrine of Consideration\nFinding past consideration\nPast consideration  is a benefit that one party already received at the time he \nmade his promise. As such, past consideration doesn’t qualify as consider -\nation if a person makes a promise in return for it. In fact, the term is a misno -\nmer because past consideration is no consideration!\n For example, if Joe says to Mary, “I’m so grateful for all you’ve done for me \nthat I promise to give you $10,000,” this promise is not enforceable. Assuming \nthat Joe’s speaking the truth, Joe already received some benefit from Mary \nbefore  making his promise to give her $10,000. He doesn’t bargain to get it.\n The application of this concept has sometimes led to abuse. For example, after \nan employee begins working for an employer, the employer promises, “When \nyou retire, I’ll give you a pension.” Many years later, the employee retires and \nthe employer claims that the promise of the pension is not enforceable for the \nfollowing reasons:\n ✓ The employer and employee never bargained for a pension.\n ✓ The fact that the employee performed services in the past was  \nnot consideration.\n ✓ Because the employee had a pre-existing duty to perform services in \nexchange for wages, the employer was getting no additional benefit  \nfor its promise.\nTechnically, the employer is right. (However, Chapter 4 explains that even \nthough this isn’t a bargained-for contract, the employee might recover on a \ntheory of reliance.)\n Similarly, a moral obligation rarely creates a legal obligation. In the old case \nof Mills v. Wyman,  Mills found Wyman’s ailing adult son and took care of him \nuntil the son died. Mills then submitted a bill for the expenses to Wyman, \nwho promised to pay the bill. Wyman then changed his mind and refused to \npay the bill. When Mills sued to enforce Wyman’s promise, the court held \nthat because the son was an adult, Wyman had no legal obligation to pay for \nhis care. He may have a moral obligation to honor his promise, but such an \nobligation is enforceable in the forum of the conscience and not in the court \nsystem. Wyman didn’t bargain for Mills’s services because they’d been ren -\ndered already at the time he made his promise to pay for them. (Chapter 4 \nexplains that even though this is not a bargained-for contract, Mills might \nrecover from Wyman’s son’s estate on a theory of restitution.)",7692
27-Tracking Down Illusory Promises.pdf,27-Tracking Down Illusory Promises,"54 Part I: Introducing Contract Law and Contract Formation \nThe rule of past consideration has one exception: If a legal obligation becomes \nunenforceable because the  statute of limitations  (the time within which a claim \nmust be brought) expires, then a promise to pay the obligation becomes \nenforceable even though the promise to pay is for a benefit previously received \nand no legal obligation to pay exists under the original agreement.\n For example, five years ago, Joe sold widgets to Mary for $5,000, but Mary \nnever got around to paying for them. Tired of waiting, Joe sues Mary, and \nMary raises the defense of the statute of limitations, claiming that the time \nto bring the suit has expired. In a fit of contrition, Mary writes Joe, “I feel bad \nabout this, and I promise I’ll pay you $3,000.” She then fails to honor that \npromise, and Joe sues on it. The new promise is enforceable but only to the \nextent of the new promise, not to the extent of the original obligation. In other \nwords, Joe can recover only $3,000, not $5,000.\nContract law used to have a similar rule that allowed debtors whose debts \nwere discharged in bankruptcy to revive those debts by promising creditors \nthey would pay them, but the Bankruptcy Code has ended that practice.\nTracking Down Illusory Promises\nSometimes you have to recognize a lack of consideration when you think you \nsee consideration. Other times you have to do the opposite — recognize the \npresence of consideration when you think you don’t see it.\nGenerally speaking, contracts are binding only if they bind both parties. If one \nparty isn’t bound to do anything, then consideration is absent — no consider -\nation, no contract. If one party isn’t bound by the agreement, then a party can \nraise a defense to enforcement of the contract by using the doctrine of illusory \npromise,  also known as lack of commitment  or lack of mutuality:\n ✓ Illusory promise,  because in reality one party didn’t promise the other \nanything that’s legally meaningful\n ✓ Lack of commitment,  because if a party isn’t committed to doing any -\nthing, then he hasn’t made a promise\n ✓ Lack of mutuality,  because if one party isn’t bound by the bargain, then \nneither is the other\n The clearest example of an illusory promise would be if I e-mailed you, “For \n$10,000, I’ll either sell you my car or I won’t,” and you e-mailed back, “It’s a \ndeal!” You now claim that we don’t have a contract, so you don’t have to buy \nthe car. I claim that you made a promise to buy it for $10,000. You did, but I \ndidn’t make a promise to sell it. Because I’m not bound to do anything, you’re \nnot bound, either.\n55  Chapter 3: Sealing the Deal: The Doctrine of Consideration\n If a person is bound to do anything,  then consideration exists. If I had written, \n“I’ll sell my car to you for either $10,000 or $10,” then I would be bound by \nyour acceptance, because even though I have a choice, either alternative \nwould be consideration. Both the sale of the car for $10,000 and the sale  \nof the car for $10 are contracts with a bargained-for exchange.\nThe issue of illusory promises often arises in satisfaction clauses, output and \nrequirements contracts, and settlement of claims, as I explain next.\nDealing with satisfaction clauses\nThe illusory contract issue often arises when the contract has a satisfaction \nclause  — wording that makes a party’s promise conditional upon that party’s \nsatisfaction with something. Suppose I agree to buy your house, subject to Recognizing an “imperfectly expressed” contract: \nHow Judge Cardozo outsmarted Lady Duff-Gordon\nOne of the most famous examples of an alleged \nillusory promise arose in Wood v. Lucy, Lady \nDuff-Gordon . Lady Duff-Gordon (whom you may \nhave seen in the movie Titanic  having dinner \nwith Jack and Rose) was a fashion designer \nwho made a deal with Wood to get endorse -\nment deals for her. The contract stated that \nhe would have the exclusive use of her name \n(certainly sufficient consideration) and that \nin return, he would pay her 50 percent of the \nincome from endorsements he secured.\nLater, Lucy received a better offer from someone \nelse and hired a lawyer to go over the Wood con -\ntract with a magnifying glass to find an escape \nhatch for her. Aha! The lawyer found some-  \nthing — although Wood promised to pay her 50 \npercent of the income from endorsements he got, \nhe didn’t actually promise to get endorsements. \nTherefore, the lawyer argued, Wood was free \nunder the contract to do nothing, and if he wasn’t bound to do anything, then Lucy wasn’t bound, \neither.\nThe Appellate Division, the intermediate appel -\nlate court in New York, actually bought this \nargument by a vote of 5-0. But fortunately the \ncase went up to the highest court, the Court \nof Appeals, and fell into the hands of the great \nBenjamin Cardozo. Judge Cardozo stated that \n“the law has outgrown its primitive stage of \nformalism where the precise word was the \nsovereign talisman, and every slip was fatal.” \nThe parties were serious businesspeople who \nintended a serious business arrangement. The \nparties had formed a contract here — it was just \n“imperfectly expressed.” So Cardozo expressed \nit more clearly — he found that the agreement \nimplied that Wood had promised to use “rea -\nsonable efforts” to get endorsements. With that \nobligation imposed on Wood, there was consid -\neration, so the contract was not illusory.\n56 Part I: Introducing Contract Law and Contract Formation \nmy satisfaction with (1) a structural report and (2) the interior painting. You \nthen get a better offer on the house and claim that we don’t have an enforce -\nable contract, because nothing in the contract binds me. All I have to do is \nsay, “I’m not satisfied,” and the deal’s off. And if nothing in the contract binds \nme, then you’re not bound, either. But courts haven’t gone for this argument.\n Even though a satisfaction clause appears to be void of commitment, the \ncourts read a commitment into it. The courts start the analysis by dividing sat -\nisfaction clauses into two types, objective and subjective:\n ✓ Objective:  Objective satisfaction is measured in terms of mechani -\ncal utility or operative fitness, as would be reflected in a structural \nreport. This type of satisfaction takes my discretion out of the equation. \nBecause I must act as a reasonable person, I have a commitment to buy \nthe home if the report shows that it’s structurally sound.\n ✓ Subjective:  Subjective satisfaction is measured in terms of personal \ntaste, fancy, or judgment. You may think that a person would have \nunlimited discretion here, but the courts say that the person exercis -\ning satisfaction is bound to act in good faith, which means he must \nact honestly. For example, whether a paint job is up to my standards \nis a measure of subjective satisfaction. If my real reason for saying I’m \nnot satisfied is that I found another house I want to buy instead, then I \nhaven’t acted honestly. I don’t have complete discretion, and because I \nmust act honestly, I have a commitment.\n Satisfaction clauses don’t make a contract or promise illusory. Both objective \nand subjective satisfaction clauses satisfy the consideration requirement.\nAnalyzing output and requirements  \ncontracts\nAlthough the default rules can supply many missing contract terms (see \nChapter 10 for details), contract law has no default rule for quantity. The \ngeneral rule is that absence of a stated quantity is fatal to a contract, because \nwithout knowing how much the seller had promised, computing the buyer’s \nremedy is impossible. The exception to this rule is that the quantity, even if \nnot expressly stated, may be determined by the output of the seller or the \nrequirements of the buyer.\n For example, suppose a lumber mill promises its entire output of cedar shakes \n(roofing shingles) to a builder at a fixed price per bundle. Later, the market \nprice of cedar shakes goes up, and the seller wants to sell them to other \nbuyers for more money.\nThe seller claims that even though it had promised its entire output to the \nbuyer, it didn’t promise to have  an output, and therefore the quantity is  \n57  Chapter 3: Sealing the Deal: The Doctrine of Consideration\nillusory — if the seller can either produce the shakes or not, then consider -\nation is nonexistent.\nAccording to the UCC, however, the contract is enforceable even though \nthe quantity isn’t stated as a certain amount but is rather measured by the \noutput of the seller or the requirements of the buyer. Section 2-306(1), as \nenacted in North Carolina at 25-2-306(1) provides:\n§ 25-2-306. Output, requirements and exclusive dealings.\n(1) A term which measures the quantity by the output of the seller or the \nrequirements of the buyer means such actual output or requirements as \nmay occur in good faith, except that no quantity unreasonably dispropor -\ntionate to any stated estimate or in the absence of a stated estimate to \nany normal or otherwise comparable prior output or requirements may \nbe tendered or demanded.\nIn the case of the cedar shakes and in accordance with this statute, the quan -\ntity is determined by the following:\n ✓ Good faith:  The quantity of shakes should reflect the quantity the \nlumber mill is able to produce.\n ✓ Comparable amounts from previous years:  If the price of shakes rises, \nthe builder may, in good faith, require more of them, but the lumber mill \nmay have historical demand that limits the number of shakes the builder \ncan reasonably demand to purchase at that price.\nSpotting illusory promises in settlements\nA settlement is a type of contract referred to as a release.  The “plaintiff” agrees \nto release his claim in exchange for something from the “defendant” — typically \na promise of money. If you were to illustrate the agreement, this bargained-for \nexchange diagram for the release would look something like Figure 3-3.\n Figure 3-3:  \nBargained-\nfor \nexchange \nin a release \n(settlement).\n Plaintiff DefendantRelinquish claim\n$$$\nBut suppose that after the parties agree to the release, the defendant dis -\ncovers that the plaintiff really didn’t have a valid claim and, as a result, had",10334
28-Evaluating the Recital of Consideration in a Contract Term.pdf,28-Evaluating the Recital of Consideration in a Contract Term,"58 Part I: Introducing Contract Law and Contract Formation \noffered nothing in exchange for the defendant’s promise of money. Therefore, \nthe defendant claims, the plaintiff’s promise was illusory.\nThe courts usually resolve this problem by inquiring into the plaintiff’s good \nfaith, his motive for entering the settlement. If he honestly believed he had a \nclaim, then he acted in good faith, which is sufficient consideration, and the \ncourt doesn’t disturb the release agreement.\n For example, in the notorious case of Fiege v. Boehm,  Boehm claimed that Fiege \nwas the father of her child. He entered into a release, agreeing to make sup -\nport payments in return for her agreeing to give up claims against him. He then \n(a little late!) had a blood test done and found that he couldn’t have fathered \nthe child. He stopped making payments, claiming that the release was illusory: \nBecause Boehm had no claim against him, no consideration existed for his prom -\nise. The court found that although Boehm had wrongly sought support from \nFiege, the contract was enforceable because she brought the claim in good faith.\nToo Many Blanks: Distinguishing \nContracts from Agreements to Agree\nAfter the parties have made what looks like a bargained-for exchange, you have \nto examine what they’ve exchanged to determine whether it’s too indefinite to \nconstitute consideration. If an agreement has too many indefinite terms, then a \ncourt can’t determine what the parties promised each other, so it has to refuse \nto enforce the agreement. The parties might have made either of the following:\n ✓ An agreement to agree:  The parties don’t intend to have an agreement \nuntil they’ve made the terms definite.\n ✓ An agreement with terms omitted:  The parties intend to have an agree -\nment, and the court tries to fill in the missing terms if the parties don’t. \nIf the court can find an objective standard to use to determine the miss -\ning term, then there’s an agreement.\n For example, assume that I say to you, “I’ll sell you my bicycle at a price to \nbe determined later,” and you say, “It’s a deal.” Apparently, we’ve exchanged \npromises, but what we’ve agreed to is unclear. We may be saying that we \ndon’t have a deal if we can’t agree to the price, or we may be saying we have  \na deal and we expect that price term to be supplied.\nContract law doesn’t have very good ways to determine whether the parties \nintended to make an agreement to agree. In the absence of language of the \nparties making it clear, look at the context for the degree of commitment and \nthe number of missing terms.\n59  Chapter 3: Sealing the Deal: The Doctrine of Consideration\n For example, a motion picture company sued actress Pamela Anderson for \nagreeing to star in a movie called Hello, She Lied  and then backing out. Pamela \nclaimed that they had only an agreement to agree. The court found that \nbecause the parties had failed to complete the Nudity Rider that would spell \nout how much nudity would be in the movie, the parties had not committed \nthemselves. No commitment = no consideration = no contract.\nIf a court has difficulty filling in what the parties would’ve agreed to, this fact \noften leads to the conclusion that the parties have an agreement to agree. For \nexample, in our agreement for the sale of the bicycle, coming up with a rea -\nsonable price for the bicycle would be relatively easy, but coming up with the \nterms of Anderson’s contract would’ve been difficult. In Chapter 10, I further \nexplain how a court fills in the terms of the agreement after determining that \nthe parties have an agreement.\nLooking for Consideration Substitutes: \nEnforcing without Consideration\nThe fact that consideration is missing doesn’t necessarily mean absence of \ncontract. Occasionally, the legislature enacts a statute that makes certain \npromises enforceable without consideration. For example, the UCC firm offer \nrule,  § 2-205, contains a narrow exception to the rule that an option contract \nrequires consideration. (For info on option contracts, see Chapter 2.) As \nenacted in North Carolina as § 25-2-205, it provides the following:\n§ 25-2-205. Firm offers.\nAn offer by a merchant to buy or sell goods in a signed writing which by \nits terms gives assurance that it will be held open is not revocable, for \nlack of consideration, during the time stated or if no time is stated for a \nreasonable time, but in no event may such period of irrevocability exceed \nthree months; but any such term of assurance on a form supplied by the \nofferee must be separately signed by the offeror.\nNote that under this statute, the offeror can’t revoke the offer even though no \nconsideration is given for it. However, the statute stipulates a number of limi -\ntations on such an offer, including that it\n ✓ Applies only to an offer by a merchant\n ✓ Applies only to an offer to buy or sell goods\n ✓ Must be in a signed writing\n ✓ Must by its terms give assurance that it will be held open\n ✓ Is irrevocable for only a limited time (a reasonable time but no more \nthan three months)\n60 Part I: Introducing Contract Law and Contract Formation \nIf an offeror jumps through these statutory hoops, then she’s made an offer \nthat’s not revocable even though the offeree has provided no consideration. \nWhy? Because the legislature says so. Why would the legislature say so? This \nUCC section is a good example of Uniform Commercial Code methodology. \nThe Code doesn’t want to regulate contracts; it wants to facilitate the process \nby reflecting what goes on in the commercial world. In the commercial world, \nmerchants make offers that offerees expect them not to revoke, so the Code \nmakes this practice the rule.\nSometimes courts use policies to plug the gaps when consideration is miss -\ning. They use the concept of reliance,  or promissory estoppel,  as an alternate \ntheory for the enforcement of promises — consideration may be unnecessary \nif the promisee changes position in reliance on a promise. For info on the \nconcept of reliance, turn to Chapter 4.\nEvaluating the Recital of Consideration  \nin a Contract Term\nA recital of consideration  is a statement in a contract that spells out a consid -\neration. For example, the statement may say that “for $1 and other good and \nvaluable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged,” one of \nthe parties agrees to do something. Recital of consideration is neither neces -\nsary nor sufficient to establish consideration:\n ✓ Not necessary:  A contract doesn’t have to include a recital of consider -\nation or even use the word “consideration.” Consideration simply needs \nto exist for contract formation.\n ✓ Not sufficient:  A contract may include a recital of consideration, but if \nthe recital refers to a nominal consideration, it doesn’t qualify as con -\nsideration (see the section “Spotting a phony: Nominal consideration,” \nearlier in this chapter).\n You may not be able to tell whether consideration is nominal just by looking \nat the recital of consideration in the contract, so investigate the background \nof how the transaction came about. In this inquiry, you must have a starting \npoint for the analysis. The starting point, or default rule, is that the recital of \nconsideration, even recital of $1, is presumed to be enforceable. For example, \nthe California Civil Code provides in § 1614 that “A written instrument is pre -\nsumptive evidence of a consideration.”\n61  Chapter 3: Sealing the Deal: The Doctrine of Consideration\nBut that presumption is rebuttable. The California Evidence Code § 622 provides\nThe facts recited in a written instrument are conclusively presumed to be \ntrue as between the parties thereto, or their successors in interest; but \nthis rule does not apply to the recital of a consideration.\nIn other words, the person attacking the contract has the burden to prove \nthat the consideration was not real but nominal.\nYou may encounter an affirmative defense to contract called failure of con -\nsideration,  which is really a misnomer. Either consideration is present or it’s \nnot, and if it’s present, it can’t fail. Therefore, “failure of consideration” is \nactually an issue of contract performance (see Chapter 16), not contract for -\nmation. (For additional details about contract defenses, including affirmative \ndefenses, check out Chapter 5.)\n62 Part I: Introducing Contract Law and Contract Formation",8519

30-Examining Exceptions When Contracts Arent Necessary.pdf,30-Examining Exceptions When Contracts Arent Necessary,"Chapter 4\nNoting Exceptions: Promises \nEnforceable without a Contract\nIn This Chapter\n▶ Recognizing promises enforceable without a contract\n▶ Understanding the doctrine of reliance and why it matters\n▶ Sizing up cases that involve promissory estoppel\n▶ Recognizing the role of restitution in enforceable promises\nT \nhe equation for contract formation looks something like this (see \nChapters 2 and 3 for details):\nContract = Offer + Acceptance + Consideration\nBut contract law isn’t always so formulaic. People have obligations to one \nanother that extend beyond voluntary consent to enter agreements. As a \nresult, contract law must address some exceptions to the equation. This \nchapter explores those exceptions so you can recognize situations in which \nenforceable obligations exist without the formality of a contract.\nExamining Exceptions: When  \nContracts Aren’t Necessary\n The world of obligations encompasses more than just the obligations people \nvoluntarily consent to by entering contracts. Obligations also arise from other \nsources. A party can also bring a claim based on tort, reliance, or restitution:\n ✓ Tort:  A tort is a civil wrong unrelated to breach of contract. Society imposes \ntort obligations on its members, so everyone’s required to honor these \nobligations regardless of whether they’re willing to do so. Although you \nand I can’t make a contract without our mutual consent, we’re bound not to \ncommit the tort of harming each other despite our lack of formal agreement.\n64 Part I: Introducing Contract Law and Contract Formation \n  Tort law is generally beyond the scope of this book, although occasionally \na particular transaction gives rise to both tort and contract obligations. \nFor example, if I contract with a lawyer to perform certain tasks for me, \nthe lawyer’s obligation to perform those tasks arises from our contract. If \nshe doesn’t perform them, she may be in breach of contract. In addition, \ntort law imposes an obligation on the lawyer not to harm me. If she fails to \nlive up to that obligation, she may have committed the tort of malpractice.\n ✓ Reliance:  Reliance occurs when a party acts or refrains from acting based \non what someone else promises. For example, suppose a man tells his \nrecently widowed sister that if she moves, he’ll provide a place for her to \nlive. This promise is probably not enforceable because he didn’t bargain \nfor her performance. However, if she incurs expense in moving and he then \nrefuses to give her a place to live, the law of reliance kicks in. Even though \nhis promise may not be enforceable as a contract, he may be legally obli -\ngated to pay the expenses she incurred in relying  on his promise by moving.\n ✓ Restitution:  Restitution is the act of making a party disgorge (relinquish) \na benefit when one party has conferred a benefit on another. According to \nthe doctrine of restitution, one party is not allowed to unjustly enrich him -\nself at the expense of another. For example, in Mills v. Wyman  (see Chapter 3),  \nwhen Mills cared for Wyman’s adult son, Wyman incurred no contractual \nobligation because Mills didn’t bargain for anything in return for the ser -\nvices. But Mills is not out of luck — he has a claim against Wyman’s son in \nrestitution for the value of the benefit he conferred on him.\nThe following steps lead you through the process of determining whether \ntwo parties have a formal contract or are legally obligated by one of these \nfallback doctrines:\n 1. Look for a bargained-for contract.\n  A bargained-for contract must meet all the following conditions (see \nChapters 2 and 3 for details):\n  • The offeror made the offer to induce acceptance.\n  • The offeree gave acceptance to obtain what the offeror promised.\n  • Each party offered something the other wanted (consideration).\n  If a bargained-for contract exists and a party has breached the contract, \nthen the injured party is entitled to the expectancy  — the damages that \nput the injured party in the position she would’ve been in if the contract \nhad been performed. (For info on expectancy, see Chapter 16.)\n 2. Look for a claim based on reliance.\n  Even if there is no contact, if the promisee’s change in position cost him \nsomething, then he may have a claim in reliance  for compensation that \nputs him back in the position he was in before he relied on the promise. \n(Refer to the next section for details.)",4468
31-The Doctrine of Reliance Looking for a Promise That Induced Action.pdf,31-The Doctrine of Reliance Looking for a Promise That Induced Action,"65  Chapter 4: Noting Exceptions: Promises Enforceable without a Contract\n 3. Look for a claim based on restitution.\n  In the absence of a contract, restitution arises when one party confers a \nbenefit on another without intending it as a gift or forcing it on the other \nparty. If the person who received the benefit was unjustly enriched, then \nthe law requires that she disgorge  (relinquish) the benefit, returning \neach party to the position she was in before the benefit was conferred. \n(See “Deciding Cases That Test the Limits of Reliance: Promissory \nEstoppel,” later in this chapter, for details.)\n Reliance and restitution are not only stand-alone claims; they’re also remedies \nfor breach of contract, as I discuss in Part V.\nThe Doctrine of Reliance: Looking  \nfor a Promise That Induced Action\nReliance fits somewhat uncomfortably in the Restatement of Contracts, a com -\npilation of rules based on past judicial decisions (see Chapter 1 for details). \nThe Restatement begins by establishing the requirements for an enforceable \npromise through bargained-for contract. Then it says there’s more to contract \nformation than that: You can have an enforceable promise even without a  \nbargained-for contract. In other words, the Restatement accounts for the fact \nthat courts have enforced promises in the absence of bargained-for contracts.\nRestatement § 90(1) provides a good summary of the elements of claims that \nhave led courts to enforce promises based on reliance, which is also known \nas promissory estoppel.  It states the following:\n§ 90. Promise Reasonably Inducing Action Or Forbearance\n(1) A promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce \naction or forbearance on the part of the promisee or a third person and \nwhich does induce such action or forbearance is binding if injustice can \nbe avoided only by enforcement of the promise. The remedy granted for \nbreach may be limited as justice requires.\n Notice that § 90 is full of weasel words, including “reasonable,” “justice,” \nand “injustice.” The purpose here is to remain flexible. The Restatement is \nintended to provide guidance, not set rigid rules.\nEven if the situation meets all the conditions for reliance, the Restatement \nsays that the remedy for breach may be limited. The following subsections \nexplain the four conditions and the remedy limitation in detail.\n66 Part I: Introducing Contract Law and Contract Formation \n The Restatement isn’t a statute, so don’t try to use it as a statute. Courts are \nnot bound to follow it (though this particular section, Restatement § 90, may \nbe more closely followed than many other sections). Furthermore, the out -\ncome of any contract case depends not only on the rule but also on the facts, \nso outcomes may be very different depending on the facts involved. Think \ntwice before you say with authority, “The Restatement says. . . .” A court is \nfree to say, “We don’t care. The Restatement is not the law in this jurisdiction. \nPlease cite me some law I am bound to follow.” Still, the Restatement is a \nuseful tool for seeing the big picture and gaining a clearer understanding of \nhow judges approach these cases, so you can use the Restatement as a short -\ncut to determine what courts tend to look for.\nDetermining whether reliance applies\nAlthough Restatement § 90 is brief, it describes four conditions that must be \npresent to form an obligation based on the doctrine of reliance:\n ✓ It must include a promise.\n ✓ The promisor must reasonably expect the promise to induce action  \nor forbearance.\n ✓ The promise must be successful in inducing the expected action  \nor forbearance.\n ✓ Enforcement of the promise must be the only way to avoid injustice.\nThis section covers these conditions in detail.\nFinding a promise\nReliance always starts with a promise, so the first step toward determining \nwhether reliance applies is to test the language for a promise (see Chapter 2). \nDoes the language contain a commitment to do or not to do something with \nthe expectation that the other party does something (action) or doesn’t do \nsomething (forbearance)?\n For example, if your rich uncle says, “I expect to be paying for your law school \neducation someday,” those words don’t contain enough commitment to rise \nto the level of a promise; they merely express a hope. But if he says, “I’ll set \nup a trust to cover your law school tuition and expenses,” that’s a promise \nintended to induce action (preparing to go to law school).\n A promise isn’t an offer if it doesn’t ask for anything in return.\nAsking whether the action or forbearance was reasonable to expect\nAssuming the language contains a promise, the next step in finding out \nwhether reliance applies is to determine whether the action or forbearance \nis reasonable to expect. Ask whether a reasonable person in the shoes of the \n67  Chapter 4: Noting Exceptions: Promises Enforceable without a Contract\npromisor would’ve thought the promisee would do or not do what the promi -\nsor expected because of the promise. If you answer yes, then the language \nmeets the second condition.\n Suppose your 10-year-old brother is complaining that he doesn’t have pocket \nmoney for ice cream, and your uncle tells him, “I’ll give you $1,000.” No rea -\nsonable person would expect your brother to take him seriously. On the other \nhand, if you were complaining that you didn’t have enough money to get the \nsupplies you needed for law school, a reasonable person would expect your \nuncle to follow through on a promise to give you $1,000 to cover the expenses.\nDetermining whether the promise really did induce action or forbearance\nThe next element of reliance is simple: Did the promisee act or refrain from \nacting because of the promise? This is especially important in terms of the \nremedy. You must determine what the promisee did or didn’t do in reliance \non the promise and at what cost to the promisee. (For more about remedy, \nsee “Limiting the remedy for breach of the promise,” later in this chapter.)\nAsking whether injustice is avoided only by enforcing the promise\nThe final condition for reliance is that the promise is binding “if injustice can \nbe avoided only by enforcement of the promise.” Ask whether enforcing the \npromise is in the best interest of justice even though the parties fell short of \nforming a contract.\n Look at the example of Williston’s tramp, which I first present in Chapter 2. \nA wealthy man tells a tramp that if the tramp walks around the corner, the \nman will buy the tramp an overcoat. Williston concludes that consideration \nis absent, because the man was very unlikely to be bargaining for the tramp’s \nperformance. The tramp may use the fallback argument and say, “Okay, we \nhad no bargained-for contract. Nevertheless, you made a promise and I took \nsome action in reasonable reliance on it. So pay up.”\nThe problem is that the tramp did very little — he just walked around the \ncorner. But suppose your uncle told you, “I’m going to give you $3,000 so \nyou don’t have to spend your valuable time doing that work-study job while \nyou’re in school.” If you’ve given up the job in reliance on that promise, then \nonly by enforcing the promise is justice served.\nLimiting the remedy for  \nbreach of the promise\n In cases that involve an enforceable promise but no bargained-for contract, \nexpect the courts to limit the remedy to whatever the injured party lost \nas a result of reasonable reliance on the promise. As the final sentence of \nRestatement § 90(1) states, “The remedy granted for breach may be limited  \nas justice requires.”\n68 Part I: Introducing Contract Law and Contract Formation \n Suppose that your rich uncle says to you, “I hear you’re going to law school! \nThat’s great! I’ll give you $1,000 to help out.” In reasonable reliance on his \npromise, you buy $200 worth of study aids, including, of course, Contract Law \nFor Dummies.  He then announces a change of mind and tells you that he’s not \ngoing to pay you anything.\nClearly, you and your uncle don’t have a bargained-for contract, because he \ndidn’t bargain for anything from you. You can fall back on reliance, however, \nbecause your uncle’s promise induced you to do something — in this case, to \npurchase $200 worth of study aids. Therefore, his promise becomes enforceable.\nHow much is the remedy? Nowadays, courts generally limit recovery to the \nextent of the reliance. So you’d most likely recover $200 in your reliance \nclaim against your uncle, not the $1,000 he promised.\nOf course, in a situation where measuring the extent of the reliance is dif -\nficult, enforcing the promise may be the best option in terms of justice. For \nexample, in a case where an employer promised an employee a pension of \n$200 per month when she retired, the employee retired and became virtu -\nally unemployable. The employer changed its mind and stopped paying the \npension, claiming it had no contractual obligation. The court found that the \nparties had no bargained-for contract, but it also found that the employer \nshould’ve reasonably expected her to rely on the promise. Although the \ncourt didn’t discuss the extent of the reliance, measuring what the employee \nhad done or not done in reliance would be difficult or impossible, so enforc -\ning the promise to pay $200 per month seems just.\nIt wasn’t always this way: Counting  \nreliance as consideration\nThe final sentence of Restatement § 90(1), which \nmentions limits on the remedy when someone \nbreaches an enforceable promise, is relatively \nnew. It did not appear in the First Restatement, \nwhich was drafted in the 1920s. Apparently \nthe principal author of the First Restatement, \nSamuel Williston, equated reliance with con -\nsideration. If a promisor was found in breach of \nan enforceable promise, the court would usu -\nally require the promisor to honor the promise in full; if your uncle promised to pay $1,000, that’s \nwhat he owed you regardless of how much you \nspent in reliance.\nWhen the Second Restatement appeared in \n1981, the drafters added the final sentence to \nSubsection (1), reflecting the fact that courts \nnow typically limit the remedy to the monetary \nvalue of whatever the injured party lost as a \nresult of reliance on the promise.",10391
32-Deciding Cases That Test the Limits of Reliance Promissory Estoppel.pdf,32-Deciding Cases That Test the Limits of Reliance Promissory Estoppel,"69  Chapter 4: Noting Exceptions: Promises Enforceable without a Contract\nDeciding Cases That Test the Limits  \nof Reliance: Promissory Estoppel\nReliance is also called promissory estoppel  — promissory  because it deals \nwith a promise and estoppel  because the promisee’s reliance on the promise \nprevents (estops) the promisor from denying the legal effect of that promise \nmerely because consideration is absent.\nThe courts have struggled with numerous difficult cases to determine whether \nthey should hold promisors liable on this theory. This section explains several \ntypes of common cases in which promissory estoppel comes into play.\nDeciding whether a charitable  \npledge is enforceable\nThe question of whether a charitable pledge (promise) is enforceable has no \neasy answer. A wise dean may say, “If you promise $10,000 to the law school \nbuilding fund, we’ll put a plaque up in your honor.” Assuming the prospective \ndonor agrees, the two parties have a bargained-for contract, and the future \ndonor is obviously bound by contract to follow through with the donation.\nMost of the time, however, the narrative goes something like this: Someone \nat the not-for-profit sends a letter requesting a pledge. The prospective donor \npledges a specific amount of money, say $10,000, to the law school building \nfund. On its surface, this doesn’t qualify as a bargained-for contract, and the \nperson who made the pledge may refuse to perform.\nNevertheless, courts are sympathetic to enforcing a charitable promise, and they \nlook for some basis to enforce it. The dean may claim, for example, that by com -\nmitting to have construction begin, he reasonably relied on the promise.\nRestatement § 90 even has a special subsection devoted to charitable prom -\nises. Subsection (2) states that “A charitable subscription . . . is binding \nunder Subsection (1) without proof that the promise induced action or for -\nbearance.” In other words, the court doesn’t care whether consideration  \nor reliance exists — it’s going to enforce the charitable pledge because it  \nconsiders doing so good policy.\n The Restatement is not the law. A court is free to refuse to enforce a chari -\ntable pledge in the absence of reliance on it.\n70 Part I: Introducing Contract Law and Contract Formation \nDeciding whether a sophisticated  \nparty can claim reliance\nMost reliance cases involve a person who’s not very sophisticated in distin -\nguishing the subtle differences between contracts and gift promises. Assuming \nthat the promisee relies on a promise, the law turns what would otherwise \nbe a gift promise into an enforceable promise. Courts are much less likely to \nfind reliance in cases involving sophisticated parties, such as two people in \nbusiness. These parties ought to know better than to rely on a promise, so the \npromisor wouldn’t reasonably expect the promisee to rely on the promise.\n For example, if a franchisor says to a franchisee, “We’re going to give you a \nfranchise,” the promisee should know that businesses don’t give away fran -\nchises for nothing; they expect something in return. In the famous case of \nHoffman v. Red Owl,  however, the franchisees kept being told they would get \nthe franchise, but they had to do just one more thing first. After they jumped \nthrough a series of hoops, the franchisor said, “Sorry, no franchise for you.”The death and resurrection of contracts:  \nIs consideration required?\nIn his book The Death of Contract,  Grant Gilmore \nexplains how the drafters of the First Restatement \nof Contracts in the 1920s came to include two \nrules in it: one saying that consideration was \nrequired for an enforceable contract and one \nsaying that consideration was not required:\n  A good many years ago Professor Corbin \ngave me his version of how this unlikely com -\nbination came about. When the Restaters \nand their advisors came to the definition of \nconsideration, Williston proposed in sub -\nstance what became § 75. Corbin submitted \na quite different proposal. . . . Corbin, who \nhad been deeply influenced by Cardozo, \nproposed to the Restaters what might be \ncalled a Cardozoean definition of consid -\neration — broad, vague and, essentially, \nmeaningless — a common-law equivalent \nof causa,  or cause. In the debate Corbin and \nthe Cardozoeans lost out to Williston and the Holmesians. In Williston’s view, that should \nhave been the end of the matter. . . .\n  Instead, Corbin returned to the attack. \nAt the next meeting of the Restatement \ngroup, he addressed them more or less \nin the following manner: Gentlemen, you \nare engaged in restating the common law \nof contracts. You have recently adopted a \ndefinition of consideration. I now submit to \nyou a list of cases — hundreds, perhaps \nor thousands? — in which courts have \nimposed contractual liability under circum -\nstances in which, according to your defini -\ntion, there would be no consideration and \ntherefore no liability. Gentlemen, what do \nyou intend to do about these cases?\nThe answer is that the drafters of the \nRestatement embodied in that work the concept \nof reliance, or promissory estoppel, as an alter -\nnate theory for the enforcement of promises.",5261
33-The Doctrine of Restitution Creating an Obligation to Prevent Unjust Enrichment.pdf,33-The Doctrine of Restitution Creating an Obligation to Prevent Unjust Enrichment,"71  Chapter 4: Noting Exceptions: Promises Enforceable without a Contract\nThe court found that although no contract was formed, the franchisees had \nacted in reasonable reliance on these promises and were able to recover for \ntheir losses. Note, however, that even though setting up a franchise is a busi -\nness deal with a lot of money at stake, the franchisee has very little bargaining \npower and may, for this purpose, be considered an unsophisticated party.\nRemembering that reliance doesn’t  \nusually qualify as acceptance\n Reliance isn’t a viable fallback option when an offeree fails to accept an offer. \nYou have to accept an offer, not simply rely on it, to make it enforceable.\n For example, suppose I offer you 10,000 pens for $10,000, and you don’t express \nacceptance. Minutes later, you decide to open a pen store. You rent space at \nthe local mall and sink some money into advertising. You show up at my door, \nand before you have a chance to utter a word, I say, “I revoke my offer.”\nI successfully exercised my right to revoke the offer at any time before accep -\ntance. You may say, “But I relied  on your offer,” as evidenced by renting office \nspace and taking out advertising, but I would assert, and the courts would \nagree, that you shouldn’t have relied on the offer; you should’ve accepted it \nby promising to pay me the $10,000 I had requested.\nNote the difference between a promise and an offer. By presenting an offer I \nmade a promise, but as an offer, it called for acceptance and consideration — \nin this case, your promise to pay me $10,000. You knew you had to accept the \noffer, not rely on it, to make it enforceable. If you wanted some time to think \nit over, you should’ve entered into an option contract by paying me a consid -\neration to keep my offer open (see Chapter 2 for details).\nThe Doctrine of Restitution: Creating an \nObligation to Prevent Unjust Enrichment\nContract law is always on the watch for anything that seems unfair, including \nunjust enrichment  — when one party unfairly gains a benefit at another party’s \nexpense. To prevent or mitigate unjust enrichment, the courts rely on the doc -\ntrine of restitution,  doing whatever’s required to compensate both parties fairly \nor return them to their original positions prior to their dispute. This section \nreveals how the courts use restitution to deal with unjust enrichment.\n72 Part I: Introducing Contract Law and Contract Formation \nBattling unjust enrichment with  \nthe implied-in-law contract\nOne tool the courts use to prevent unjust enrichment is the implied-in-law \ncontract,  or quasi (pseudo)  contract — an obligation the law imposes on the \nparties when the parties haven’t entered into a formal agreement.\nAn implied-in-law contract must meet the following three conditions:\n ✓ Services must not be performed as a gift.\n ✓ Services cannot be forced on a party.\n ✓ The obligation formed by the implied-in-law contract must prevent \nunjust enrichment.\n Don’t confuse the implied-in-law  contract with the implied-in-fact  contract. An \nimplied-in-fact contract is a real contract (that is, a bargained-for contract) \nfound in the conduct of the parties rather than in their words (see Chapter 2). \nAn implied-in-law contract is not a bargained-for contract but an obligation \nbased on restitution.\n The classic example of an implied-in-law contract occurs when a doctor renders \nemergency medical services to a comatose patient and then bills the patient for \nthose services. The patient may emerge from the coma and say something like, \n“Too bad, but I never agreed to pay for those services.” However, contract law \nwould likely side with the doctor to prevent unjust enrichment — the patient’s \nreceiving medical treatment without giving the doctor anything in return. \nSomeone may claim that the treatment was forced on the patient, but the courts \nwould argue otherwise, stating that any reasonable person in the doctor’s \nshoes would’ve concluded that had the patient been conscious, he would’ve \nrequested the services and is therefore obligated to pay.\nOn the other hand, if I mow your lawn without your asking me to do so and \nthen claim that I conferred a benefit on you for which you should compen -\nsate me, the law would say that my act was officious  — performed without \nyour consent — in which case you’re not obligated to pay for it. Society \ndoesn’t want businesses to go around forcing people to accept services and \nthen demanding payment.\n Although the reasonable value of services in a particular situation is not \nalways clear, reasonable value of the benefit conferred is always the starting \npoint for measuring the recovery in restitution.\n73  Chapter 4: Noting Exceptions: Promises Enforceable without a Contract\nAwarding restitution for saving a life?\nA restitution issue arises when one person \nclaims that another has a “moral obligation” \nto pay for a benefit conferred. Today people \ntry to stick to looking at legal obligations, but \nthe legacy of past cases remains. In Webb v. \nMcGowin,  a 1923 Alabama case, Webb, an \nemployee of McGowin, was in the process of \nthrowing a block and tackle (rope and pulley \nsystem) from a loft when he saw his employer, \nMcGowin, moving directly into the path of the \nfalling object. To save McGowin from injury, \nWebb threw himself at the falling block and \ntackle, diverting it so it missed McGowin, but \nseverely injuring himself in the process. In \nthose days workers’ compensation was non -\nexistent, but McGowin promised to pay Webb \n$15 every two weeks for the rest of Webb’s life. \nMcGowin made the payments until he died five \nyears later. When the executor of his estate \nrefused to continue the payments, claiming the \nestate had no contractual obligation to make \nthem, Webb sued.\nWebb had a lot of sympathy going for him but \nnot a lot of law. Obviously McGowin and Webb \nhad no bargained-for contract. Nor did Webb \nrely on the promise by McGowin; he had already \nacted before the promise was made. What \nabout “moral obligation” — does McGowin \nhave an obligation to pay Webb for a benefit \nconferred, even though the law didn’t require \nit? Today the courts would say no, because \nthey’re concerned only with legal obligations.\nBut what about restitution — didn’t Webb \nconfer a benefit on McGowin? One problem with \nthe restitution claim in this case is that society \ngenerally thinks that a person who saves some -\none’s life or commits a similar heroic act has \nconferred a gift on the person and is not entitled \nto compensation. Society honors heroes for their courage and sacrifice but doesn’t allow \nthem to recover from the person they saved. In \nthis case, however, McGowin promised to pay \nWebb. Does a promise by the person saved take \nwhat was otherwise a gift and change it into an \nenforceable promise? Maybe. For one thing, the \npromise makes the act appear less like a gift, \nbecause people generally don’t offer to pay for \ngifts. For another, because the recovery in res -\ntitution is the value of the benefit conferred, the \npromise puts a value on the act that otherwise \nwould be difficult to determine.\nIn this case, the court held that a contract was \nformed. That seems like nonsense to me, but it \nmay make sense to say that a promise in a situ -\nation like this is enforced as a kind of restitution \nwhere the value of the benefit conferred can’t \nbe determined. The result of the case has been \ncaptured in Restatement § 86, the principles of \nwhich can be summarized in the context of res -\ntitution as the following:\n ✓ If a benefit conferred is not a gift and not \nofficious, then the party who was unjustly \nenriched must pay the value of the benefit \nconferred. If the party who received the \nbenefit made a subsequent promise to pay, \nthe amount promised is irrelevant because \nthe claim is in restitution, not contract.\n ✓ If a benefit is conferred as a gift, as in the \ncase of most rescues, then neither claim in \nrestitution nor promise to enforce in con -\ntract is present.\n ✓ If a benefit is conferred and the person \nwho received the benefit made a subse -\nquent promise to pay, even if no claim in \nrestitution would exist, the promise may be \nenforceable in contract to the extent nec -\nessary to prevent injustice.\n74 Part I: Introducing Contract Law and Contract Formation \n Apparently in the good old days, doctors commonly set fees based on each \npatient’s ability to pay. In one particular case, after rendering services on an \nunconscious person, a doctor discovered that the person was very wealthy \nand sent him an inflated bill. The court held that the doctor and patient \ncould’ve contracted for that amount, but when the claim is based on an \nimplied-in-law contract, the measure of the recovery is the value of the  \nbenefit conferred rather than what the contract price would’ve been.\nDetermining when a court is likely  \nto find unjust enrichment\nWhenever one party confers a benefit on another that’s not a gift and not offi -\ncious (forced upon the recipient), then look to a claim based in restitution. \nCourts commonly award restitution when parties enter a contract and then \none of the parties successfully asserts a contract defense that destroys the \nclaim that the parties made a bargain (see Part II for info on contract defenses); \nthe court then tries to restore the parties to their positions prior to contract \nformation. In doing so, the court employs the principle of restitution.\n For example, if I orally agree to buy your house for $100,000 and give you a \ndown payment of $5,000, you may correctly claim that our contract is not \nenforceable because it was oral. (As I explain in Chapter 7, all real estate con -\ntracts must be evidenced by a writing.) You win that particular battle, but now \nyou have $5,000 of my money that I didn’t hand you as a gift nor confer on you \nofficiously, so I ought to get it back. Because we have no contract, the proper \nclaim is in restitution — you keep your house, and I get my $5,000 back.\nSorting out restitution in a material breach\nThe restitution issue arises when a party can’t make a contract claim because \nshe’s materially breached the contract. (A material breach  is any failure by the \nbreaching party that’s significant enough to give the injured party the right \nnot to perform his part of the contract.) In such cases, the court may compel \nthe injured party to provide restitution in an amount equal to the benefit that \nthe breaching party conferred on the injured party. (See Chapter 14 for more \nabout material breach.)\n For example, suppose I hire a contractor to build a house for me for $200,000. \nThe contractor builds 40 percent of the house and then stops. Obviously, the \ncontractor can’t recover from me on the contract because he’s completed so \nlittle of the project. That’s a material breach.\n75  Chapter 4: Noting Exceptions: Promises Enforceable without a Contract\nBut I did receive a benefit. Hiring another contractor to finish building the \nhouse may cost me only $120,000. Should I get to keep the benefit conferred \nby the dirty contract-breaker without paying for it? Authority is split on this \nquestion, but the modern view is to allow the party who breaches a contract \nto recover in restitution for the benefit conferred. In this case, the courts \nwould likely order me to pay the first contractor $80,000. The contrary view \nis that he has committed a wrong, and a wrongdoer should not be able to \nmake an equitable claim.\nOf course, because the contractor is in the wrong, my recovering my expec -\ntancy damages (putting me where I would’ve been had the contract been \nperformed) takes priority over his getting restitution. If he claimed that he \nspent $100,000 building the house before he quit and completing it cost me \n$120,000, he gets only $80,000 in restitution because I’m entitled to get what I \nbargained for — the house for $200,000.\n76 Part I: Introducing Contract Law and Contract Formation",12163

36-Leveraging the Power of Policies.pdf,36-Leveraging the Power of Policies,"Chapter 5\nIntroducing Contract Defenses\nIn This Chapter\n▶ Appreciating contract law policies\n▶ Understanding the legislature’s role in regulating contracts\n▶ Understanding the courts’ role in policing contracts and interpreting statutes\n▶ Looking into affirmative defenses\nA \n contract defense  is a challenge to a contract’s formation and enforce -\nability. For example, suppose you’re a plaintiff trying to get a court to \nenforce a contract you think I’ve breached. You present your case and prove \nwe formed a contract through offer, acceptance, and consideration (see \nPart I of the book for details). Even so, the contract isn’t necessarily valid or \nenforceable. I have the opportunity to present a contract defense — to offer \nproof claiming that certain facts undermine the contract’s formation and \ndestroy its enforceability.\nThese facts typically have less to do with the three elements of contract for -\nmation (offer, acceptance, and consideration) and more to do with policies \nadopted by courts and regulations enacted by federal or state legislatures. \nThis chapter introduces and explains these policies and regulations so you’re \nbetter equipped to challenge a contract’s validity or defeat that challenge. \nThe remaining chapters in this part focus on specific policies and regulations \nthat influence decisions in contract cases.\nLeveraging the Power of Policies\n Contract law has four key policies that guide the courts in deciding whether \ncontracts or terms are enforceable by law:\n ✓ Freedom of contract\n ✓ Efficiency\n ✓ Fairness\n ✓ Predictability\n80 Part II: Determining Whether a Contract Is Void, Voidable, or Unenforceable \nNo single policy takes precedence over another in all cases. In fact, contract \nlaw is often an attempt to reconcile competing policies. As an attorney, you \ncan use this idea to your client’s advantage, as long as you understand the dif -\nferent policies and how the courts are likely to reconcile competing policies.\nFreedom of contract\nFreedom of contract is the most basic principle governing contract law. It \ngives everyone of legal age and ability the freedom to bargain fairly for con -\ntracts allowable by law.\nAll other things being equal, freedom of contract rules the roost. If two par -\nties agree to a deal that passes the formation requirements (which I outline \nin Part I), it’s enforceable in a court of law. However, the law has the power \nto scrutinize the agreement to make sure that nothing about it is illegal or \nunfair. If a deal is lopsided enough, a court may inquire into it based on the \nprinciple of fairness.\n As you explore the various devices courts use to overturn agreements, \nremember that freedom of contract includes the freedom to make a bad deal. \nIf nothing’s wrong with the transaction other than the fact that one party \nagreed to sell something for a lot less than it’s worth, the law should let the \nagreement stand.\nEfficiency\nThe principle of efficiency facilitates the free and fair exchange of goods \nand services. Generally, freedom of contract ensures economic efficiency, \nbecause parties freely bargain for what they want to get out of the transac -\ntion. The assumption is that each party agrees only to what’s in her best \ninterest. But if one party engages in certain conduct that takes advantage \nof the other party (unfair conduct), the efficiency of the transaction may be \nimpaired, both in terms of economics and justice.\nYou need to look at efficiency both in terms of freedom of contract and fair -\nness. If I have a car worth $10,000 and I agree to sell it to you for $100, an \neconomist may say the deal was efficient because $100 had more utility than \nthe car had for me and obviously the car had more efficiency than your $100 \nhad for you. On the other hand, inquiring minds want to know whether such \na deal is fair: Something seems fishy about the transaction. Why would I sell  \na $10,000 car for $100? Was something illegal going on? Did you hold a gun  \nto my head and make me agree? Was I out of my mind at the time? These \nfacts would show that the agreement wasn’t economically efficient because  \nI wasn’t able to maximize my interests.",4233
37-Making the Most of Statutes.pdf,37-Making the Most of Statutes,"81  Chapter 5: Introducing Contract Defenses\nFairness\nThe principle of fairness is designed to keep one party from making a sucker \nof the other, perhaps by slipping terms into the contract that are unfavorable \nto the other party or that the other party is unlikely to read or understand.\nOf course, you can’t merely claim that a contract or term is unfair; you must \nfashion a legal argument that indicates precisely what’s offensive about the \ntransaction. Chapter 6 exposes you to contract practices and terms deemed \nillegal or unfair to assist you in gauging the legality, fairness, and enforceabil -\nity of a contract and its terms.\nPredictability\nThe principle of predictability facilitates contract planning. It provides every -\none involved in contract law with the secure knowledge that if you enter into \na transaction in a particular way or use certain words, then the outcome is \nthe same as it has been in the past. Courts generally follow this rule, which \ngoes by the Latin name of stare decisis,  which means “let the decision stand.”\nBut different contract cases arise under different facts, and a court may apply \na rule to one set of facts that it doesn’t apply to another set of facts. As a \nresult, contract law isn’t always as predictable as most people want it to be.\n For example, what level of quality can the buyer of a used car expect? Assume \nan automobile wholesaler sells a car to a used-car lot, the used-car dealer sells \nthat car to a consumer, and the buyer sells the car to a friend. The transac -\ntions involve the sale of the same car, but in the first transaction, the parties \nare sophisticated commercial parties; in the second, they’re a sophisticated \ncommercial party and a consumer; and in the third, they’re two unsophisti -\ncated parties. In these different circumstances, you can’t assume that a court \nwill apply the same rule in the same way.\nMaking the Most of Statutes\nContract law has two layers: common law and statutes. Common law  is \nany collection of laws established by prior judicial decisions (precedents). \nStatutes,  which federal and state legislatures have the power to pass, govern \nparticular transactions. These statutes may clarify, reinforce, or override the \ncommon law, so when you’re dealing with a contract defense, you need to be \naware of statutes that may be relevant to the defense.\n82 Part II: Determining Whether a Contract Is Void, Voidable, or Unenforceable \nIn this section, I explain how the authority of federal and state statutes differ \nand provide general guidance on how to make strategic use of these statutes \nto bring a contract claim.\nProtecting consumers with  \nstate and federal statutes\nContract law is traditionally state law. The federal government may \nget involved, however, because Congress has the authority under the \nConstitution to regulate interstate commerce, and many contracts involve \ninterstate transactions.\n Both federal and state legislatures have been active in enacting statutes that \napply to a consumer transaction  — a transaction that an individual enters into \nwith a business for personal, family, or household purposes. Here are a few \nexample transactions to help you tell whether you’re dealing with a consumer \ntransaction or something else:\n ✓ Consumer transaction:  You buy a car from a dealer. The dealer is a  \nbusiness, and you’re a consumer.\n ✓ Business-to-business transaction:  A used-car dealer buys a car from a \ndistributor. No consumer is involved, so it’s not a consumer transaction.\n ✓ Peer-to-peer transaction:  I buy a used car from you. In most jurisdic -\ntions, this doesn’t constitute a consumer transaction because neither \nparty is a business.\nFederal and state statutes are primarily for consumer protection, but they \ndiffer in the types of protection they afford consumers, as I explain next.\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Act\nThe United States Congress passed the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Act \nin 1914. The FTC Act very broadly forbids “unfair or deceptive acts or prac -\ntices” in interstate trade and commerce. Over the years, the FTC has adopted \nrules and guidelines that list the acts and practices the FTC considers unfair \nor deceptive for various industries.\nFor example, the FTC discovered that used-car dealers frequently made false \nor misleading statements about the condition of the cars they were selling \nand the warranties buyers were getting. As a result, the FTC now requires \nused-car dealers to put a sticker on the window of each car that clearly dis -\ncloses whether any warranty is provided, and if so, what it covers.\nThe FTC is primarily a consumer protection agency. Consumers may file \ncomplaints with the FTC to seek justice, but the FTC is likely to pursue only \n83  Chapter 5: Introducing Contract Defenses\nthe most significant claims. For individual recovery, consumers may need to \npursue a claim under the state law.\nState statutes\nAlthough the FTC can bring a complaint on behalf of a consumer, an individ -\nual doesn’t have a private right of action,  meaning that he can’t bring his own \nclaim under the FTC Act. Every state has solved this problem by enacting its \nown Consumer Protection Act that operates like a mini–FTC Act. Under the \nstate statutes, both a state agency and the consumer can bring a complaint. \nIn fact, in most jurisdictions, attorneys have an incentive to help consumers \nbring these claims, because if they’re successful, they can collect attorney’s \nfees from the losing defendant. (You may not appreciate that now, but you \nwill when you get into practice!)\nThe principal statute you encounter in contract law is Uniform Commercial \nCode (UCC) Article 2, which applies to the sales of goods. Most UCC provi -\nsions are not regulatory; they’re default rules  that apply in the absence of \nrules in the parties’ agreement.\n Most of the provisions of UCC Article 2 apply to transactions involving the \nsale of goods, regardless of whether the parties are merchants. Nevertheless, \na court may well apply a section differently depending on whether the trans -\naction involves two sophisticated parties, a sophisticated party and an unso -\nphisticated party, or two unsophisticated parties.\nContract law in the U.S. Constitution\nThe United States Constitution has little to \nsay about contracts. The Contract Clause — \nArticle I, Section 10, Clause 1 — provides that \n“No state shall . . . pass any . . . Law Impairing \nthe Obligation of Contracts.” Although that may \nsound like the law should let people contract \nas they please, courts have applied the clause \nmuch more narrowly. The drafters were appar -\nently concerned about a widespread prac -\ntice under the old Articles of Confederation \nwhereby states would relieve individuals of \ntheir obligation to pay debts, particularly debts \nto foreign creditors.\nIn modern times, parties to contracts have chal -\nlenged the constitutionality of state regulations \nthat affect their contracts. The Supreme Court laid out a three-part test for whether a law vio -\nlates the Contract Clause in Energy Reserves \nGroup v. Kansas Power & Light , 459 U.S. 400 \n(1983). It allows the state to interfere with free -\ndom of contract if\n ✓ The state regulation does not substantially \nimpair a contractual relationship.\n ✓ The state has “a significant and legitimate \npurpose behind the regulation, such as the \nremedying of a broad and general social or \neconomic problem.”\n ✓ The law is reasonable and appropriate for \nits intended purpose.\nMost regulations have no problem overcoming \nthese hurdles and trump freedom of contract.",7718
38-Checking into Affirmative Defenses.pdf,38-Checking into Affirmative Defenses,"84 Part II: Determining Whether a Contract Is Void, Voidable, or Unenforceable \nTapping the power of statutes  \nto bring a contract claim\nAs an attorney, you need to be well versed in both federal and state statutes. \nIf a statute addresses a particular transaction or a particular term in the con -\ntract, check whether you can bring a claim under the statute in addition to or \nrather than the common law.\nFor example, an advertisement is not an offer (see Chapter 2 for details). If \nan ad induces you to go to a store and the store tells you it doesn’t have the \nadvertised goods and tries to steer you to other goods, you have no claim in \ncommon-law contracts. But this practice — called  bait and switch  — is likely \nto be a violation of a state Consumer Protection Act statute. And under that \nstatute, you may be entitled to enhanced remedies such as punitive damages \nand attorney’s fees.\n Before bringing a common-law contract claim, check the following to see \nwhether you can bring a claim under a statute instead:\n ✓ Does the transaction involve a consumer?\n ✓ Does a statute or regulation apply to this particular agreement?\nIf your claim meets either of these conditions, you have a good chance of \nbeing able to bring a claim under a statute. Some consumer protection stat -\nutes allow individuals to bring statutory claims on their own, whereas others \nallow only the state or federal consumer protection agencies to bring claims \non behalf of affected consumers. Of course, a statute often needs to be inter -\npreted, so researching any cases on point is also important.\n For example, suppose an attorney in Montana has a disabled client whose \nwheelchair doesn’t work properly. The attorney finds no cases on point but \nknows that UCC Article 2 applies because the transaction involves the sale \nof goods. The seller has complied with the Code statutes on the exclusion of \nwarranty, so the client appears to be out of luck. The attorney digs deeper and \ndiscovers that the Montana legislature has enacted a Wheelchair Warranty \nAct that may provide relief for a consumer in this situation.\nExamining the Courts’ Role  \nin Policing Contracts\nIn the United States, a government agency doesn’t need to approve a contract in \nadvance, and most of the time no statute regulates the contract. Assuming that \nnobody broke the law, as soon as the parties agree through offer, acceptance, \n85  Chapter 5: Introducing Contract Defenses\nand consideration, a contract is formed. The courts get involved only if one of \nthe parties challenges the contract in court.\nEven if both parties concede that the contract was formed through offer, \nacceptance, and consideration, one party may challenge the contract by \nclaiming that certain facts undermine its formation and destroy its enforce -\nability. In England, this is called vitiating  (taking the life out of) the contract. \nIn the U.S., we just call it establishing a defense to the contract.\n The general rule is that assuming the plaintiff has proven the formation of a \ncontract, it’s presumed  valid, but a presumption is just a starting point. If the \npresumption is rebuttable,  meaning capable of being proven invalid, then the \ndefendant has an opportunity to show that additional facts provide a defense \nto the contract,  as I explain next.\nChecking into Affirmative Defenses\nAccording to the Rules of Civil Procedure, the defendant must prove an affir-\nmative defense  — proof that effectively challenges the contract or its terms. \nRule 8(c) provides in part\n(c) Affirmative Defenses. In pleading to a preceding pleading, a party shall \nset forth affirmatively accord and satisfaction, arbitration and award, \nassumption of risk, contributory negligence, discharge in bankruptcy, \nduress, estoppel, failure of consideration, fraud, illegality, injury by fellow \nservant, laches, license, payment, release, res judicata, statute of frauds, \nstatute of limitations, waiver, and any other matter constituting an avoid -\nance or affirmative defense.\nNote that although the rule lists a number of defenses, it also states that a \nparty can prove “any other matter” that would be a defense to the contract.\nUCC Article 2 doesn’t state any rules that allow a party to assert a defense to \nthe formation of a contract for the sale of goods. Nevertheless, those rules are \nin the Code! Article 1, which applies to the other articles of the Code, provides \nthe following in § 1-103(b), as enacted in North Carolina at § 25-1-103(b):\n(b) Unless displaced by the particular provisions of [the Uniform \nCommercial Code], the principles of law and equity, including the law \nmerchant and the law relative to capacity to contract, principal and agent, \nestoppel, fraud, misrepresentation, duress, coercion, mistake, bankruptcy, \nand other validating or invalidating cause supplement its provisions.\n Section 1-103(b) is one of the most important provisions of the UCC. It specifies \nthat in a contract for the sale of goods under Article 2, where the Code doesn’t \nsupply a rule, you must read in “the principles of law and equity” — the rules \n86 Part II: Determining Whether a Contract Is Void, Voidable, or Unenforceable \nfrom the common law. So when dealing with an Article 2 (sale of goods) transac -\ntion, take the following steps:\n 1. Look for the rules in the Code.\n 2. If you can’t find a rule that applies, look to a statute that addresses the \nparticular transaction.\n 3. If you can’t find a statute, then look to the common law.\nIn this section, I provide general guidance for examining defenses to  \ncontract formation.\nDistinguishing valid, void,  \nand voidable contracts\n Depending on the outcome after applying an affirmative defense, a contract \nfalls into one of the following three categories:\n ✓ Valid:  Initially, a contract is presumed to be valid,  meaning that it’s \nenforceable under law.\n ✓ Void:  A contract is void if the affirmative defense provides sufficient evi -\ndence that no contract was formed due to additional facts. If a contract is \nvoid, it never was and never will be a valid contract. For example, suppose \nyou used fraud in the factum  (Latin for “fraud in the making”) to trick me \ninto signing a document I didn’t realize was a contract and then claimed \nthat I had agreed to buy your house. In such a case, the contract is void \nand we’re restored to our pre-contract positions; you get the house, and  \nI get my money.\n ✓ Voidable:  Most of the time, a contract that’s formed is voidable  if an \naffirmative defense is proven . This means that it was valid when formed, \nbut a party has the power to avoid or affirm the contract. For example, \nif you used the more common form of fraud, called fraud in the induce -\nment,  to get me to buy your house by representing that it had two work -\ning bathrooms when it had only one, I’d have the option of avoiding or \naffirming the contract:\n  • Avoid:  If I were to avoid the contract, I would render it ineffective \nby proving a defense to contract. The court restores us to our pre-\ncontract positions; you get the house, and I get my money.\n  • Affirm:  My other option is to affirm the contract, waiving my \ndefense. In that case, the contract is valid, and I may have a claim \nagainst you in tort for damages.\n87  Chapter 5: Introducing Contract Defenses\nSeparating matters of law  \nand matters of fact\nCourts may determine that contracts are void or voidable based on matters \nof law or matters of fact:\n ✓ Matters of law:  If a contract is void or voidable  as a matter of law,  the \nparty doesn’t have to prove any facts to show that the contract was viti -\nated, because it never was a contract. The law covers it. As a matter of \nlaw, a contract may be either void or voidable:\n  • Void:  An example of a contract that’s void as a matter of law arises \nwhen a person has gone through a court proceeding that deter -\nmines the individual is mentally incompetent, called an adjudica -\ntion of incompetence.  Because the legal system has decided that \nthe person is incapable of entering contracts, any contract he \nenters into is void as a matter of law.\n  • Voidable:  An example of a contract that’s voidable as a matter of \nlaw is one that a minor enters into. If you’re under 18, any con -\ntracts you enter into are valid, but you can avoid them without \nhaving to present a contract defense.\n ✓ Matters of fact:  If a contract is voidable as a matter of fact,  it starts as \na valid contract, and the party must prove the facts that vitiate it. If a \nperson hasn’t been adjudicated incompetent but claims she lacked the \nmental competence to enter a particular contract, then she must prove \nas a matter of fact that she wasn’t competent at the time she entered the \ncontract. For example, if Britney goes to Las Vegas, gets drunk out of her \nmind, and gets married, then after she sobers up, she can avoid the mar -\nriage contract by proving facts that show she was mentally incompetent \nat the time she entered it. If she had previously been adjudicated incom -\npetent, the contract would be void without need for further proof.\n As you consider specific contract defenses (which I cover in Chapters 6, 7,  \nand 8), ask yourself the following:\n ✓ Is the person claiming the defense trying to prove that the contract is \nvoid or voidable?\n ✓ Is the case proven as a matter of law,  or does the person have to prove it \nas a matter of fact?\n88 Part II: Determining Whether a Contract Is Void, Voidable, or Unenforceable",9629
39-Determining Enforceability When the Legislature Has Spoken.pdf,39-Determining Enforceability When the Legislature Has Spoken,"Chapter 6\nConsidering Whether an \nAgreement Is Unenforceable Due \nto Illegality or Unfairness\nIn This Chapter\n▶ Analyzing the degree of illegality in an agreement\n▶ Applying the concept of defenses based on public policy\n▶ Policing agreements with the doctrine of unconscionability\n▶ Checking contract terms against the doctrine of reasonable expectations\nC \nontract law has a number of competing policies. One important policy \nis freedom of contract,  which grants parties the right to make binding \nagreements. But another important policy is the police power  of the legisla -\nture and the courts — the power to determine whether the entire agreement \nor a term in an agreement is enforceable. To make that determination, courts \nmust consider these two policies and others.\nThis chapter reveals the most important considerations courts use to deter -\nmine the enforceability of an agreement or a term within the agreement:\n ✓ The legality of the agreement itself or more subtle violations of law that \nmay affect the enforceability of the agreement\n ✓ Whether the agreement or a term in it violates public policy\n ✓ Whether the agreement or a term in it is unconscionable (shocks the \nconscience of the court)\nIn examining these considerations, this chapter shows you what to be  \naware of when planning an agreement or deciding whether to challenge an \nexisting agreement.\n90 Part II: Determining Whether a Contract Is Void, Voidable, or Unenforceable \nDetermining Enforceability When  \nthe Legislature Has Spoken\nLegislatures may make certain agreements illegal to discourage undesirable \nconduct, but they must weigh the necessity of discouraging certain conduct \nagainst the parties’ right to form a contract. This section enables you to \nweigh the two for yourself and your clients.\nRecognizing illegal agreements  \nthat are unenforceable\nSometimes determining enforceability is easy: A particular agreement isn’t \nenforceable because the legislature says very clearly, “Don’t do this!” In such \ncases, society discourages undesirable conduct by making it illegal for the \nparties to enter an agreement. The legal system has the power to challenge \nagreements in three ways:\n ✓ Civil:  The agreement is void as a matter of law, so nobody can base a \ncontract claim on it.\n ✓ Criminal:  Parties may face a penalty for making the agreement.\n ✓ Procedural:  Using the courts to enforce such agreements is inappropriate.\n For example, consider a state statute that makes distribution of methamphet -\namine illegal. Suppose Walter agrees to sell Tuco a pound of meth for $40,000. \nTuco takes the meth but refuses to pay Walter, so Walter sues. Do the parties \nhave freedom of contract to make this agreement? Clearly not. Public policy \nagainst distributing dangerous drugs outweighs any interest in enforcing the \ncontract. You can find that policy in the fact that the legislature made it a \ncrime. On the civil side, the agreement is void, and on the criminal side, the \nparties may face charges for making the agreement. Furthermore, the courts \nwould look foolish if they supported Walter’s claim, so they’d likely toss him \nout of court on his ear.\n Most law students and lawyers carelessly use the words agreement  and con-\ntract interchangeably, but note the difference:\n ✓ An agreement  is what parties agree to, whether enforceable or not.\n ✓ A contract  is an enforceable agreement.\nAn agreement can be enforceable or not, but a contract by definition is \nenforceable. The Code makes this distinction in the definitions of agreement  \nand contract  in UCC § 1-201. Section 1-201(b)(3) as codified in North Carolina \nprovides the following:\n91\nChapter 6: Considering Unenforceability Due to Illegality or Unfairness\n“Agreement,” as distinguished from “contract,” means the bargain of the \nparties in fact, as found in their language or inferred from other circum -\nstances, including course of performance, course of dealing, or usage of \ntrade as provided in G.S. 25-1-303.\nSection 1-201(b)(12) as codified in North Carolina provides\n“Contract,” as distinguished from “agreement,” means the total legal \nobligation that results from the parties’ agreement as determined by this \nChapter [the Uniform Commercial Code] as supplemented by any other \napplicable laws.\nSo using these words in this sense, parties can make an agreement in fact to \nsell drugs or to restrain trade, but they’re not making a contract because in \nlaw these obligations are not enforceable.\n Consider a business accused of making an agreement with another business in \nviolation of the antitrust law, which prohibits agreements that restrain trade. \nThe defense claims that because the agreement was void, they didn’t make an \nagreement, so no violation! Of course, this defense doesn’t hold up in court, \nbecause of the difference between an agreement  and a contract. The parties,  \nin fact, made an agreement.\nNoting exceptions: Illegal but  \nenforceable agreements\nNot every agreement that involves illegality is unenforceable. Recall that \nsociety is trying to balance two interests: the freedom-of-contract interest in \nenforcement of the agreement and the public policy interest against enforce -\nment. The policy behind making agreements illegal is to discourage undesir -\nable conduct. But sometimes the interest in enforcing the bargain, either in \nwhole or in part, outweighs the interest in discouraging the conduct.\n To determine which interest — freedom of contract or public policy — carries \nmore weight, courts typically consider the following factors:\n ✓ The expectations of the parties; that is, what they had hoped to gain by \nentering into the agreement\n ✓ Whether failure to enforce the agreement would result in forfeiture  —  \nan out-of-pocket loss — by the party seeking enforcement\n ✓ Any public interest in enforcement\nThis section describes situations in which agreements may be enforceable \naccording to one, two, or all three of these factors, despite being illegal.\n92 Part II: Determining Whether a Contract Is Void, Voidable, or Unenforceable \nWhen one party is innocent\nA court may decide that the interest in enforcement of an agreement out -\nweighs the interest in non-enforcement when non-enforcement would harm \nthe person the policy of the law was designed to protect. Sometimes one of \nthe parties to an illegal agreement is innocent of any wrongdoing. Failing to \nenforce the agreement may harm that person more than it would harm the \nwrongdoer. Courts like to invoke Latin expressions when they’re trying to do \nthe right thing, so in this case, the court may say that the parties are not in \npari delicto,  meaning not “in equal fault.”\n Suppose a state statute regulates life insurance and requires that a life insur -\nance policy include certain statements. An insurance company issues a life \ninsurance policy on John, omitting the required statements. The life insurance \ncompany and John have entered into an agreement that violates the statute. \nSometime later, John dies and Mary, his beneficiary, seeks enforcement of the \npolicy. The insurance company states that because the agreement violated \nthe law, the agreement to insure John is not enforceable.\nBalance the factors for and against enforcement. Even though John is dead, \nyou can still consider his interest as a party to the agreement. He entered the \nagreement with the expectation that Mary would benefit from its purchase. If \nit were not enforced, he would suffer forfeiture, because he would’ve paid the \npremiums in exchange for nothing. And the public would not benefit if enforce -\nment were denied. Although the regulation may be important to enforce as a \nmatter of principle, its enforcement in this case would not harm (and would \nactually benefit) the wrongdoer, the insurance company, but would harm John \nand Mary — the innocent parties. Therefore, in this type of situation, the agree -\nment would be found enforceable even though it’s in violation of the law.\nWhen the crime is not serious\nEnforceability may hinge on the degree of illegality. Obviously, some crimes, \nsuch as drug dealing, are more serious than others, such as operating a busi -\nness without a license. When determining the enforceability of agreements \nthat involve illegality, the degree of illegality is an essential consideration. \nWhen making the determination, the courts consider the following factors:\n ✓ The strength of the policy as reflected in statutes or case law:  How \nmuch interest does society have in enforcement?\n ✓ Whether refusal to enforce the agreement furthers the policy:  Will \nenforcement encourage parties to disobey the law?\n ✓ The seriousness of the misconduct:  Was the misconduct serious  \nenough to challenge enforcement of the contract?\n ✓ The connection between the misconduct and the agreement:  Did the mis -\nconduct go to the heart of the parties’ agreement, or was it just incidental?\n93\nChapter 6: Considering Unenforceability Due to Illegality or Unfairness\n For example, if you hold yourself out as an attorney and enter into agreements \nwith clients without having a license to practice law, any agreement you enter \ninto is illegal, and you’re not allowed to keep any of your fees. That’s because \nin the interest of protecting the public, practicing law without a license is ille -\ngal. On the other hand, suppose in a jurisdiction that licenses contractors, an \nunlicensed contractor renovated a house for $100,000, and then the home -\nowner refused to pay on grounds that the agreement was illegal. The court \nwould likely be torn. Non-enforcement would put teeth in the licensing provi -\nsion, but it would also do the following:\n ✓ Give the homeowner a windfall, because she would keep the improve -\nments for free.\n ✓ Encourage homeowners to hire unlicensed contractors to receive  \nfree renovations.\nA court may therefore decide that protection of the public was a less-important \nfactor in this situation than in the situation of the unlicensed attorney. If the \nprimary purpose of a licensing statute is to raise money, courts usually find \nthat the agreement made by the unlicensed party is enforceable.\n Look for techniques courts use to enforce the agreement (or part of it) that \ndon’t involve a balancing test. Here are two such techniques:\n ✓ Using the concept of divisibility of contract  to enforce the agreement \nin part:  The court separates the parts of the agreement that are illegal \nfrom the parts that are not and then enforces the legal parts. For exam -\nple, in the case of the unlicensed contractor, the court may divide the \nagreement into the services  rendered by the contractor and the supplies  \nused by the contractor. The court could then say that the services por -\ntion was unenforceable but the supplies portion was not.\n ✓ Not enforcing the agreement but allowing restitution: Another tech -\nnique a court may use would be to declare the agreement void, barring \nenforcement under contract law, but then let the contractor recover in \nrestitution the value of the services and supplies. In restitution, even if \nno contract exists, a person may recover the reasonable value of goods \nand services supplied. (See Chapter 4 for info on restitution.)\nWhen the connection to illegality is iffy\n When illegality is involved in an agreement, the balance swings in favor of non-\nenforcement. But if the illegal aspect isn’t closely connected to the agreement, \nthen the balance may swing the other way. It all depends on the facts.\n Suppose a company owns a business on a busy street where parking is illegal \nand subject to a $50 fine. The company orders $10,000 worth of goods for \ndelivery and agrees to reimburse the seller $50 if it has to pay a parking fine. \nThe company obtains the goods and then refuses to pay for them because the \nseller parked illegally when it delivered the goods.",12038
40-Making a Public Policy Argument.pdf,40-Making a Public Policy Argument,"94 Part II: Determining Whether a Contract Is Void, Voidable, or Unenforceable \nMost courts would have no problem enforcing this agreement for the  \nfollowing reasons:\n ✓ A parking violation doesn’t constitute serious misconduct (as you may \nhave discovered when you had to disclose criminal acts in order to \napply to law school!).\n ✓ The misconduct isn’t closely connected to the agreement. This is an \nagreement to buy/sell goods, not to commit a crime.\n ✓ The seller would suffer a serious loss if the buyer were allowed to keep \nthe goods without paying for them.\nIn this case, the factors weigh in favor of enforcing the agreement in spite of \nthe fact that an illegal act was committed during its performance.\nMaking a Public Policy Argument\nMost of the time, no law tells the parties ahead of time (called a priori  in \nLatin) that they can’t make a certain agreement. Nevertheless, one of the par -\nties may ask the court to declare after the fact (called ex post  in Latin) that \ntheir agreement isn’t enforceable based on public policy,  the need to protect \nsome aspect of the public welfare. In such a case, the agreement is presump -\ntively (assumed to be) valid but is subject to a defense that vitiates (nullifies) \nit, making it a voidable  contract. If the court agrees with the party, the court \noften justifies its decision to avoid the contract by stating that the agreement \n“violates public policy.”\n Unfortunately, courts rarely explain what “violating public policy” means. What \nthey usually mean is that some other public policy carries more weight in this \nparticular case than the public policy of freedom of contract. Courts often \ninvoke public policy when the contract meets any of the following criteria:\n ✓ It restrains trade.\n ✓ It interferes with family relationships.\n ✓ It encourages torts (wrongful acts for which victims may claim damages).\nThis section explains how to evaluate enforceability based on public policy \nand, in the process, formulate a more articulate public policy argument.\n95\nChapter 6: Considering Unenforceability Due to Illegality or Unfairness\nExamining enforceability in agreements \nthat restrain trade\nAn agreement with the sole purpose of restraining trade is illegal under anti -\ntrust laws. When an agreement’s purpose is not exclusively to restrain trade, \nhowever, the courts must consider several factors to determine whether a \nterm in the agreement is enforceable:\n ✓ The interests of the party who requested the term\n ✓ The reasonableness of the trade restraint\n ✓ The hardship of the party who agreed to it\n ✓ The public interest\nA good example of such a term is a restrictive covenant  — a term in an employ -\nment contract that forbids the employee from accepting certain employment \nopportunities after employment is terminated for whatever reason.\n For example, the contract of an employee of a software company in Silicon \nValley provides that when her employment terminates, she agrees not to work \nfor another software company in Silicon Valley or in the State of Washington \nfor a certain period of time. This term restrains the employee from practicing \nher trade, but because it’s only one term in an otherwise reasonable employ -\nment contract, the entire purpose of the contract is not the restraint of trade.\n In deciding whether to enforce a restrictive covenant, a court weighs both \nsides. On one hand, people should be able to work for whomever they please. \nOn the other hand, the employer has an interest in protecting its trade secrets \nand competitive advantage. Most courts balance these interests by consider -\ning the extent of the restriction in respect toRiding the unruly horse of public policy\nIn a very old case, an English judge wrote that \n“public policy is a very unruly horse, and once \nyou get astride it you never know where it will \ncarry you.” All too often, “public policy” is a \nconclusion rather than a reasoned argument, \nso determining exactly why the court objected \nto the agreement may be very difficult.An old lawyer’s joke offers some sage advice: \n“If the facts are in your favor, argue the facts. If \nthe law is in your favor, argue the law. If neither \nis in your favor, argue public policy.”\n96 Part II: Determining Whether a Contract Is Void, Voidable, or Unenforceable \n ✓ The scope of employment:  What kind of employment does it restrict?\n ✓ The geographical area:  Does the restriction prevent the employee from \nfinding other work anywhere or only where that employment is likely to \ninterfere with the employer?\n ✓ The time:  Does the restriction last only a reasonable period of time?\nIf the court concludes that these factors favor the employee’s arguments \nagainst enforcement, it will not enforce the term. It then faces the further ques -\ntion of which remedy to employ. Courts may strike the offending term entirely, \nrewrite it to make it more reasonable, or revise it by using the blue pencil test  \nto strike certain words. For example, from the term “not work for another soft -\nware company in Silicon Valley or in the State of Washington,” a court may use \nthe blue pencil to strike the words “or in the State of Washington,” limiting the \ngeographical area of the restrictive covenant to Silicon Valley.\nExamining enforceability in agreements \nthat interfere with family relationships\nThe area of family relationships is one in which courts often use the doctrine \nof public policy to discourage undesirable conduct. In such cases, the court \ntries to balance freedom of contract against other policies.\n A good example is the case of In the Matter of Baby M,  which arose in the mid-\n1980s, when assisted reproduction techniques were still a novelty. A married \ncouple, William and Elizabeth Stern, was unable to have children because of \nElizabeth’s medical condition. With the help of an attorney who specialized in \nsuch matters, they entered into an agreement with a woman named Mary Beth \nWhitehead. The agreement provided that Whitehead would be a surrogate \nmother, bearing William’s baby by artificial insemination and then giving it to \nthe Sterns in a private adoption. After she gave the child, known as Baby M, to \nthe Sterns, Whitehead had a change of heart and wanted to get her back. The \nSterns sued to enforce the agreement.\nThe trial court thought that this was a matter of freedom of contract and \nenforced the agreement, but the Supreme Court of New Jersey vigorously \ndisagreed. The court found that it was a case of illegal baby-selling and added \nthat even if it weren’t, it wasn’t the kind of agreement the court thought people \nshould be making. It declared the agreement to be against public policy and \nunenforceable, saying, “[H]er consent is irrelevant. There are, in a civilized \nsociety, some things that money cannot buy.”\n97\nChapter 6: Considering Unenforceability Due to Illegality or Unfairness\nExamining enforceability in agreements \nthat encourage torts\nA tort is a civil wrong, such as negligence, for which victims may claim damages. \nThe obligations people have to not commit torts arise from the law, but their \nobligations in contract arise only from their voluntary agreements. Contract law \nand tort law intersect when the agreement contains an exculpatory clause  stating \nthat one party agrees not to hold the other party liable for negligent acts he com -\nmits after they make the agreement. The word exculpatory  comes from the Latin \nex, meaning “not,” and culpa,  meaning “guilt.” If a person is exculpated from his \nacts of negligence, then he’s not guilty of committing a tort.\nExculpatory clauses used to be common in residential leases, but you can \neasily imagine why courts were concerned about them. Suppose a tenant \nagrees not to hold the landlord liable for negligent acts, such as failing to \nrepair common areas. If the tenant trips and falls, injuring herself, the land -\nlord could say, “Ha-ha! You don’t have any tort claim against me because you \nagreed to an exculpatory clause.”\nEvaluating exculpatory clauses\nCourts have struggled with the question of whether to enforce exculpatory \nclauses. They want to uphold freedom of contract, but they also want to dis -\ncourage acts of negligence.\n To make a strong public policy argument, begin by asking, “Exactly which \naspects of an exculpatory clause make it offensive and therefore contrary to \npublic policy?” Here’s a list of common concerns about exculpatory clauses:\n ✓ How broad is it?  Does it exculpate the party not only from acts of \nsimple negligence but also from more-serious acts like intentional torts? \nOf course, a party can draft the clause narrowly to address this concern.\n ✓ Does it give adequate notice?  If the clause is found in fine print, the \nother party may not have known it was in the contract. To address this \nconcern, the exculpatory clause can be presented in bold print on the \nfront page of the contract or on its own page to be signed separately.\n ✓ Did the other party lack bargaining power?  If housing is scarce, for exam -\nple, tenants may agree to almost anything to obtain housing. A landlord can \ndo little to address such a concern, but courts would have to decide on a \ncase-by-case basis whether the tenant had any bargaining power.\n ✓ What are the economics of the situation?  Who should bear the risk of \nloss? Who has the most control over avoiding the cost of injury? In the \ncase of a tenant-landlord contract, making the landlords responsible for \nthis loss would give them an incentive to keep the premises repaired. \nMoreover, they could obtain insurance to cover any claims and could \npass the cost of the insurance to their tenants through the rent.",9812
41-Testing an Agreement against the Doctrine of Unconscionability.pdf,41-Testing an Agreement against the Doctrine of Unconscionability,"98 Part II: Determining Whether a Contract Is Void, Voidable, or Unenforceable \nDetermining the present state of the law regarding exculpatory clauses\nA number of state legislatures have enacted statutes that make exculpatory \nclauses in residential leases illegal before the fact — that is, they make it ille -\ngal to include the term in an agreement. In other states, the courts have ruled \nthat the terms are unenforceable after the fact. In such a jurisdiction, lawyers \nface an ethical dilemma when deciding whether to include an exculpatory \nclause in a lease. On the one hand, drafting it in the agreement isn’t illegal. \nOn the other hand, the other party probably doesn’t know it’s likely to be \nunenforceable and may be misled by its presence in the agreement.\nThe question of the enforceability of exculpatory clauses in transactions \nother than residential leases is very much up in the air. You can safely say \nthat the answer is “It depends on the jurisdiction!” Most courts have found \ntransactions that don’t involve much public interest, such as commercial \nleases, to be an appropriate area for freedom of contract, leaving it to the \nparties to allocate the risk. But in transactions that do involve public interest, \nwhere a member of the public has little opportunity to bargain, most courts \nhave refused to enforce exculpatory clauses. Examples include exculpatory \nclauses in agreements for public conveyance and for hospital services.\n Not knowing whether a term is going to be enforced isn’t desirable in contract \nlaw. Knowing the rules of the game ahead of time improves efficiency in plan -\nning transactions and makes it easier for everyone to stay out of court.\nTesting an Agreement against the \nDoctrine of Unconscionability\nEveryone agrees that courts have the power to determine that an agreement \nor a term in an agreement is unconscionable  and refuse to enforce it even \nif the agreement or the term isn’t illegal. What they don’t agree on is when \ncourts should use that power.\nPart of the problem is that unconscionable  is a vague word. For example, \nUCC § 2-302 gives courts this power, but it doesn’t define unconscionability.  \nThe Official Comment states that “the basic test is whether [. . .] the clauses \ninvolved are so one-sided as to be unconscionable.” Thanks a lot! The Code’s \nfailure to define the term is no doubt intentional, because to define is to limit, \nand the law wants the concept to be flexible.\n Think of unconscionable  as meaning that the agreement or the term shocks the \nconscience of the court. But one person’s meat is another’s poison, so don’t \nexpect consensus on which terms are shocking enough to be unconscionable.\n99\nChapter 6: Considering Unenforceability Due to Illegality or Unfairness\nApplying the doctrine of unconscionability \nin the UCC\nA party may ask the court to strike not an entire agreement but just the offen -\nsive term as unconscionable. This power is given to courts in cases involving \nthe sale of goods by UCC § 2-302, which provides the following in subsection \n(1) as enacted in North Carolina:\n§ 25-2-302. Unconscionable contract or clause.\n(1) If the court as a matter of law finds the contract or any clause of the \ncontract to have been unconscionable at the time it was made the court \nmay refuse to enforce the contract, or it may enforce the remainder of the \ncontract without the unconscionable clause, or it may so limit the applica -\ntion of any unconscionable clause as to avoid any unconscionable result.\n Note how flexible the unconscionable-contract-or-clause statute is. It starts \nwith the words “If the court as a matter of law  finds.” Judges decide matters of \nlaw, and juries decide matters of fact. Because this statute says that the court \nhas to find unconscionability as a matter of law, the determination of uncon -\nscionability is up to the judge, not the jury. The courts wouldn’t want juries \nto get carried away by sympathy for the plaintiff! The judge has the power to \ndetermine whether the agreement or a term of the agreement is unconscio -\nnable. Having found it unconscionable, the judge is then free to fashion an \nappropriate remedy. The judge may throw out just the term, throw out the \nentire agreement, or limit the application of the term.\n The classic example of application of the concept of unconscionability is the \ncase of  Williams v. Walker-Thomas Furniture Co.  Williams, a mother on welfare, \npurchased a number of goods from the defendant’s store on credit. Each time \nshe did so, she signed a new agreement. After a number of years, when she was \nunable to make a payment on a record player, the store demanded that she \nreturn everything she had ever purchased from the store on credit. It turned \nout that a clause buried in the agreement, called a cross-collateralization clause,  \nstated (in a lot more words than this) that if she defaulted on one agreement, \nthe store could take back not just the item she bought under that agreement \nbut everything she had ever purchased from them on credit. With the help of \nLegal Aid, she sued to have the clause stricken from the agreement.\nThe trial court judge condemned the practice of the store but found that he \nlacked the power to do anything about it because the jurisdiction had not \nenacted the UCC at the time the agreements were entered into. The appellate \ncourt reversed, holding that it didn’t matter that the UCC had not been enacted, \nbecause the doctrine of unconscionability was found in the common law. \nTherefore, judges can decide that a term is unconscionable even if no statute \nauthorizes them to do so. Although that was the holding of the case, the judge \nin dicta  (language of a court opinion addressing an issue that did not need to be \nresolved to decide the case) indicated how courts could analyze an agreement \n100 Part II: Determining Whether a Contract Is Void, Voidable, or Unenforceable \nto determine whether unconscionability was present. The next section explains \nhow to make that analysis.\nDistinguishing procedural and  \nsubstantive unconscionability\n For a term or contract to be found unconscionable, it must pass a two-part \ntest to meet the conditions of procedural unconscionability and substantive \nunconscionability:\n ✓ Procedural unconscionability:  This point concerns the procedure by \nwhich the parties entered into the contract. Did one of the parties have \nan absence of meaningful choice?\n ✓ Substantive unconscionability:  This point concerns the fairness of the \ncontract or term being contested. Is the contract or any term it contains \nunreasonably favorable to one of the parties?\nThis section helps you examine these two conditions of unconscionability \nand develop a clearer understanding of them.\nExamining procedural unconscionability: Take-it-or-leave-it deals\nProcedural unconscionability occurs most commonly in a contract of adhe -\nsion.  With a contract of adhesion, the parties don’t engage in back-and-forth \nnegotiation and then give their final assent to the terms they’ve both agreed \nto. One party dictates the terms, and the other party either accepts or walks \naway. Contracts of adhesion account for a huge majority of all contracts, \nincluding those for leasing an apartment, taking out a student loan, or pur -\nchasing just about anything online.\n Although negotiation is absent in most contracts of adhesion, they’re still \nenforceable because the parties give their assent to be bound. Under the \ndoctrine of objective manifestation of intent,  you’re bound by a contract even \nif you didn’t read it or understand it (see Chapter 2). Nevertheless, courts \noften scrutinize a contract of adhesion more closely because of the procedure \nby which it was formed. Therefore, when analyzing a transaction, always ask \nwhether it involves a contract of adhesion.\nProcedural unconscionability may occur in other types of contracts as  \nwell. Situations in which courts find procedural unconscionability include  \nthe following:\n ✓ One party pressured the other to sign without providing any opportu -\nnity to read the contract.\n ✓ The contract is unreadable because it’s full of complex language or \nterms written in fine print.\n101\nChapter 6: Considering Unenforceability Due to Illegality or Unfairness\nHowever, procedural unconscionability isn’t sufficient grounds for finding a \nterm or a contract unconscionable. The contract or term must satisfy both \nparts of the two-part test. It must show evidence of substantive unconsciona -\nbility, too, as I explain next.\nExamining substantive unconscionability: Unfair terms\nCourts tend to scrutinize contracts of adhesion closely because courts are con -\ncerned that the party who prepares the contract, knowing that the other party \nmust sign it as written, may be tempted to slip in some very harsh terms. After all, \nif negotiation is not an option and the other party probably won’t even read the \ncontract, the drafter has plenty of motivation and little deterrent in setting terms.\nThis is where substantive unconscionability — the second condition neces -\nsary to find a contract or any of its terms unconscionable — comes into play. \nBut what does it mean that a term is substantively unfair, and how do you \nprove it to a court? The plaintiff may allege that the term\n ✓ Was unfairly oppressive\n ✓ Took the plaintiff by surprise\n ✓ Allocated most of the risks to the plaintiff\n In Williams v. Walker-Thomas Furniture Co.,  for example, the plaintiff’s claim was \nthat the cross-collateralization clause was overly protective of the seller’s inter -\nests and caused out-of-proportion harm to the buyer. (See the earlier section \n“Applying the doctrine of unconscionability in the UCC” for details on this case.)\nHowever, the party who drafted the contract has the opportunity to chal -\nlenge that allegation. Subsection (2) of UCC § 2-302 says that the party who \nslipped the unfair term into the contract should be given an opportunity \nto prove that in its commercial context, the term wasn’t so bad after all. As \nenacted in North Carolina, § 25-2-302(2) provides:\nSeeing the economist’s perspective  \non unconscionability\nOur economist friends, such as Judge Richard \nPosner of the United States Court of Appeals for \nthe 7th Circuit, look skeptically at the doctrine \nof unconscionability. They think that a person \nalways has the choice not to enter a contract. \nIf a contract contains outrageous terms, people \ncan refuse to sign it, and the market may coun -\nter with someone who offers better terms. An economist may argue that if the court denies a \nfurniture store its cross-collateralization clause \n(which allows the store to repossess all items \na customer ever purchased from it on credit if \nthe buyer defaults on one agreement), the store \neither must raise its prices or go out of busi -\nness, neither of which is a helpful outcome for \nthe furniture buyer.",11068
42-Challenging Enforceability with the Doctrine of Reasonable Expectations.pdf,42-Challenging Enforceability with the Doctrine of Reasonable Expectations,"102 Part II: Determining Whether a Contract Is Void, Voidable, or Unenforceable \n(2) When it is claimed or appears to the court that the contract or any \nclause thereof may be unconscionable the parties shall be afforded a \nreasonable opportunity to present evidence as to its commercial setting, \npurpose and effect to aid the court in making the determination.\nIn other words, even if a contract or clause looks shocking at first glance, \nthe drafter has the opportunity to explain why it makes sense in its context, \nwhich often involves the economics of the situation.\n To qualify as unconscionable, a term must pass the two-part test, so the fact \nthat a term is unfair is not sufficient. The procedure must be unfair as well. If \nthe parties negotiated, they had the opportunity to protect themselves from \nunfair terms. If a party agreed to an unfair term, she probably got something \nshe wanted in return.\n If I buy for $1,000 a TV that regularly sells for $700, the deal may seem sub -\nstantively unfair, but because the price term was obvious and I knew exactly \nwhat I was getting into, the term appears to be free of procedural unconscio -\nnability. This is why courts rarely find unconscionability when the only issue \nis the price.\n The concept of unconscionability is most common when a consumer enters a \ncontract with a business for personal, family, or household purposes, because \nconsumer transactions usually involve an unsophisticated party who lacks \nbargaining power. It’s less common in contracts between two commercial par -\nties. Exceptions exist, but they usually arise when a commercial party, like a \nconsumer, has no bargaining power, as in the case of a franchise agreement — \na contract to license the sale of a trademarked product, like a brand of burger \nor taco. Even though this commercial contract may involve a lot of money and \nsophisticated parties, it may still be a contract of adhesion that a court is will -\ning to scrutinize. In fact, some jurisdictions have enacted statutes to regulate \nthis type of contract.\nChallenging Enforceability with the \nDoctrine of Reasonable Expectations\nOne doctrine that courts increasingly use to police contracts is the doctrine \nof reasonable expectations.  The defense is that the offending term may not be \nso bad as to be unconscionable, but a reasonable person probably wouldn’t \nhave agreed to it if he or she had known it was in the contract. The doctrine \nof reasonable expectations is based on three assumptions:\n103\nChapter 6: Considering Unenforceability Due to Illegality or Unfairness\n ✓ Parties don’t read contracts of adhesion.\n ✓ Parties assume that they know the essential terms of the transaction.\n ✓ Parties can’t negotiate the terms even if they do read and understand them.\nTherefore, the drafter has a duty to call unusual terms to the attention of the \nother party.\n For example, some car rental companies in California were hitting drivers \nwith a substantial additional charge when they took the car to Las Vegas. A \nnumber of drivers were abandoning the cars in Las Vegas, and the charge was \nintended to discourage that practice. Therefore, the company may have had a \nreasonable commercial reason for putting the term in the contract. The prob -\nlem was that customers were taken by surprise and didn’t know the term was \nin the contract until after they had violated it.\nThe car rental agency may maintain that under the doctrine of objective \nmanifestation of assent, renters are responsible for the terms of the contract \nwhether they read them or not. On the other hand, that’s not realistic for the \nthree reasons I mention previously:\n ✓ Renters don’t read their contracts.\n ✓ Renters think that they know what terms the contract contains.\n ✓ Renters can’t negotiate the terms anyway.\n The solution for the drafter who wants to make an unusual term enforceable \nis to call it to the attention of the other party. They can do this by making it \nconspicuous — calling it to your attention by putting it in bold print at the \ntop of the contract or having you separately sign that term. This is why when \nyou enter into a contract of adhesion to buy something online, instead of just \nchecking that you’ve read the terms and conditions, sometimes the seller \ncalls a few of the terms to your attention to be individually acknowledged. The \ncompany is probably trying to comply with the doctrine of reasonable expec -\ntations to prevent you from claiming you didn’t know that those terms were \nincluded in the contract.\n104 Part II: Determining Whether a Contract Is Void, Voidable, or Unenforceable",4676

44-Recognizing Who Can Legally Make a Contract.pdf,44-Recognizing Who Can Legally Make a Contract,"Chapter 7\nEvaluating the Parties’ Ability  \nto Make the Contract\nIn This Chapter\n▶ Determining whether a party was capable of making a contract\n▶ Checking whether a party was tricked or coerced into making a contract\n▶ Challenging a contract formed by mutual or unilateral mistake\nI \nn forming a contract, parties express themselves as autonomous individuals, \nfreely committing to bargains that may have serious consequences. Contract \nlaw wants to be sure that the parties know what they’re doing when they under -\ntake this important task, and it provides a defense if a person doesn’t act in his \nown best interests because he’s unable to, the other party does something to \ncoerce or mislead him, or one or both parties make a mistake.\nThis chapter reveals how contract law makes these determinations so you’re \nbetter able to evaluate contracts in disputes that involve your clients.\nRecognizing Who Can Legally  \nMake a Contract\nAlthough the United States Constitution doesn’t expressly mention the free -\ndom to make contracts, it’s an important individual freedom that contract \nlaw wants to protect. However, contract law must also protect individuals \nwho lack the capacity to act in their own best interests from entering into \nagreements that take unfair advantage of them. You can call this protection \nfreedom from  contract. It protects individuals who\n106 Part II: Determining Whether a Contract Is Void, Voidable, or Unenforceable \n ✓ Have a mental incapacity due to\n  • Mental illness or other brain disorders\n  • Being under the influence of alcohol or other substances that may \nnegatively affect judgment\n ✓ Are minors (under the age of 18)\nThis section explains each of these conditions in detail.\nPassing the mental capacity check\nContract law presumes that each party has the mental capacity to make a \ncontract. This capacity is a given unless an adjudication of incompetency pro-\nceeding determines that the person is incompetent. After a person is ruled \nlegally incompetent, she’s incapable of entering into contracts as a matter of \nlaw, and any contracts she makes are void from the beginning.\nAn incompetency ruling can prevent problems for the person’s family; for \nexample, it can prevent an individual from improvidently contracting away \nthe family’s assets. On the other hand, because taking freedom of contract \naway is so serious, the court doesn’t do it lightly.\nLacking mental capacity as a matter of fact\nIf a person hasn’t been ruled incompetent, she may still be considered legally \nincompetent as a matter of fact  at the time she entered into the contract. In \nother words, even though no formal legal proceeding determined incompe -\ntence before the person entered into the contract, evidence that the person \nwas incompetent at the time she entered the contract can be shown after \nthe fact. If the proof is successful, then the presumptively valid contract is \navoided  (declared to be of no legal effect).\nTo determine incompetence as a matter of fact, the courts rely on one of the \nfollowing types of tests:\n ✓ Cognitive:  Traditionally, courts have used a cognitive test  to determine \nwhether the person understood the nature and consequences of the trans -\naction at the time. A reasonable person should be able to tell from some -\none’s outward manifestations whether she has sufficient understanding.\n ✓ Motivational:  A number of courts have adopted a motivational test  that \ngoes beyond determining whether a person understands the situation. \nThis test also looks at\n  • Whether mental illness renders the person unable to act in   \naccordance with that understanding, and\n  • Whether the other party knows or has reason to know of the   \nother’s lack of capacity\n107  Chapter 7: Evaluating the Parties’ Ability to Make the Contract\n For example, in the case of Ortelere v. Teachers’ Retirement Board,  Mrs. Ortelere  \nhad suffered a “nervous breakdown” that a psychiatrist diagnosed as involun -\ntary psychosis. She also suffered from cerebral arteriosclerosis. Her teacher’s \nretirement plan provided that she would receive $375 per month, and if she \ndied, the remainder of her account would go to her husband. Later, she entered \ninto a contract to change that benefit to a plan in which she would receive $450 \nper month, and if she died, nothing would go to her husband, who had quit \nwork to care for her. Two months later, she died. Her husband sued on her \nbehalf, asking the court to determine that because she was mentally incompe -\ntent at the time she entered the transaction, the contract should be avoided.\nThe problem for the court was to determine which test to use to deter -\nmine mental incompetence. The trial court had used the cognitive test. \nUnfortunately for Mr. Ortelere, Mrs. Ortelere showed a great deal of cogni -\ntive understanding — she had written a letter to the Board clearly indicating \nthat she understood the consequences of her choice — and the court had \nfound her competent. Mr. Ortelere’s attorney persuaded the appellate court \nto allow a new trial in which the trial court would use the motivational test, \nallowing the contract to be avoided even if she understood it, as long as the \nfact that she couldn’t act in accordance with that understanding was proven.\nThe dissent went ballistic, making the point that the policy of the law was to \nprevent people from taking advantage of someone deemed incompetent. The \nstrength of the cognitive test was that a reasonable person ought to be able to \nsee whether the person claiming incompetence understood the transaction, and \nif the person did, the contract was binding. But under the motivational test, a  \nperson apparently demonstrating full understanding could come back and say, \n“Let me out of the contract because I couldn’t act in accordance with that under -\nstanding!” According to the dissenters, this would upset the sanctity of contract.\nThe majority backed off a bit, saying that the court would apply the new test \nto avoid the contract of the incompetent party only when\n ✓ The other party knew of the mental illness.\n ✓ The mental illness was serious.\n ✓ The other party didn’t rely on the contract (see Chapter 4 for details  \non reliance).\nIn Mrs. Ortelere’s case, her mental illness was in the records of the Teachers’ \nRetirement Board, it was a serious mental illness, and the retirement fund \nhad many contributors, so the fund was not seriously impacted by a change \non the part of one individual. Therefore, it was an appropriate case for appli -\ncation of the motivational test.\nMaking contracts under the influence of drugs or alcohol\nThe principle that applies to mental incompetence (see the preceding sec -\ntion) applies when a person is under the influence of drugs or alcohol, \n108 Part II: Determining Whether a Contract Is Void, Voidable, or Unenforceable \nbecause that individual probably lacks the ability to understand the nature \nand consequences of the transaction. The court expects the other party not \nto make contracts with individuals who exhibit signs of so much intoxication \nthat they don’t understand the transaction.\nIf the other party does make a contract, it is voidable by the intoxicated \nperson. For example, if Britney goes to Las Vegas, gets drunk, and gets mar -\nried on impulse, she can avoid the marriage contract after she sobers up and \nrealizes what she did.\n In Lucy v. Zehmer,  a farmer sold his farm at a Christmas party at which alcohol \nwas flowing. Although he claimed he was “high as a Georgia pine,” the court \nfound from the evidence that he wasn’t so drunk that he couldn’t understand the \nnature and consequences of the contract. He was stuck with the deal he made.\nEnforcing the obligation of the incompetent through restitution\nBecause people who lack capacity as a matter of law can’t make valid con -\ntracts, and people who lack capacity as a matter of fact can make only void -\nable contracts, businesses might understandably be reluctant to contract \nwith them. It could produce undesirable results. A hotel clerk, for example, \nmight deny a room to a person who’s had too much to drink, because the \nclerk may fear a court would later determine the person was incompetent \nand therefore would not be obligated to pay anything for the room.\nIf someone lacks the mental capacity to enter into an enforceable contract, that \nperson may still be liable for necessities such as food, shelter, and clothing \nunder the doctrine of  restitution  (see Chapter 4). Restitution protects both parties:\n ✓ Provider:  The person providing the benefit is due compensation for the \nvalue of that benefit. Even if the contract isn’t enforceable, the person \nwho provided a necessity should get restitution for the reasonable value \nof the benefit.\n ✓ Recipient:  The person who received the benefit is obligated to compensate \nthe provider only for the value of the benefit and not necessarily for the \namount agreed upon at contract formation. For example, if a hotel clerk \ntakes advantage of a patron who’s drunk by selling a $100-a-night room for \n$1,000, the patron could claim that the contract to pay $1,000 was voidable, \nbut he’d be liable in restitution for the reasonable value of $100.\nChild’s play? Making contracts with minors\nA minor,  sometimes referred to in cases as an infant,  is anyone under the age \nof 18 years. A minor is capable of entering into only voidable contracts  —  \ncontracts the minor can choose to get out of.\n109  Chapter 7: Evaluating the Parties’ Ability to Make the Contract\n  Don’t consider contracts with minors void or unenforceable. Voidable con -\ntracts are presumed to be valid. A contract is ineffective only if the minor affir -\nmatively and timely avoids it. The following rules apply to most contract cases \ninvolving a minor:\n ✓ The minor can avoid the contract at any time before he turns 18 or \nwithin a reasonable time thereafter.\n ✓ The minor can affirm  (decide to stay in) the contract only after he turns 18.\n Only the minor has the power to avoid the contract. If a person over the age of \n18 enters into a contract with a minor, that person can’t seek to avoid it on the \ngrounds of the other party’s being a minor.\nAlthough all the states agree that minors may avoid their contracts, states \ndisagree on many issues that arise in connection with the minor’s avoiding \nthe contract, such as the following considerations:\n ✓ When a minor is considered emancipated  (able to enter contracts \nin spite of being under the age of 18):  A state may consider minors \nemancipated if they’re married or in business. In some states, however, \na minor must go through an emancipation proceeding. You may have \nheard of entertainers and athletes, including actress Drew Barrymore \nand gymnast Dominique Moceanu, doing this.\n ✓ What minors must give back if they avoid a contract:  In many jurisdic -\ntions, minors must give back only what remains of the consideration \nthey received, regardless of any decline in the value of the consider -\nation. That is, if the minor avoids a contract, he doesn’t have to make \nrestitution. If a minor buys a car and totals it, in most jurisdictions, the \nminor need only return the totaled car to get his money back.\n ✓ Which exceptions bind the minor to the contract:  Many states create \nexceptions in some situations and require the minor to return the \nvalue received. These exceptions include situations in which the minor \nconvincingly misrepresented his age or paid in cash instead of buying \non credit. And — sorry, folks — most states have statutes stating that \nminors can’t avoid contracts for student loans.\n  Restitution also applies when the minor buys necessities, such as food, \nshelter, and clothing. The policy behind the general rule clearly tells \npeople that they deal with minors at their own risk, but they shouldn’t \nhave to take a risk if they’re providing necessities.",12072
45-Basing a Contract Defense on One Partys Bad Actions.pdf,45-Basing a Contract Defense on One Partys Bad Actions,"110 Part II: Determining Whether a Contract Is Void, Voidable, or Unenforceable \nBasing a Contract Defense  \non One Party’s Bad Actions\nEven if both parties are capable of making a contract based on age and \ncompetence, Party A could do something to coerce or mislead Party B into \nmaking a contract that doesn’t serve Party B’s best interests. To discourage \nthis kind of behavior and enable victims to escape such agreements, contract \nlaw provides for defenses based on fraud, duress, and undue influence, as I \nexplain in this section.\nSaying things that aren’t  \ntrue: The fraud defense\nThe fraud defense  arises when one party is misled to a point at which she \ncan’t appreciate the actual consequences of entering into the contract. \nMisleading actions or deeds may result in one of the following types of fraud:\n ✓ Fraud in the factum (making [of the contract]):  This type of fraud \ninvolves misleading a person to the point at which he doesn’t even \nrealize he’s entering into a contract. In these cases, the parties haven’t \nformed a contract. For example, suppose I hand you a piece of paper \nthat’s folded over to reveal only a space for a signature. I say, “This is \nmy new will. I would like you to sign it.” You sign it, and then I say,  \n“Ha-ha! You just signed a contract to sell me your house for $100,000.”\n ✓ Fraud in the inducement:  Fraud in the inducement involves making a \nfalse representation to get a person to enter into a contract. In this case, \nboth parties are well aware that they’re entering into a contract, but one \nparty provides misleading information to the other concerning an impor -\ntant term of the agreement. For example, assume that you and I are nego -\ntiating the sale of my house. Knowing my house has termites, I say, “This \nhouse has no termites.” I’ve just committed fraud in the inducement. If \nyou later discover that the statement is false, you can avoid the contract.\nProving fraud in the inducement may be quite a challenge because the plain -\ntiff (the party claiming fraud) must prove that the other party (the defendant) \nmade a misrepresentation of fact, that the defendant knew it was false, that \nit was material, and that the plaintiff reasonably relied on it. This section \nexplains these issues in greater depth and explores the victim’s option of \nseeking a claim in contract or in tort.\nRecognizing misrepresentations that constitute fraud\nTo constitute fraud, a misrepresentation must be of fact  — something that \ncan be verified or disproven.\n111  Chapter 7: Evaluating the Parties’ Ability to Make the Contract\n To determine whether a misrepresentation is one of fact, ask whether an \nobjective standard is available for measuring its truth or falseness. For exam -\nple, if I claim that the car I’m selling is rust-free, and the floor is rusted out, the \nrust is objective proof that my assertion is false.\nNon-fact misrepresentations may be opinions or puffing. If in the course of \nselling you my car, I say things like “you won’t get a better deal in all of the \ntown” or “this baby runs like a dream,” those are probably not the kind of \nstatements that give rise to fraud, because someone would have a tough  \ntime digging up evidence to disprove them.\nOne of the most difficult problems in fraud is deciding when a failure to disclose \na fact is the equivalent of making an affirmative misrepresentation (coming \nright out and saying it). When disclosure is required, the two are equivalent, \nbut deciding what the parties must disclose is a moving target. To determine \nwhether the law requires disclosure, consider factors such as the following:\n ✓ The jurisdiction:  Check the statutes and case law for the jurisdiction \nthat governs the terms of the contract to determine what each party \nmust disclose in a certain type of transaction.\n ✓ The nature of the item for sale:  Different rules may govern the sale of \ndifferent items such as a house, car, appliance, or collectible.\n ✓ Whether the party is the buyer or the seller:  Different rules may apply \nto the buyer and seller.\n For example, in most jurisdictions, the seller of residential real estate must \ndisclose to the buyer any material problem that is latent  (hidden from view). \nOn the other hand, if the buyer knows that the property is or soon will be \nworth a lot more than the seller thinks it is, the buyer is not required to \ndivulge this nugget of information. Sellers of used cars usually don’t have to \ndisclose defects even if they’re aware of the problems. In recent years, many \njurisdictions have enacted statutes addressing whether sellers of homes must \ndisclose murders or deaths from AIDS on the premises.\nActs such as concealment and telling a half-truth to prevent the discovery of \na problem also may be the equivalent of making an affirmative misrepresen -\ntation. If I cover up the termite holes in my house to prevent you from seeing \nthem, that’s fraud. If you ask me about termites and I say, “We used to have \nthem” but don’t tell you that we still do, that’s fraud, too.\nRelying on the misrepresentation: What does the contract say?\nThe defrauded party has to prove that he relied on the fraud. Proving reli -\nance can be a problem when the contract shifts responsibility from one party \nto the other by stating that one party did not rely on any statements or is \nsolely responsible for obtaining that information.\n112 Part II: Determining Whether a Contract Is Void, Voidable, or Unenforceable \n For example, a buyer claims that after he purchased a property, he discovered \nthat the basement contained water damage that the seller had failed to dis -\nclose. The seller says that the damage was  not latent  (that it was plainly visi -\nble) and the buyer should’ve seen it when inspecting the basement. The buyer \nsays that he didn’t inspect the basement because the seller told him there was \nnothing to see down there. As if that weren’t problem enough, the contract \ncontains a provision that says\nThe buyer has fully inspected the premises and is satisfied with their \ncondition. No statements about the condition of the premises have been \nmade to the buyer other that what is contained in this agreement. The \nbuyer accepts the premises as is in their present condition.\nUnder such circumstances, proving that the buyer relied on any statement \nwould be tough. However, if the seller has a duty to disclose, none of this  \nevidence that appears to work against the buyer matters. The seller \nshould’ve disclosed the damage.\nFurthermore, some courts may say that if one party fraudulently induced the \nother to enter into the contract, then what the contract says doesn’t matter \nbecause a fraudulent act voided the contract.\n  When you’re writing a contract, if your client is relying on a certain represen -\ntation or promise by the other party, include that representation or promise \nin the contract so your client has an easier time of proving reliance or breach \nif a dispute arises.\nChoosing a remedy: Contract fraud or tort fraud\nIf the victim of fraud can prove that the other party intentionally misled her, \nshe can decide which remedy she wants to pursue:\n ✓ Contract fraud:  Avoid the contract and be put back in the pre-  \ncontract position.\n ✓ Tort fraud:  Affirm the contract (stay in it) and make a claim to  \nrecover damages, which may include punitive damages that aren’t \nallowed in contract law.\nThe tort option is available only if the misrepresentation is intentional. If the \nparty making a statement doesn’t know it’s false, then you have an innocent \nmisrepresentation, not fraud. If, not knowing the house has termites, I say, \n“This house has no termites,” I haven’t intentionally misled you, so a tort \nremedy is not an option. However, you’re just as misled as if I did know, so in \nmost jurisdictions you can still avoid the contract on grounds called construc -\ntive fraud  — fraud lacking the intent to deceive.\n In contract planning, think ahead to which remedy your client wants in the \nevent that fraud occurs. Will she want out of the contract, or will she want to  \n113  Chapter 7: Evaluating the Parties’ Ability to Make the Contract\nkeep the contract and pursue damages? Include language in the contract that \nenables your client to pursue that remedy.\n  Suppose Business A is buying Business B, and Business B has stated that  \nit has assets worth $300,000. Business A must decide whether, if that state -\nment is not true, it wants damages for breach of contract to get what it was \npromised or whether it wants to get out of the contract. If the contract says, \n“Business B  warrants  that it has assets worth $300,000,” then Business A can  \nget damages if the warranty is not true. If the contract says, “Business B  rep-\nresents that it has assets worth $300,000,” then Business A can avoid the con -\ntract if the representation is not true. Many drafters use the phrase “warrants  \nand represents” to preserve a choice of remedies.\nMaking an offer they can’t  \nrefuse: The duress defense\nIn contract law, duress  occurs when one party makes an unlawful threat to \nthe other party that gives the person no reasonable alternative but to enter \ninto the contract. In duress, the victim acts against his own will and enters \ninto the contract involuntarily. To qualify for a duress defense, the plaintiff \nmust prove the following:\n ✓ One party threatened the other with a serious and unlawful threat, such \nas bodily harm, death, or financial hardship.\n ✓ The threatened party had no reasonable alternative but to accept the \nterms being offered.\n ✓ The threat induced the contract formation.\n ✓ The party presenting the threat caused or threatened to cause the \nduress instead of simply taking advantage of it.\nClaims for duress more commonly arise from financial (economic) rather than \nphysical threats. For example, a web developer may hold a client’s website hos -\ntage two days prior to its highly promoted unveiling to force the client to rene -\ngotiate the contract and pay $10,000 more than the total price they originally \nagreed to. Having invested considerable resources and with insufficient time to \nhire a replacement, the client has no recourse but to pay the extra $10,000.\nIn an economic duress case, determining whether the threat is improper and \nwhether the party had a reasonable alternative may be more difficult than \nwith a physical duress case.

You take the car. \nI clearly took advantage of your situation, but I didn’t make an unlawful threat \nor cause the duress (the reason you needed the money so badly). And you \nhad the reasonable alternative of bringing legal proceedings to recover the \n$10,000 from me. (For more about settlement of debts, head to Chapter 12.)\nTaking unfair advantage: The  \nundue influence defense\nUndue influence  is any inappropriate method of persuasion that a dominant \nparty uses to convince a weaker or more vulnerable party to enter into a con -\ntract against his better judgment. One old case described it as “persuasion \nwhich overcomes the will without convincing the judgment.” Using undue \ninfluence to take advantage of a situation results in a voidable contract.\n  When evaluating for undue influence, look for the following common signs:\n ✓ The victim was weaker or more vulnerable, typically due to dependency, \nage (very old or very young), mental or physical disability, illness, social \nisolation, depression, anxiety, and so on.\n ✓ The dominant party initiated the transaction and attempted to prevent \nthe other party from seeking independent advice.\n ✓ The transaction appears suspicious — for example, elderly homeowners \nsell their property for significantly less than market value, even though \nthey owe practically nothing on the mortgage.\nUndue influence plays a major role in deeds, trusts, wills, real estate transac -\ntions, investments, and stock purchases and sales.\nWhoops! The Mistake Defense\nIn contract law, a mistake  is a belief that’s not in accord with the facts. A \nmistake may be mutual (both parties were mistaken) or unilateral  (only one \nparty was mistaken). This section explains how to evaluate a mutual mistake \ndefense, use the mutual mistake defense to get out of a release  (a contract \nin which one party relinquishes all claims in return for something, usually \nmoney), and evaluate a unilateral mistake defense.\n A mistake may make a contract voidable, but the mistake defense is limited. \nPeople are always claiming that they made a mistake in entering a contract; \nfor example, they think that something is worth more or less than it really is. \nBut a bad financial or business decision doesn’t constitute the kind of mistake  \nthat can avoid a contract.\n115  Chapter 7: Evaluating the Parties’ Ability to Make the Contract\nEvaluating a mutual mistake defense\nTo avoid a contract for mutual mistake, a party must show that the mistake \nis mutual, goes to a basic assumption, and is material. In addition, the party \nclaiming the defense must not bear the risk of being mistaken — something I \nget to in a moment.\nTo evaluate a mutual mistake defense, take the following steps:\n 1. Identify the mistaken belief.\n   What did one or both parties believe that was not in accord with the facts?\n 2. Determine whether the mistake is mutual.\n  Did both parties believe the same information? If I think your house \nwould make a great rental property and buy it for that purpose, but you \nhave no opinion on the matter, and then I find that no one wants to rent \nit, then I made a mistake, but you didn’t. The mistake isn’t mutual. I have \nno claim for mutual mistake.\n 3. Determine whether the mistake relates to a basic assumption.\n  A basic assumption  is something the contract hinges on. Would this mis -\ntake reasonably discharge a party from the contract? For example, if we \nagree that your house would make a great rental property, and then it \nturns out to have no value as a rental, the assumption of its being a  \ngood rental property is a basic assumption.\n 4. Determine whether the mistake has a material effect on the transaction.\n  Material  means significant — usually that the financial impact is signifi -\ncant. If you’re looking at a $20,000 transaction, $1,000 may not be mate -\nrial, whereas $10,000 certainly is.\n 5. Determine whether the party seeking to avoid the contract carried  \nthe risk of being mistaken.\n  A party may assume the risk of being mistaken in either of the  \nfollowing ways:\n  • Expressly:  The contract states which party carries the risk. For \nexample, the contract may state, “The buyer has conducted his \nown investigation of the property as a rental and accepts it in  \nits present condition.”\n  • As the business norm:  Subject to some exceptions, the buyer  \nnormally bears the risk that the goods are worth the price.\n Contract law properly places the burden on a party to investigate the facts — he \nshouldn’t treat his assumptions as sufficient. If a person is unwilling to take the \nrisk, then he can bargain for a promise or representation from the other party. \nFor example, instead of taking the risk that your house is a good rental property, \nI could bargain for a contract term that stated something like the following:\n116 Part II: Determining Whether a Contract Is Void, Voidable, or Unenforceable \nSeller warrants and represents that the house will generate monthly  \nrentals of at least $2,000.\nThe fact that most sellers are unwilling to agree to such a term should induce \nbuyers to do their own investigating.\nUsing the mutual mistake defense  \nto escape a release\nMutual mistake is one of the most common defenses raised to avoid a   \nrelease  — a contract in which one party gives up all claims against the other \nin return for a consideration, usually the payment of money. Both parties \nenter into the release believing that a set amount of money is sufficient to \ncover damages. Later, the party who received payment discovers that the \npayment was insufficient and claims a mistake defense to avoid the release \nso she can pursue her original claim.\n For example, if you crash into me on your skateboard and injure my leg, I \nhave a negligence claim against you. My doctor believes that the leg is broken  \nand will heal completely. On that basis, you offer and I accept $10,000 for my \nrelease. Later, I find out that the doctor was wrong. Not only is the leg injury \nworse than we’d thought, but I also have an arm injury the doctor overlooked. \nI try to pursue my claim against you, and you wave the release at me, claim -\ning that it bars any further action. I now have to avoid the release in order to \npursue my claim against you.\nAccording to the step-by-step evaluation process, the situation qualifies as a \nmutual mistake because it meets all the required conditions:\n ✓ The release was based on a mistaken belief.  The extent of the leg inju -\nries and the undiagnosed arm injury are much more serious than the \ncontract reflects.\n ✓ The belief was mutual.  Both you and I contracted for the release based \non the same information from the doctor.\n ✓ The mistaken belief goes to a basic assumption of the contract.  The \nrelease hinges on the assumption that $10,000 will cover the injuries.\n ✓ The mistaken belief has a material effect on the transaction.  Additional \ntreatments along with other losses are likely to cost significantly more \nthan $10,000, so the effect is material.\n ✓ The injured party doesn’t bear the risk of the mistake.  The case will likely \nturn on this factor. I was in a position to evaluate the facts. On the other \nhand, a court may find that we did not intend the release to be binding if \nthere was a mistake as to (1) the unknown consequences of a known injury, \nsuch as the leg injury, or (2) an unknown injury, such as the arm injury.\n117  Chapter 7: Evaluating the Parties’ Ability to Make the Contract\nIn this example, the release is likely to contain language stating the extent to \nwhich I bore the risk. However, the courts will scrutinize that language care -\nfully to see whether they can interpret it in my favor. Even if I released you \nfrom both the extent of the leg injuries and other injuries, including the arm \ninjury, courts don’t like to uphold releases in situations like these. This is \nespecially true when the injured party is an unsophisticated party who wasn’t \nrepresented by an attorney and the other party is an insurance company or a \nworkers’ compensation system. Courts are human, and they often consider fac -\ntors, such as fairness, that aren’t within the elements of mutual mistake.\nFinding relief when the mistake is unilateral\nA unilateral mistake  is an erroneous belief that only one of the parties \nholds. When evaluating a unilateral mistake defense, follow the same steps \nyou’d take for evaluating a mutual mistake defense (see the earlier section \n“Evaluating a mutual mistake defense”), with a slight change in Step 2:\n 1. Identify the mistaken belief.\n 2. Check for evidence showing that the circumstances meet the  \nfollowing conditions:\n  • Only the party seeking to avoid the contract was mistaken.\n  • The other party should’ve known about the mistake, or   \nenforcing the contract would be unconscionable.\n 3. Determine whether the mistake relates to a basic assumption.\n 4. Determine whether the mistake has a material effect on the transaction.\n 5. Determine whether the party seeking to avoid the contract carried the \nrisk of being mistaken.\n The typical situation in which the unilateral mistake arises is a bid by a sub -\ncontractor. Suppose a contractor seeks bids for a job, and a subcontractor \nmakes a bid (offer) of $10,000. The contractor accepts it. The subcontractor \nnow says, “Wait a minute. We put the decimal point in the wrong place. We  \nmeant to bid $100,000.” This mistake is unilateral. If the contractor should’ve \nknown about the mistake because the other bids were coming in at around \n$100,000, then the court will allow the subcontractor to avoid the contract.\nIf, however, the subcontractor bid $90,000 and the other bids were coming \nin at around $100,000, then a contractor may reasonably think this was just a \nlow bid and not a mistake. Also, binding the subcontractor to its promise to \ndo a $100,000 job for $90,000 would not be unconscionable, although binding \nhim to do the job for $10,000 would be unconscionable.\n118 Part II: Determining Whether a Contract Is Void, Voidable, or Unenforceable",10326
47-Challenging Oral Agreements with the Statute of Frauds.pdf,47-Challenging Oral Agreements with the Statute of Frauds,"Chapter 8\nAssessing the Enforceability  \nof Oral Agreements\nIn This Chapter\n▶ Evaluating contract formation in oral agreements\n▶ Knowing which types of agreements must be in writing\n▶ Determining whether a writing is sufficient proof of an agreement\n▶ Recognizing exceptions to the rules\nT \nhe aim of contract law is to give individuals as much freedom as possible \nto form contracts, so the general rule is that oral contacts are just as \nvalid and binding as written contracts. Questions sometimes arise with oral \nagreements, however, over contract formation  (whether the parties intended \nto enter into a binding agreement without a written contract) and contract \ndefense  (whether the contract is enforceable).\nFor example, even when the law allows oral agreements, parties may discuss the \nterms of an agreement with the intent to make a later written contract. Problems \nmay arise, however, if the written contract never happens and one party claims \nthat the discussion constitutes a contract. In such a situation, the challenge is \nto determine the parties’ intent. If the parties intended to make a binding agree -\nment but made it orally, contract law says that in general, oral agreements are \nenforceable. The exceptions to this rule are laid out in the statute of frauds  —  \nthe collective name for statutes that require written evidence of a contract.\nThis chapter tackles both contract formation and contract defense of oral \nagreements. Here, you discover how to evaluate the parties’ intent to form \na binding contract, how to identify a contract that’s within the statute of \nfrauds, and how to satisfy the requirement of a signed writing or prove that \nan exception makes a signed writing unnecessary. (A writing  is any sufficient \nwritten proof of an agreement, such as a handwritten note by one party.)\n120 Part II: Determining Whether a Contract Is Void, Voidable, or Unenforceable \n Oral means spoken as opposed to written. Some people mistakenly refer to oral \ncontracts as verbal when they say something like, “That was just a verbal agree -\nment!” Verbal  means using words,  so oral and written contracts are both verbal. \nNonverbal  is communicating without words, such as by nodding or shaking \none’s head. This chapter focuses on oral agreements — spoken, not written.\nAsking Whether the Parties Intended  \nto Orally Form a Contract\nWhen parties enter into an oral agreement with the intention to reduce their \nagreement to a writing later, a problem often arises. Did they intend to form a \nbinding contract solely through their oral agreement, or did they intend not \nto have a binding contract until they executed the signed writing? The intent \nof the parties determines whether that oral agreement results in a contract.\nProving something that’s as subjective as intent can be difficult. Contract law \nmeets the challenge by examining objective factors, including the following:\n ✓ Whether that particular type of contract is usually found in writing:  If \nthe type of deal is typically executed with a written, signed contract and \nno such contract exists, then the parties’ discussion probably doesn’t \nprove intent to form a contract.\n ✓ Whether the contract requires a formal writing for its full expression:  \nIf the agreement demands precise wording that spoken language is \nunlikely to produce, then discussion of the transaction probably doesn’t \nshow intent to form a contract.\n ✓ The level of detail:  A simple oral agreement with few terms may show \nintent to form a contract. But in a complex deal with numerous terms, \nparties typically expect the agreement to be binding only upon signing a \nwritten contract.\n ✓ The amount involved:  Parties often enter into oral agreements for transac -\ntions of only a few hundred dollars. When parties discuss high-value trans -\nactions, they typically intend to be bound only by a contract in writing.\n ✓ The uniqueness of the deal:  A discussion may show intent to form a \ncontract in common transactions, such as purchasing goods or hiring \nsomeone to perform a job. But if the parties are engaged in an unusual \ndeal, an oral exchange probably doesn’t show that intent.\n ✓ Whether the negotiations indicate that a final signed writing is \nrequired:  If during their discussion one or both parties indicate that \ntheir agreement is valid only upon the signing of a written contract, then \nthey have expressed intent not to form an oral agreement.\n121  Chapter 8: Assessing the Enforceability of Oral Agreements\n For example, the president of BigCo runs into the president of SmallCo at a \ntrade show. The BigCo president says, “We’re interested in acquiring your \ncompany for $10 million. Will you sell?” The SmallCo president says, “It’s a \ndeal.” The BigCo president says, “Great! I’ll have our lawyers get together and \ndraw up the papers,” and they shake hands. Later, when the lawyers are draw -\ning up the papers, the parties encounter a number of problems that they’re \nunable to resolve, and BigCo says it’s not buying SmallCo after all. SmallCo \nresponds, “But we have a contract.”\nThe decision on this case could go either way. On the one hand, the oral \nagreement appears binding because\n ✓ No rule requires a writing for the purchase of a business.\n ✓ It’s foggy whether the parties intended for the agreement to be enforce -\nable only after the agreement had been written up and signed. The par -\nties seemed to view the written contract as a mere formality.\nOn the other hand, the oral agreement doesn’t seem binding because\n ✓ The consideration of $10 million is substantial. People wouldn’t nor -\nmally execute such a transaction without a written agreement.\n ✓ The details of an agreement to sell a $10 million business are considerable. \nThis isn’t the type of simple transaction to be sealed with a handshake.\nThe parties in this transaction should’ve made clear at the outset that any \nagreements weren’t binding until written and signed by both parties.\n Often, the parties to a complex deal proceed in stages, securing agreement at \neach stage, with an understanding that they have no binding agreement until \nthey reach the final stage. To avoid misunderstandings, parties involved in such \ntransactions should make their intent clear in initial documents. Many parties \nuse an initial transaction called a Letter of Intent  or Memorandum of Understanding  \nthat indicates they’re not bound until they enter into a final, signed agreement.\nChallenging Oral Agreements  \nwith the Statute of Frauds\nA transaction is within the statute of frauds when a statute requires that the trans -\naction be evidenced by a writing (written proof of the agreement). This require -\nment exists largely for historical reasons, but it arguably serves four functions:\n122 Part II: Determining Whether a Contract Is Void, Voidable, or Unenforceable \n ✓ Fraud prevention:  As its name suggests, the main purpose of the stat -\nute of frauds is to prevent fraud. The statute prevents a person from \nclaiming that someone entered into a contract when he really didn’t. For \nexample, if you claim that I agreed to sell you a certain baseball card for \n$500 when I really didn’t, the statute of frauds says that the agreement \nisn’t enforceable unless you can prove that a writing exists.\n ✓ Cautionary:  The cautionary function serves as a warning to reflect on \nwhat you’re doing — this is serious business, so you had better take the \ntrouble to put the agreement in writing.\n ✓ Channeling:  The statute channels behavior, encouraging parties to get \ncertain types of agreements in writing. If you fear that your oral agree -\nment won’t be enforced, you have an incentive to put it in writing, thus \nmaking it easier for courts to find the agreement.\n ✓ Evidentiary:  Having the agreement in writing provides a valuable piece \nof evidence to prove that the parties entered into a contract and speci -\nfies its terms.\nThe transactions that are within the statute of frauds developed historically \nand seem somewhat arbitrary. In this section, you discover which kinds of \ntransactions fall under this statute and how the statute can render oral  \nagreements unenforceable.\nDetermining whether a transaction  \nis within the statute of frauds\n To determine whether a transaction is within the statute of frauds, check \nwhether the transaction is any of the following:\n ✓ An agreement concerning real estate\n ✓ An agreement to rent real property for longer than a year\n ✓ An agreement that can’t be performed within a year from the making\n ✓ An agreement to answer for the duty of another\n ✓ An agreement for the sale of goods for $500 or more\nThis section examines each of these types of transactions, which must be  \nevidenced by a writing to be enforceable.\n Although contract law refers to the statute of frauds, each state has its own \nstatute of frauds, so check the statute in your jurisdiction for specifics. \n(Historically, English law had a Statute of Frauds,  enacted in 1677, that listed \nvarious transactions. American jurisdictions copied the law, but individual \njurisdictions aren’t required to enact the same law. Curiously, the English \nlargely repealed their statue in 1954!)\n123  Chapter 8: Assessing the Enforceability of Oral Agreements\nReal estate transactions\nA real estate transaction  is any transaction involving the sale of land and \nimprovements (houses, buildings, and other structures) on that land. Applying \nthe statute to real estate transactions probably serves the statute’s caution -\nary function because real estate transactions often involve a lot of money and \nrequire a clear understanding of how the buyer is to pay and take possession.\nLeasing property for longer than a year\nIf a party is leasing a property for more than one year, the agreement must \nbe in writing, but shorter leases are an exception. The reasoning behind this \nseems to be that short-term rentals don’t necessarily involve a lot of money. \nIf Joe agrees to rent Mary an apartment for $500 per month for three months, \nthat transaction is relatively insignificant both in duration and dollar amount. \nIn most jurisdictions, an oral lease of real property for one year or less isn’t \nwithin the statute of frauds, so it’s enforceable.\nAgreements that can’t be performed within a year from the making\nAn agreement is within the statute if it can’t by its terms be performed within \na year from the making. The phrase by its terms  is key here. If for $2 billion, \na contractor orally agrees to build a nuclear power plant in six months, that \nagreement can by its terms  be performed within a year because the terms give \nthe contractor six months to build it. The agreement isn’t within the statute \nof frauds, so this particular oral agreement is enforceable.\n If the oral agreement can be performed within a year, regardless of that likeli -\nhood, then it’s enforceable. For example, if you orally agree to take care of a \n20-year-old for the rest of her life, the term “the rest of her life” could end up \nmeaning six months. Because the 20-year-old could die before the year is up, \nthe oral agreement isn’t within the statute of frauds. If the 20-year-old lives 60 \nmore years, that oral agreement is still enforceable over those 60 years.\nThis provision presumably serves the cautionary function (because a person  \nis entering into a long-term commitment) and the evidentiary function \n(because evidence becomes stale over time); however, this provision can  \nbar enforcement of an oral agreement even when the evidence is fresh.\n For example, assume that Joe orally hires Mary to provide housecleaning ser -\nvices for him for two years. A week later, he terminates the contract without \ncause, claiming that the agreement isn’t enforceable because it couldn’t be \nperformed within a year from its making. Even though the agreement is  \nonly a week old, Mary would have to produce a writing that Joe signed to \nmake it enforceable.\nIf they’d made the same agreement for services for 11 months and Joe tried \nto terminate it 6 months later, the agreement would fall outside the statute of \nfrauds. Mary would have to prove only that they had an oral agreement even \nthough the evidence is now six months old.\n124 Part II: Determining Whether a Contract Is Void, Voidable, or Unenforceable \nAgreements to answer for the duty of another\nWhen a third party (a person not a party to the contract) — who often \ngets no benefit from the transaction — agrees with a creditor to perform if \nsomeone else doesn’t (often called a suretyship agreement ), the agreement \nis typically within the statute of frauds. This probably serves the cautionary \nfunction of the statute, ensuring that the third party understands the serious -\nness of what may be an informal agreement.\n For example, Tom agrees to buy goods from Dick on credit. Dick’s concerned \nthat Tom may not be able to pay, so Harry agrees to pay Dick if Tom doesn’t. \nHarry’s agreement to answer for Tom’s duty must be evidenced by a writing. \nIn this example, the promise is made by the surety (Harry) to the creditor \n(Dick), not to the debtor (Tom).\nThe situation would be different if the surety instead makes the promise \nto the debtor. If Tom says to Harry, “I have this debt to Dick, and I’m wor -\nried that I won’t be able to pay it,” and Harry tells Tom, “Don’t worry, if you \ncan’t pay, I’ll cover you,” then Harry’s promise doesn’t have to be in writing \nbecause it was made to Tom (the debtor), not Dick (the creditor).\nAgreements that involve the sale of goods for $500 or more\nUnder the UCC, transactions for the sale of goods for $500 or more are within \nthe statute. UCC § 2-201(1), as enacted in North Carolina, provides:\n§ 25-2-201. Formal requirements; statute of frauds.\n(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section a contract for the sale of \ngoods for the price of five hundred dollars ($500.00) or more is not enforce -\nable by way of action or defense unless there is some writing sufficient to \nindicate that a contract for sale has been made between the parties and \nsigned by the party against whom enforcement is sought or by his autho -\nrized agent or broker. A writing is not insufficient because it omits or incor -\nrectly states a term agreed upon but the contract is not enforceable under \nthis paragraph beyond the quantity of goods shown in such writing.\nThis statute probably serves the cautionary function (though $500 isn’t what \nit used to be in the 1950s, when the statute was first enacted).\nNote that the writing only has to be signed by one of the parties — “the party \nagainst whom enforcement is sought.” If I orally agree to sell a baseball card \nto you for $500 and you claim the statute of frauds defense, then I’d have to \nprove the contract with a writing you had signed; if I claim the defense, then \nyou’d have to produce a writing I had signed.\n125  Chapter 8: Assessing the Enforceability of Oral Agreements\nDistinguishing between voidable  \nand unenforceable agreements\nSometimes courts say that an oral agreement within the statute of frauds \nis void or invalid.  That statement isn’t accurate, because like a voidable \ncontract, the oral agreement is perfectly good unless one party offers proof \nthat vitiates  it (destroys its legal validity). Saying it’s unenforceable  is better, \nbecause the statute may affect only one party and not the entire agreement. \nHere’s the difference:\n ✓ Voidable:  If a party claims an agreement is voidable, then that party may \npresent evidence that no contract was formed. If the evidence is success -\nful, then the parties don’t have a contract and are returned to their pre-\ncontract positions. (Chapter 6 provides examples of voidable contracts.)\n  When a contract is within the statute of frauds, the issue isn’t whether \nthe contract was in fact made. People are sometimes concerned that \nwithout a writing, they won’t be able to prove they made a contract — \nthey say, “It’s just his word against mine!” But that’s why society has \ncourts and trials. If you state something as a fact in court or present \ncredible witnesses to say it and a court believes it, then it’s proven.\n ✓ Unenforceable:  If a party claims that a contract is within the statute of \nfrauds, he may present evidence that he didn’t sign any writing. That may \nmake the contract unenforceable against him, but it doesn’t avoid  the con -\ntract (return the parties to their pre-contract positions). The contract may \nstill be enforceable against the other party if that party signed a writing.Looking at criticism of the statute of frauds\nCritics challenge the statute of frauds on a few \ngrounds:\n ✓ The transactions within the statute seem \narbitrary.  The sale of a $10 million busi -\nness isn’t within the statute, but the sale \nof a $500 baseball card is. Moreover, the \nstatute covers the sale of a baseball card \nfor $500, but it doesn’t cover the sale of the \nsame card for $499.\n ✓ The statute is unfair.  Critics of the rule think \nit’s unfair for people to avoid agreements they made merely because they didn’t \nsign a written agreement. For example, if I \nagree to sell you a baseball card for $500, \nI shouldn’t be able to use the statute of \nfrauds to get out of the contract by saying, \n“Sure, I agreed to sell you the baseball card \nfor $500, but you can’t enforce it because I \ndidn’t sign anything saying I would.”\nFor these reasons, courts are wary of enforc -\ning the statute and often look for ways to get \naround its strict application.",17751
48-Finding Exceptions to the Statute.pdf,48-Finding Exceptions to the Statute,"126 Part II: Determining Whether a Contract Is Void, Voidable, or Unenforceable \n A contract within the statute of frauds isn’t enforceable unless there’s a writ -\ning signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought. If you signed a \nwriting and the other party didn’t, then the other party can enforce the con -\ntract against you, but you can’t enforce it against the other party.\nFinding a Writing That  \nSatisfies the Statute\nUCC § 2-201(1) — the UCC statute I quote earlier in “Agreements that involve \nthe sale of goods for $500 or more” — is typical of other statutes of frauds in \nstating that the contract isn’t enforceable “unless there is some writing suf -\nficient to indicate that a contract for sale has been made between the parties \nand signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought.”\n Under the statute of frauds, the contract doesn’t have to be in writing; it just \nhas to be evidenced by  a writing. Don’t make the writing do too much work. \nCourts often show that they disfavor the statute by accepting informal writ -\nings to satisfy it. Whether that writing is good enough to satisfy the statute \ndepends on whether it satisfies both of the following conditions:\n ✓ Sufficiently describes the contract\n ✓ Is signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought\n For example, Tom orally agrees to sell his house to Mary for $300,000. Tom \nthen goes to his lawyer’s office and, finding that she’s not there, leaves a note \non her desk that says “Just sold my house to Mary for $300,000. Please draw \nup the papers. — Tom .” Tom then gets a better offer on the house and refuses \nto sell it to Mary, claiming that their contract is within the statute of frauds. \nIf Mary discovers the note that Tom left for his lawyer, then she can produce \nit as evidence of a writing that satisfies the statute, because the note (1) suf -\nficiently describes their contract and (2) is signed by Tom.\nThis section explains the two conditions necessary to satisfy the statute of \nfrauds in greater detail.\nDoes it describe the contract?\nAlthough the writing must indicate that the parties entered into a contract, the \nwriting doesn’t have to be the contract — it only needs to serve as evidence \nthat the oral contract exists by identifying the parties, the subject matter, and \nthe essential terms of the contract. The UCC statute of frauds specifically says \nthat a “writing is not insufficient because it omits or incorrectly states a term \n127  Chapter 8: Assessing the Enforceability of Oral Agreements\nagreed upon.” The court may fill in the details of the agreement with the par -\nties’ testimony or with gap fillers (as I discuss in Chapter 3).\n Although the writing doesn’t need to include all the contract terms, for the \nwriting to be sufficient under the UCC, it must include the quantity sold. If \nTom Smith buys widgets and produces a signed memo from the seller stating, \n“Just sold Tom Smith Type X widgets,” that writing would be insufficient to \nprove the contract because even though it identifies the parties and the sub -\nject matter, it fails to state a quantity. If the signed writing stated, “Just sold \nTom Smith 100 Type X widgets,” the buyer would be able to enforce a contract \nfor the sale of 100 widgets. If the seller actually had agreed to sell 200 widgets, \nhowever, the writing couldn’t prove that.\nIs it signed by the party against  \nwhom enforcement is sought?\nAlthough the statute requires a writing signed by the party against whom \nenforcement is sought, courts are generally very lenient when determining \nwhat constitutes a writing and whether it’s signed. The UCC includes the fol -\nlowing definitions, as enacted in North Carolina 25-1-201(b)(37) and (43):\n(37) “Signed” includes using any symbol executed or adopted with pres -\nent intention to adopt or accept a writing.\n(43) “Writing” includes printing, typewriting, or any other intentional \nreduction to tangible form. “Written” has a corresponding meaning.\nUnder these definitions, a memo on the letterhead of a business could consti -\ntute a signed writing. The name of the business on the letterhead is a symbol \n“adopted with the present intention to adopt” the writing as coming from \nthat business. Many courts have brought the concept into the electronic age \nby finding that an e-mail is a signed writing. The sender or signature line indi -\ncates the intention of the sender to adopt it. Even though the e-mail exists \nonly in cyberspace, printing reduces it to tangible form.\nFinding Exceptions to the Statute\nAs a matter of policy, courts tend to treat agreements as enforceable unless \npresented with good evidence to the contrary. A court may narrow the scope \nof the statute of frauds so fewer transactions fall within it and liberally inter -\npret the requirement of a signed writing to make an agreement enforceable. \nIn addition, the court may find exceptions to the statute of frauds in reliance, \nmain purpose, restitution, and statutory exceptions in the UCC. The following \nsections explain these exceptions.\n128 Part II: Determining Whether a Contract Is Void, Voidable, or Unenforceable \nMcIntosh v. Murphy:  Taking multiple  \nviews of the statute of frauds\nThe case of McIntosh v. Murphy  shows how \ndivided courts are about the statute of frauds. \nAccording to the facts found by the jury, on \nSaturday, April 25, Murphy, who ran a car deal -\nership in Hawaii, telephoned McIntosh, who was \nin California, to tell him that a job was open and \nwork would begin on Monday. McIntosh moved \nto Hawaii and began work on Monday, April \n27. Less than three months later, Murphy fired \nMcIntosh. McIntosh sued for breach of contract. \nMurphy claimed that the employment was “at \nwill,” meaning McIntosh could be discharged \nat any time. The jury, however, found that the \ncontract was for a year’s duration, that Murphy \nwas in breach for letting him go during that time, \nand that McIntosh was entitled to damages in the \namount of some $12,000.\nMurphy appealed on the grounds that the jury \nhadn’t been asked to determine whether the \ncontract had been formed on Saturday or on \nMonday. The contract could’ve been formed by \nMcIntosh’s promise to perform on Saturday or by \nhis performance of showing up on Monday. What \ndifference would that make? If the oral contract \nwas formed on Monday, then it would’ve been \nfully performed a year later. That scenario would \npresent no problem with the statute of frauds. But \nif it was formed on Saturday, it would not be fully \nperformed until a year from Monday, which is a \ntotal of a year and two days. Under that scenario, \nthe parties would have an oral contract that by its \nterms couldn’t be performed within a year from \nits making, so it would need to be in writing to be \nenforceable — no writing, no enforceability, and \nMurphy’s off the hook!The trial judge, the majority in the appellate \ncourt, and the dissent in the appellate court all \ntook different views of the statute of frauds:\n ✓ The trial judge said that applying the stat -\nute of frauds made the law look ridiculous, \nso he essentially said that weekends don’t \ncount when computing time.\n ✓ The majority in the appellate court worked \naround the statute of frauds by creating \nan exception based on reliance. Even if \nthe agreement was within the statute of \nfrauds, McIntosh had reasonably relied \non Murphy’s promise, so the court let the \ndecision stand. (According to this view, \nMcIntosh should’ve recovered only what \nhe spent in reliance — the cost of relo -\ncating to Hawaii to take the job. However, \nthe jury based McIntosh’s damages on the \nexpectancy — what he would’ve earned \nhad the contract been completed.)\n ✓ The dissent thought that the role of the \ncourt was to follow the dictates of the leg -\nislature, and if the legislature had enacted \na statute of frauds, then the courts should \ncarry out the law regardless of the hard -\nship that would cause. In other words, if \nthe contract was formed on Saturday, \nMcIntosh shouldn’t be entitled to dam -\nages, because the oral agreement was \nunenforceable.\nThis variety of views isn’t surprising, given that \nthe statute of frauds is so controversial.\n129  Chapter 8: Assessing the Enforceability of Oral Agreements\nRevisiting reliance\nIf a contract is within the statute of frauds and isn’t evidenced by a writing, \na court may nevertheless enforce the promise because of reliance (a party \nchanges her position in response to another party’s promise). For example, \nalthough real estate transactions are within the statute of frauds, an oral \nagreement may be enforceable if a party relies on it. (For more about reli -\nance, see Chapter 4.)\n Assume that Joe orally agrees to sell a tract of land to Mary for $300,000. With \nJoe’s consent, Mary takes possession of the land and builds a house on it. Joe \nthen refuses to sell the land to Mary, raising the statute of frauds as a defense. \nA court would likely find that Mary’s reasonable and substantial reliance on \nJoe’s promise bars him from raising the statute of frauds as a defense.\nFinding an exception in  \nthe main purpose rule\nThe main purpose rule applies to suretyship agreements, in which a third party \nagrees to perform if another party doesn’t. The main purpose rule arises if the \nmain purpose of the third party’s agreement is for his own financial advantage. In \nsuch a case, contract law has less reason to caution the third party because the \nparty recognizes the potential risks and benefits of entering into the agreement. \nTherefore, the statute of frauds doesn’t apply and the agreement is enforceable.\n Suppose Tom is building a house for Harry, and Tom has a duty to pay for mate -\nrials. Tom fails to pay Dick’s Lumber, and Dick refuses to provide more materi -\nals. To get the house built, Harry calls and tells Dick he’ll pay for the materials \nTom ordered. That oral agreement isn’t within the statute of frauds, because the \nmain purpose of the promise Harry made was to benefit himself.\nExamining part performance and restitution\nWhether part performance  (partial performance of the contract terms) creates \nan exception under the statute of frauds is under debate. Some performances \nare not performances of the contract but may serve as evidence of reliance and \nfunction as an exception to the statute of frauds. However, if the court doesn’t \naccept the part performance as evidence that makes the contract enforceable, \nthen a party may recover the value of that performance in restitution.\n130 Part II: Determining Whether a Contract Is Void, Voidable, or Unenforceable \n For example, if Tom orally agrees to buy Mary’s house for $300,000, she may \nask for $3,000 as a down payment. If Tom signs a check with a notation on it \nindicating what it’s for, that check may be enough to constitute a writing Tom \nsigned, evidencing the agreement. If Mary endorses the check, that may con -\nstitute a writing she signed. Mary’s acceptance of $3,000 in cash, however, \nmay be part performance, but it isn’t evidence of the agreement. If a court \nfinds the agreement unenforceable, then John has conferred a benefit on Mary \nthat wasn’t a gift and wasn’t officious. In restitution, Tom should have a claim \nfor the recovery of the $3,000.\nFinding exceptions in UCC § 2-201\nThe UCC statute of frauds contains a number of unique exceptions that result \nin the enforcement of an agreement that’s otherwise unenforceable under the \nUCC’s statute of frauds. These exceptions include the merchants’ confirma -\ntion, specially manufactured goods, performance, and admission, as I discuss \nin the following sections.\nConfirming the contract by sending a writing\nThe confirmation exception,  which applies only between merchants, states that \nconfirmation of an oral agreement sent by one party is binding on the receiving \nparty if that party doesn’t object to it in a reasonable amount of time. UCC § \n2-201(2), as enacted in North Carolina at 25-2-201(2), provides the following:\n(2) Between merchants if within a reasonable time a writing in confirma -\ntion of the contract and sufficient against the sender is received and the \nparty receiving it has reason to know its contents, it satisfies the require -\nments of subsection (1) against such party unless written notice of objec -\ntion to its contents is given within ten days after it is received.\n For example, a grain buyer from Minneapolis sweeps across the northern \nplains, making oral agreements to buy wheat from farmers. The buyer records \nthe orders in his books and then sends confirmations to the farmers when he \nreturns to the office. At harvest time, a farmer discovers that he could get a \nbetter price elsewhere and claims he’s not bound by the oral agreement. The \nbuyer raises the confirmation defense.\nSome farmers have eluded this exception to the statute by claiming that they’re \nnot merchants. This seems to be a poor argument in an era when farmers are \nsavvy about market prices, but it has persuaded a few sympathetic courts.\n131  Chapter 8: Assessing the Enforceability of Oral Agreements\nSpecially manufacturing the goods\nThe UCC’s statute of frauds doesn’t apply to specially manufactured  goods — \nwhen a seller begins to manufacture goods for a buyer under an oral agreement. \nUCC § 2-201(3)(a), as enacted in North Carolina at 25-2-201(3)(a), provides:\n  (3) A contract which does not satisfy the requirements of subsection (1) \nbut which is valid in other respects is enforceable\n  (a) if the goods are to be specially manufactured for the buyer \nand are not suitable for sale to others in the ordinary course of \nthe seller’s business and the seller, before notice of repudiation is \nreceived and under circumstances which reasonably indicate that \nthe goods are for the buyer, has made either a substantial begin -\nning of their manufacture or commitments for their procurement.\n For example, for a business I’m planning, I order a neon sign that says “Scott’s \nKontracts Krafted Kwik.” I lose interest and cancel the order. The seller says, \n“We’re nearly done making it.” I say, “I don’t care. The agreement was oral, so \nit’s unenforceable.” I’ll lose that argument because the seller reasonably relied \non my request for the specially manufactured goods and is unlikely to find \nanother buyer for the sign.\nPerforming the contract\nAfter the parties have performed the contract, it’s too late to claim that \nthe contract is unenforceable based on the UCC’s statute of frauds. This \nis because of the doctrine of waiver:  Each party had the right to raise the \ndefense but gave it up. Mutual performance proves that both parties went \nalong with the agreement, so neither party could’ve been defrauded. This \nrule is found both in the common law and in the UCC. UCC § 2-201(3)(c), as \nenacted in North Carolina at 25-2-201(3)(c), provides\n  (3) A contract which does not satisfy the requirements of subsection  \n(1) but which is valid in other respects is enforceable [. . .]\n  (c) with respect to goods for which payment has been made and \naccepted or which have been received and accepted\nAdmitting making the contract\nUnder the admission exception to the statute of frauds, if a party admits \nunder oath to making an oral contract, the contract is enforceable despite \nthe absence of a writing. UCC § 2-201(3)(b), as enacted in North Carolina at \n25-2-201(3)(b), provides\n132 Part II: Determining Whether a Contract Is Void, Voidable, or Unenforceable \n  (3) A contract which does not satisfy the requirements of subsection  \n(1) but which is valid in other respects is enforceable [. . .]\n  (b) if the party against whom enforcement is sought admits in his \npleading, testimony or otherwise in court that a contract for sale \nwas made, but the contract is not enforceable under this provision \nbeyond the quantity of goods admitted.\nThis exception to the signed writing requirement is the most interesting and \nreveals concerns with the policies behind the statute of frauds. The excep -\ntion discourages parties from making agreements and then claiming that they \ndon’t have to honor them.\n Suppose I agreed to sell you a certain baseball card for $500 and then tried to \nweasel out of it in court by saying, “Sure, I agreed to sell you that baseball \ncard for $500, but you can’t produce a signed writing that evidences the agree -\nment, so you’re out of luck.” Under the admission exception to the statute, I \nwouldn’t be able to get away with that. By admitting that we made the agree -\nment, I lose the benefit of the statute!\nLooking for a statute of frauds that didn’t exist\nA fascinating case in the Oregon Court of \nAppeals involved the sale of cedar shakes \nfrom a Canadian corporation to an American \ncorporation. The agreement was oral, and the \nseller had sent a written confirmation to the \nbuyer, but the parties differed in their opinion \nas to whether the document constituted a con -\nfirmation that would satisfy the Oregon UCC, \nwhich the parties had assumed governed the \nagreement. They spent a great deal of time and \nmoney arguing about whether the confirmation \nwas sufficient to satisfy the statute of frauds.\nThen a judge on the court woke up and real -\nized that the parties had made a mistake: The \ncontract lacked a choice-of-law provision,  \nso the United Nations Convention on Contracts \nfor the International Sale of Goods (CISG) gov -\nerned the agreement. The CISG is like an inter -national UCC that applies to businesses located \nin countries that have signed onto it — and \nboth the United States and Canada are signa -\ntories. Therefore, the CISG should’ve provided \nthe applicable law. The punch line is that the \nCISG provides that no statute of frauds applies \nto international agreements for the sale of \ngoods! Article 11 states in full:\n  A contract of sale need not be concluded in \nor evidenced by writing and is not subject to \nany other requirement as to form. It may be \nproved by any means, including witnesses.\nThe moral of the story: Carefully scrutinize all \ncontracts, especially international contracts, \nto determine the rules that govern them either \nby default or by a choice-of-law provision in \nthe contract.\n133  Chapter 8: Assessing the Enforceability of Oral Agreements\nNote, however, that the admission defense is available only in a case arising \nunder Article 2 of the UCC, meaning that the agreement involves the sale of \ngoods, and it applies only to an admission made under oath.\n Don’t make the common mistake of thinking that the UCC doesn’t apply to the \nsale of goods for less than $500. The UCC applies to all sales of goods. If the sale is \nfor less than $500, then the UCC statute of frauds  doesn’t apply to the transaction.\nFinding a big exception in  \ninternational contracts\nWhen writing or evaluating international contracts, be aware that different \nstatutes may come into play and, along with them, you may encounter a dif -\nferent or nonexistent statute of frauds. The United Nations Convention on \nContracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG), for example, has no stat -\nute of frauds — oral contracts need not be evidenced by a writing and may \nbe proven by any means, including witnesses.\n134 Part II: Determining Whether a Contract Is Void, Voidable, or Unenforceable",19572

51-Asking Why the Evidence Is Being Offered.pdf,51-Asking Why the Evidence Is Being Offered,"Chapter 9\nEvaluating Unwritten Terms  \nwith the Parol Evidence Rule\nIn This Chapter\n▶ Grasping the difference between parol evidence and the parol evidence rule\n▶ Recognizing when the parol evidence rule does and doesn’t apply\n▶ Deciding whether the parties intended their written agreement to be final and complete\n▶ Determining whether the parol evidence supplements or contradicts the contract\n▶ Avoiding the parol evidence rule by getting everything in writing\nA \ns parties form agreements, they often discuss terms that fail to make \ntheir way into the written agreement. In such cases, one party may later \nclaim that the parties agreed to a term that’s not in the writing, saying some -\nthing like, “Just before I signed the contract, you told me you’d do such and \nsuch.” This party believes that the agreement goes beyond the writing and \nincludes all the terms in the written contract plus other agreed-upon terms \nthat don’t appear in the written contract.\nThe other party, looking at the written contract, says, “I don’t see that term in \nthe contract.” In other words, that party believes that because the term’s not  \nin the written contract, it’s not part of the agreement and shouldn’t be enforced.\nWho’s right? This situation is where the parol evidence rule comes into play. \nCourts use the parol evidence rule to determine whether evidence presented \nfor the purpose of adding a term to a written, signed contract is admissible. \nThis chapter explains the parol evidence rule and how to use it along with \nother relevant information to determine whether a term the parties agreed  \nto outside the written contract is actually part of their agreement.\nIntroducing the Parol Evidence Rule\n The parol evidence rule  resolves the problem of whether a term that’s not in \nthe written contract is part of the agreement between the parties. The rule \nstates the following:\n138 Part III: Analyzing Contract Terms and Their Meaning \nOnce the parties have reduced their agreement to a writing that they intend \nto contain the final and complete statement of their agreement, then evi -\ndence of terms that would supplement or contradict it are not admissible.\nAt first glance, the parol evidence rule appears to say that if the term is not in \nthe written contract, it’s not part of the agreement. However, the rule is not \nthat simple. Read the rule closely, and you find references to issues that can \nbe argued in court:\n ✓ Whether the parties intended  the writing to contain the final and  \ncomplete statement of their agreement\n ✓ Whether the writing was final\n ✓ Whether the writing was complete\nIn addition, courts must determine whether the parol evidence rule even \napplies to a specific contract or term based on the party’s purpose in  \npresenting that evidence.\n Oral contracts are generally enforceable, subject only to the statute of frauds \n(see Chapter 8). If you can prove that the parties formed an oral contract, then \nproving its terms becomes a question of fact. That is, if you can prove to a \ncourt that both parties agreed to a term, then that term becomes part of the \ncontract, regardless of whether it’s in writing.\nHowever, as a practical matter and to avoid future disputes, most parties should \nand do document the terms of the agreement in a written, signed contract.\nIdentifying Parol Evidence:  \nThe Stuff outside the Writing\nWhenever a party claims that the parties agreed to a term that’s not in the \nwritten contract, the first step is to identify the parol evidence,  evidence \nthat’s not included in (that’s extrinsic to) the written contract. Parol evi -\ndence often takes the following forms:\n ✓ Spoken term:  Parol evidence usually takes the form of a promise one \nparty made or a term that the parties agreed to orally. The word parol  \ncomes from the French word meaning “speech,” but parol evidence \ndoesn’t have to be oral.\n ✓ Another document:  Written evidence may show that the parties’ agree -\nment is found in more than one place.\n ✓ Custom and usage:  Parties often exclude terms supplied by trade usage  \n(standard usage in a particular industry or business) from their written \nagreements. See Chapter 11 for details on trade usage.\n139  Chapter 9: Evaluating Unwritten Terms with the Parol Evidence Rule\nWhatever form the parol evidence takes, your first job is to identify it.\n In the famous case of Mitchill v. Lath,  the buyer of a house claimed that the \nseller had orally promised to tear down an unsightly ice house (a shed used \nto store ice for year-round use) on property across the street. The parol evi -\ndence in this case is the seller’s oral promise to tear down the ice house. The \nseller claimed that, under the parol evidence rule, evidence of the promise \nwasn’t admissible because it wasn’t contained in the written contract. (Later, \nin “Recognizing the difference between subjective and objective intent,” you \nsee how the courts applied the parol evidence rule in this particular case.)\n Don’t confuse parol evidence  with the parol evidence rule.  Parol evidence  is \npretty much synonymous with extrinsic evidence.  However, not all parol evi -\ndence invokes the parol evidence rule. To invoke the rule, the evidence must \nbe presented as proof that a term not in the written contract needs to be \nadded to it. After identifying the parol evidence, the next step is to determine \nwhether that evidence invokes the parol evidence rule.\nAsking Why the Evidence Is Being Offered\nParties have different reasons for presenting parol evidence. Your job is to iden -\ntify the reason so you can begin to determine whether it invokes the parol evi -\ndence rule. Ask, “What’s the purpose of this evidence?” The answer determines \nwhether the parol evidence rule applies and how the court is likely to apply it.\n Only parol evidence presented to prove a term of the contract invokes the \nparol evidence rule. Parol evidence presented for one of the following reasons \nusually doesn’t invoke the parol evidence rule:\n ✓ To prove a modification\n ✓ To prove a defense to formation\n ✓ To prove an unfulfilled condition\n ✓ To prove the meaning of a term\nThis section explains each of these reasons and helps you determine whether \nthe parol evidence invokes the parol evidence rule.\n The question “What’s the purpose of this evidence?” often comes up in court. \nAssume, for example, that the seller in Mitchill  has refused to tear down the \nice house as promised (see the preceding section for more about Mitchill ). \nThe buyer sues for breach of contract. At trial, the buyer testifies, “The seller \npromised us that he would—” Before he can complete his sentence, the \nseller’s lawyer jumps out of her seat and says, “Objection.” At this point, the \njudge may excuse the jury so he can decide a matter of law in order to rule on \n140 Part III: Analyzing Contract Terms and Their Meaning \nthe objection. He would then ask the buyer’s lawyer, “For what purpose are \nyou offering this evidence?” If you’re that lawyer, you’d better have a good \nanswer. This section provides the guidance you need.\nTo prove a modification\nAfter parties make an agreement, they’re free to change its terms through \nmodification (see Chapter 12). The parol evidence rule doesn’t apply to \nchanges made after signing. To determine whether the parol evidence rule \napplies to a term, find out when the parties agreed to it:\n ✓ Before signing the agreement:  If a party offering proof of a term not \nfound in the writing says that the parties agreed to the term before they \nsigned the agreement, then the parol evidence rule applies.\n ✓ After signing the agreement:  If the parties agreed to the term after they \nsigned the agreement, then the parol evidence rule doesn’t apply, and \nyou’re dealing with a modification issue.\n In the Mitchill  case, for example, if the buyer told the judge, “Before we signed \nthe agreement, while we were still negotiating, the seller promised me that he \nwould remove the ice house,” then you’d have a parol evidence rule issue.  \nBut if he told the judge, “After we signed the agreement, I asked him if he \nwould remove the ice house and he said he would,” then you’re looking  \nat a modification issue.\nTo prove a defense to formation\nIf one party presents parol evidence to support a defense to formation (claim -\ning the parties didn’t actually form a contract), then the parol evidence rule \nusually doesn’t apply. In such cases, you’re probably dealing with an issue of \ncontract formation, as discussed in Part II.\nIn general, the parol evidence rule doesn’t bar evidence of factors that may inval -\nidate a contract, such as fraud, mutual mistake, lack of capacity, or duress. For \nexample, if a buyer wants to testify, “Before we signed the agreement, the seller \nthreatened me to sign it or else, so I signed it,” then you’re dealing with a con -\ntract formation issue, namely duress, and not with a parol evidence rule issue.\n The purpose of the parol evidence rule is to find the terms of the agreement, \nnot to question whether the parties formed an enforceable contract.\n Using parol evidence to prove a contract defense may work against your client, \nvoiding the contract when what your client really wants is to keep the contract \nand add a term. If, in the Mitchill  case, the buyer proves a formation defense, \nthen he may be out of the contract, but that’s not what he wants. He wants to \n141  Chapter 9: Evaluating Unwritten Terms with the Parol Evidence Rule\nbuy the house and have the seller remove the ugly ice house across the street. \nHe wants to keep the contract and prove that the term was part of it.\nTo prove an unfulfilled condition\nIn agreements that contain conditional terms outside the written contract, \nthe parol evidence rule doesn’t apply. For example, suppose a buyer agrees \nto purchase a seller’s car on condition that the seller has the muffler and \nbrakes replaced. They draw up and sign a contract to document the sale of \nthe car but omit the part about replacing the muffler and brakes.\nIn most jurisdictions, the parol evidence rule doesn’t apply to cases in which \na party presents evidence to prove a condition that’s not in the written \nagreement. As with evidence to prove a formation issue, the court will admit \nevidence that shows the parties agreed that performance was subject to a \ncondition. If performance is subject to a condition, then a party doesn’t have \nto perform if the condition doesn’t occur, as I explain in Chapter 14.\n The problem with offering parol evidence to prove a condition is that it may \nnot get the party what she wants. The buyer wants this car with a new muf -\nfler and brakes. If the buyer successfully proves that getting the muffler and \nbrakes was a condition to performance of the contract, then she doesn’t have \nto perform if that condition didn’t occur; in this case, she doesn’t have to buy \nthe car. But that doesn’t get her what she wants.\nTo prove the meaning of a term\nIf the parties disagree over the meaning of language in the contract, as they \noften do, the court doesn’t apply the parol evidence rule to clarify the mean -\ning. Chapter 11 reveals how the courts deal with questions of interpretation.\n In Mitchill v. Lath,  for example, suppose the written contract contained the \nseller’s promise to “make the ice house more attractive-looking.” The seller \ndoes some work on it, but the buyer thinks it’s still ugly. The seller refuses to \ndo any more. In order to resolve the dispute, the court would have to deter -\nmine the meaning of “more attractive-looking.” That’s not a parol evidence \nrule issue because the disputed term is in the writing.\nTo add a term to the agreement\nWhen a party presents evidence to add a term to the agreement, the parol \nevidence rule comes into play, assuming that both of the following are true:",11997
52-Deciding Whether the Agreement Is Final and Complete.pdf,52-Deciding Whether the Agreement Is Final and Complete,"142 Part III: Analyzing Contract Terms and Their Meaning \n ✓ The promise was made before signing.  If a party made a certain prom -\nise before signing, you may be looking at a parol evidence rule issue. If \nthe promise was made after signing, you’re dealing with a modification.\n ✓ The promise and the bargained-for consideration are not part of a \nseparate agreement. A party may offer consideration in exchange for \nseveral promises from the other party. If the consideration in the writing \nis what the party offered in exchange for the alleged promise, then you \nmay be looking at a parol evidence issue. If the other party offered sepa -\nrate consideration for the alleged promise, then you’re looking at two \nseparate contracts, and the parol evidence rule doesn’t apply.\n For example, suppose the buyer claims, “Just before we signed the agreement, \nthe seller promised he would remove the ugly ice house across the street.” \nThis evidence fulfills the first condition because the promise was made before  \nsigning. Now you must determine whether the bargained-for consideration for \nthat promise is found in the written agreement or in a separate agreement:\n ✓ Written agreement:  The buyer may claim that he promised to pay a sum \nof money in exchange for the seller’s promises to (1) sell the house and \n(2) tear down the ice house. This claim is perfectly legitimate if the seller’s \ntwo promises are both part of the agreement.  If they’re both part of the \nagreement, then the bargained-for consideration (the sum of money the \nbuyer offered) presented in the written contract applies to both promises \nby the seller. Now you have a true parol rule evidence problem.\n ✓ Separate agreement:  If the buyer promised the seller something specific \nin exchange for that particular promise (for example, offering the seller \n$50 in exchange for tearing down the ice house), then you’re dealing \nwith two separate contracts: a written contract for the sale of the house \nfor a sum of money and an oral contract to tear down an ice house for \n$50. The statute of frauds (see Chapter 8) requires the first contract to \nbe in writing because it’s a real estate transaction, but it doesn’t require \nthe second contract to be in writing. Evidence of the oral contract is \nadmissible, and the parol evidence rule doesn’t apply in this case.\nAssuming that the promise meets both conditions, you’re looking at a true \nparol rule evidence problem. You can now use the parol evidence rule to \ndetermine whether the term is part of the agreement.\nDeciding Whether the Agreement  \nIs Final and Complete\nAfter a party presents parol evidence, offers that evidence for the purpose \nof adding a term to the agreement, and can’t prove that the term is part of \na separate enforceable agreement, the next step is to decide whether the \n143  Chapter 9: Evaluating Unwritten Terms with the Parol Evidence Rule\nparties intended the written agreement to be final and complete. This is the \nhardest part of the rule because you need to assess the parties’ intent.\n The parol evidence rule directs the court to refuse to admit evidence “once the \nparties have reduced their agreement to a writing that they intend to contain the \nfinal and complete statement of their agreement. ” If the parties didn’t consider \nthe written contract final or complete, then the court is free to admit evidence \nof terms that would supplement the contract. So determining whether the par -\nties intended the written agreement to be final and complete is a crucial step.\nRecognizing the difference between  \nsubjective and objective intent\nCourts draw a distinction between two types of intent:\n ✓ Subjective intent:  Subjective intent is what’s in each party’s mind. \nDetermining subjective intent may require having a trial and taking  \neach party’s testimony.\n ✓ Objective intent:  Objective intent is what a reasonable person would’ve \nintended. A judge can determine objective intent without hearing the \nparties’ testimony.\nWhen deciding whether the parties intended their entire agreement to be \nfound in the writing, authorities are divided into two camps. In the subjec -\ntive camp are Arthur Corbin and the Restatement, which are interested in \nwhat the parties actually intended. In the objective camp are authorities like \nSamuel Williston and many modern courts, which are interested in what rea -\nsonable parties would’ve intended. Note that one advantage of the objective \napproach is judicial efficiency: A court can make this determination more \nefficiently if it doesn’t have to hear from the parties. (For info on Corbin, \nWilliston, and other major players in contract law, see Chapter 22.)\n In Mitchill,  authorities favoring the objective view wouldn’t ask Mitchill and \nLath what they’d intended. Instead, these authorities would ask whether rea -\nsonable parties in that situation would’ve put this understanding in the writ -\ning. Mitchill  was decided on summary judgment without the need for a trial. \nThe majority ruled that because it was a contract for the sale of real estate, \nreasonable parties would’ve included every detail of the sale, including the \npromise to remove the ice house, in the written contract.\nFiguring out whether the agreement is final\nTo determine whether the parties intended the agreement to be final, exam -\nine the negotiation process. If the parties kicked several drafts back and forth \n144 Part III: Analyzing Contract Terms and Their Meaning \nbefore signing a final draft, that’s a pretty good indication that they intended \nthe signed agreement to be final.\n Think of the parol evidence rule as the “prior negotiation” rule. As parties \nhammer out the terms of the agreement, they may discuss numerous different \nterms. Signing of the agreement signals an end to negotiations and the parties’ \nfinal agreement to those terms. As soon as the parties sign off on the agree -\nment, it’s considered final for purposes of the parol evidence rule.\nChecking whether the agreement  \nis complete\nA writing is complete  if all the terms the parties agreed to are found in the \nwriting. You can determine whether the parties intended the written contract \nto be complete in a few ways.\n ✓ Look for a merger clause in the contract stating that the contract is  \ncomplete. I discuss this clause in the next section.\n ✓ Look for a written agreement that appears to be very comprehensive \nand detailed.\n ✓ Look for a type of contract where all the terms would normally be \nincluded in the final writing. For example, a separation agreement \nbetween husband and wife should be complete because it’s intended  \nto wrap up all the loose ends of their relationship.\n An agreement that’s partly written and partly oral is fine unless  the parties \nintended the written contract to be not only the final statement of their \nagreement but also the complete statement of their agreement. (A writing that \nthe parties intended to be complete is often referred to as an integrated agree -\nment  — all the terms are integrated or merged in the writing.)\nIn Mitchill v. Lath,  the majority said,  Look, this is a real estate deal involving a \nlot of money. When reasonable people make such an agreement, they put all the \nterms they agreed to in the writing. Notice that this reasoning references objec -\ntive intent; nobody asked the buyer or seller what they actually intended — \nwhat matters to the court is what reasonable parties would’ve intended.\nThe dissent made a good point, however: The ice house was not on the land that \nwas being purchased but on land located across the street. Therefore, reason -\nable people might put all their understandings with respect to the land being \nsold in the writing but put their other understandings in an oral agreement.",7880
53-Considering Evidence That Supplements or Contradicts the Agreement.pdf,53-Considering Evidence That Supplements or Contradicts the Agreement,"145  Chapter 9: Evaluating Unwritten Terms with the Parol Evidence Rule\nDealing with a merger clause that says \nthe contract is final and complete\nBecause the outcome of a parol evidence rule issue depends on intention, \na drafter often states that intention in the agreement by including a merger \nclause,  such as the following:\nThis writing constitutes a final written expression of the terms of this \nagreement and is a complete and exclusive statement of those terms.\nMost courts find that although the merger clause may offer some evidence of \nthe parties’ intentions, it’s not conclusive.\n How much weight the court is likely to give a merger clause often hinges on \nthe type of contract:\n ✓ More weight in a negotiated contract:  The negotiated contract  comes \nabout when the parties bang their heads together to work out the terms. \nOne party may draft a proposed contract that proceeds through a series \nof revisions. Finally, both parties sign it. This act indicates that they’ve \nfinished their negotiations and reached an agreement that they can both \nlive with and, more important, intend to be final and complete.\n ✓ Less weight in a contract of adhesion:  The contract of adhesion  results \nwhen the more powerful of two parties presents its boilerplate contract \nand the other party agrees to it, sometimes by signing, sometimes by an \nact such as clicking a button on a web page or tearing the shrink wrap \noff a package. The merger clause is usually at the end of a boilerplate \ncontract that consumers probably aren’t going to read, so it doesn’t \nindicate much about the parties’ intentions. (See Chapter 6 for more \nabout contracts of adhesion.)\nEven if the agreement lacks a merger clause, a court can still find that the \nparties intended it to be final and complete. For example, a court may recog -\nnize a detailed contract in an area where the purpose of the agreement is to \nwrap up all the details of the transaction as a final and complete contract.\nConsidering Evidence That Supplements \nor Contradicts the Agreement\nIf a court decides that the writing is final but not complete (only partially \nintegrated ), the court admits parol evidence to supplement the contract but \n146 Part III: Analyzing Contract Terms and Their Meaning \nnot to contradict it. A court is not about to step in and undo what the parties \nagreed to in writing. In a parol evidence rule issue, the court looks for evi -\ndence to prove that something not in the written contract needs to be added.\n For example, suppose that the written agreement in Mitchill  set a closing date \nof March 1. Just before the parties signed the agreement, they orally agreed to \nchange the closing date to April 1 and that the seller would tear down the ice \nhouse across the street. If the court found that the writing was only a partial \nintegration of the parties’ agreement, the court would admit evidence of one \nof these oral agreements but not the other:\n ✓ Not admissible:  Evidence of the closing date, because that evidence con-\ntradicts  a term in the written contract — the oral agreement of the April \n1 date contradicts the written agreement of the March 1 date.\n ✓ Admissible:  Evidence of the promise to remove the ice house, because \nthat evidence supplements  the agreement — it adds a term not in the \nwritten agreement.\n Just because a court admits evidence for the purpose of adding a term to the \ncontract, that doesn’t mean the term automatically becomes part of the con -\ntract. The parol evidence rule is intended to determine whether evidence may \nbe admitted to supplement the written contract as a matter of law.  A jury still \nhas to decide as a matter of fact  whether the evidence presented proves that \nthe parties really agreed to that term. A party objecting to the admissibility \nof the evidence is perfectly free to say something like, “Yes, I said that, but I \nsaid a lot of other things that didn’t end up in the agreement. The terms we \nintended to make part of our agreement we wrote down and signed.”\n Here’s how these decisions concerning parol evidence could’ve played out in \nMitchill v. Lath:\n ✓ Matter of law:  The court first decides whether the writing is complete as \na matter of law:\n  • Complete integration:  If the court decides that the writing is a \ncomplete integration of the parties’ written agreement, it won’t \nadmit evidence that supplements or contradicts the writing.\n  • Partial integration:  If the court decides that the writing is only a \npartial integration, then the court would admit evidence that sup -\nplements the written contract but not evidence that contradicts it.\n ✓ Matter of fact:  If the court decides to admit evidence that supplements \nthe partially integrated contract, then the jury or the judge (in a case \nheard without a jury) would decide as a matter of fact whether the par -\nties had in fact made that oral agreement. So even if the court admits the \nbuyer’s testimony that the seller promised to tear down the ice house, \nthe finder of fact could determine that the seller had said no such thing.",5148
54-Contrasting the Common Law with the UCC Parol Evidence Rule.pdf,54-Contrasting the Common Law with the UCC Parol Evidence Rule,"147  Chapter 9: Evaluating Unwritten Terms with the Parol Evidence Rule\nContrasting the Common Law with  \nthe UCC Parol Evidence Rule\nThe UCC parol evidence rule is very similar to the common-law rule. \nHowever, the UCC rule provides a few exceptions in which evidence that \nsupplements a complete and final writing is admissible.\nAs enacted in North Carolina at 25-2-202, the UCC parol evidence rule  \nprovides the following:\n  § 25-2-202. Final written expression; parol or extrinsic evidence.\n  Terms with respect to which the confirmatory memoranda of the parties \nagree or which are otherwise set forth in a writing intended by the parties \nas a final expression of their agreement with respect to such terms as are \nincluded therein may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior agree -\nment or of a contemporaneous oral agreement but may be explained  \nor supplemented\n  (a) by course of dealing or usage of trade or by course of perfor -\nmance; and\n  (b) by evidence of consistent additional terms unless the court \nfinds the writing to have been intended also as a complete and \nexclusive statement of the terms of the agreement.\nThe first paragraph states that if the parties intended the writing to be a “final \nexpression of their agreement,” then the evidence may not contradict a term \nin the writing. Subsection (b) states that the writing can be supplemented by \nadditional terms unless the writing is intended to be complete and exclusive. In \nother words, if the written contract is fully integrated, it can’t be supplemented \nor contradicted.\nSubsection (a), however, adds something to the common-law rule: It states \nthat even if it the writing is final, it can be explained or supplemented “by \ncourse of dealing or usage of trade or by course of performance.” (See \nChapters 10 and 11 for more about these important aspects of commercial \nlaw.) Note that the language from subsection (b) — “unless the court finds \nthe writing to have been intended also as a complete and exclusive statement \nof the terms of the agreement” — doesn’t apply to subsection (a). So even if \nthe parties intended the writing to be a final and complete agreement, evi -\ndence of the following is admissible to supplement or explain the writing:\n ✓ Course of dealing\n ✓ Usage of trade\n ✓ Course of performance\n148 Part III: Analyzing Contract Terms and Their Meaning \n For example, assume that a seller sells a widget to a buyer. The parties sign a \nfully integrated writing that states that the sale price is $1,000 payable 30 days \nafter delivery. Seven days after delivery, the buyer sends the seller $950 in full \npayment for the widget. The seller claims breach, but the buyer offers evi -\ndence that in all the other contracts the parties had agreed to, they had an \nunderstanding that paying within ten days earned the buyer a 5 percent dis -\ncount. The seller says, “I don’t see that in the writing.” The buyer says, “This  \nis evidence of a course of dealing (what we did under previous contracts \nbetween us) that is admissible even though the writing is fully integrated.”\nYou may think that the buyer’s evidence contradicts the writing because the \nwriting says that the price of the widget is $1,000, not $950. Most authorities, \nhowever, say that the question of contradiction doesn’t turn on whether the \noffered term directly negates what’s in the contract but on whether it can \nlive in harmony with what’s in the contract. In other words, if the contract \nincluded a term that said “5 percent discount for payment within ten days,” \nwould that contradict the term that states the price of the widget? Most \nauthorities would say no. The additional term could live in harmony with  \nthe $1,000 price term, so it doesn’t contradict.Finding an exception in international contracts\nWhen drafting an international contract \nfor the sale of goods, many U.S. companies \ninclude a choice-of-law clause  providing \nthat the UCC of a particular state governs the \nagreement. If they don’t do this and both par -\nties’ countries have signed the United Nations \nConvention on Contracts for the International \nSale of Goods (UNCISG), then the contract is \ngoverned by the UNCISG.\nThe CISG doesn’t have a parol evidence rule. \nArticle 8(1) of the CISG instructs courts to inter -\npret the “statements [. . .] and other conduct of \na party [. . .] according to his intent” as long as \nthe other party “knew or could not have been \nunaware” of that intent. The language of the \nConvention, therefore, makes it a question of \nfact whether an understanding was reached \nthat didn’t end up in the writing.In one case, an American company purchased \nmarble from an Italian company. The buyer \ncomplained about the quality of the marble, \nbut the seller defended on the grounds that \nthe buyer hadn’t complied with the method for \nmaking complaints stated on the back of the \nform the parties had signed. The buyer claimed \nthat before they signed the agreement, the \nparties had agreed that the terms written on \nthe back of the form wouldn’t be part of their \nagreement.\nIf the UCC governed, the buyer would’ve been \nlaughed out of court. But the court found that \nunder the CISG, if the seller was aware of the \nbuyer’s intent not to be bound by those terms, \nthen that evidence would be admissible under \nArticle 8(1).",5411

57-Finding the Terms of an Incomplete Contract.pdf,57-Finding the Terms of an Incomplete Contract,"Chapter 10\nFinding Unwritten Terms That \nComplete the Contract\nIn This Chapter\n▶ Understanding how contract law fills gaps in contracts\n▶ Ensuring that parties act in good faith — honestly and reasonably\n▶ Recognizing default rules and using freedom of contract to override them\n▶ Understanding express and implied warranties\n▶ Shifting and limiting risk with warranty disclaimers\nE \nven if the parties believe they’ve formed a contract that’s final and  \ncomplete, their contract has gaps where the parties either assumed  \nthat they were in agreement or failed to foresee an issue that arose only \nduring performance.\nTo fill many of these gaps, contract law supplies terms. Some of those terms \nare based on what contract law concludes reasonable parties would’ve agreed \nto; some are based on the parties’ previous experience, as determined by their \ncourse of dealing; and others are based on rules, such as implied warranties.\nWhen drafting contracts for your clients or evaluating contracts in dispute, \nyou need to be aware of the terms implied in a contract and how the courts \nuse these terms and other approaches to fill the gaps and resolve disputes, \nas this chapter explains.\nFinding the Terms of an  \nIncomplete Contract\nOne of the jobs of contract law is to find the terms of a contract. A good \nstarting point is the terms the parties expressly agreed to in writing. The \nparol evidence rule (see Chapter 9) can help determine whether a contract \ncontains additional terms, either in speech or in writing. Even after the court \n152 Part III: Analyzing Contract Terms and Their Meaning \nidentifies the terms that the parties expressly agreed to, however, the con -\ntract may still be incomplete. The contract may also include terms that the \nlaw supplies when the parties don’t expressly include them in the contract. \nIn other words, if the drafter didn’t include a particular term in the contract, \nthe law may supply it.\nIn this way, a contract differs from other types of documents, such as books \nand newspapers. If a mystery writer omits a passage that’s essential for the \nreader to solve the mystery, no mystery novel law tells the reader what to \nplug in. With contracts, however, the law is often able to supply a term that’s \nmissing from the contract.\nFurthermore, contract performance generally takes place in the future, and \nno one can foresee everything that might happen. If, somewhere down the \nline, the parties need to deal with an unforeseen issue, they’re free to come \nup with a term on their own. If they can’t do it themselves, contract law does \nit for them.\n Terminology used to describe the gap-filling process varies. Some refer to it \nas adding implied terms,  but that’s not very accurate because contracts often \ncontain nothing that implies a certain missing term. Others refer to gap-fillers \nas constructive terms,  indicating more accurately that the court constructs \nsomething where there’s nothing. I generally refer to the court’s supplying  \nterms, but contract law often calls these terms implied  terms. Whatever you \ncall them, this section describes the process that contract law uses to fill \nthese gaps.\nUsing contract rules to fill the gaps\nWhen a court needs to fill a gap, it goes to a contract rule. Typically, the rule \ntells the court to determine the term that reasonable parties in the shoes of \nthe parties to the contract would’ve agreed to if they had thought about it.\nThe court follows the same approach when a contract doesn’t address a \nfuture event. For example, if an unforeseen event prevents a party from hon -\noring his end of the bargain, contract law determines whether the party’s \nnonperformance is excused. It does so by asking under what circumstances \nreasonable parties would’ve decided to excuse nonperformance if they’d \nthought about it when drafting their contract. I discuss excuses for nonper -\nformance in Chapter 13.\nThe UCC provides a number of devices available to plug the gaps and enforce \ncontracts for the sale of goods. What the courts typically do in such cases is \nfall back on what’s considered reasonable:\n153  Chapter 10: Finding Unwritten Terms That Complete the Contract\n ✓ Price:  The price must be reasonable.\n ✓ Time of delivery:  The item must be delivered in a reasonable  amount  \nof time. The courts may look at what’s customary.\n ✓ Location:  The item must be delivered at the seller’s place of business  \nor residence, which is the usual practice.\n ✓ Order of the exchange:  The parties must make the exchange  \nsimultaneously.\n ✓ Quality:  The quality of the promised item is determined by warranty law \n(as I explain in the later section “Protecting Buyers through Warranties”).\n The reasonable terms are exclusively for plugging gaps when the parties failed \nto agree on a term. For example, if I agree to sell you my $10,000 car for $5,000, I \ncouldn’t complain that I should be able to avoid the contract because the price \nwas not reasonable. The price only has to be reasonable, according to UCC § \n2-305, when the contract fails to specify a price. In that event, the court may \nconsult the Kelley Blue Book to determine the car’s reasonable market value.\n Suppose I offer to sell you my pen, and you agree to buy it. We each commit -\nted to do something, but we omitted numerous details, including price, time of \ndelivery, destination, who goes first, and the pen’s condition. Using the list of \ngap-fillers, the courts can fill in the blanks and enforce the contract according \nto those terms.\nOne gap the court usually can’t fill in is the quantity term. If I agree to sell you \npens and then I refuse to perform, filling the gap isn’t possible, because the \ncourt has no way of knowing with any certainty how many pens I promised to \nsell you. The court may be able to establish a reasonable quantity based on \neither of the following:\n ✓ Course of dealing:  The court may look at quantities specified in previ -\nous contracts between the two parties. In this case, the court looks at the \nnumber of pens I sold you under previous contracts. For example, if for \neach of the preceding three years, I had sold you ten pens, the court could \nreasonably conclude that I was agreeing to sell you ten pens this time, too.\n ✓ Seller output or buyer requirements:  Even though no specific quantity \nis stated, the parties may measure the quantity in terms of output or \nrequirements, as I explain in Chapter 3.\nUnderstanding types of gap-filling rules\nContract law uses two varieties of rules to fill gaps in contracts:",6648
58-Reading In the Duty of Good Faith.pdf,58-Reading In the Duty of Good Faith,"154 Part III: Analyzing Contract Terms and Their Meaning \n ✓ Default rules:  These terms are supplied unless the parties contract \naround them. Think of them as the default settings in your word-  \nprocessing program; unless you change a particular setting, the program \nuses the default. Examples of default rules include the price gap-filler — \nif the parties don’t specify a price, the default rule sets a price at what’s \nconsidered “reasonable.”\n ✓ Immutable rules:  These terms are always supplied and the parties are \nnot free to change them. A good example is the covenant of good faith \nand fair dealing, which I discuss later in this chapter in the next section.\n Although parties are free, within certain limits, to change the terms of default \nrules, they’re not free to change the immutable rules, which include the rules \nof contract law — including offer, acceptance, and consideration — that deter -\nmine whether parties have a contract.\nReading In the Duty of Good Faith\nOne of the terms that the law supplies in every contract is the duty of good \nfaith. This is an immutable rule that the parties aren’t allowed to disclaim. \nBoth the UCC and the Restatement state that every contract contains a  \nduty of good faith:\n ✓ UCC:  The UCC contains a definition of good faith. Section 1-201(b)(20), as \nenacted in North Carolina at 25-1-201(b)(20), provides that “Good faith, \nexcept as otherwise provided in Article 5 of this Chapter, means honesty \nin fact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair \ndealing.” This definition specifies two requirements of good faith — the \nobjective and subjective standards — as I discuss in this section.\n ✓ Restatement:  The Restatement is more vague. It doesn’t define “good \nfaith,” leaving the courts to decide what it means in different contexts. \nSome of the situations identified in the Comment to Restatement § 205, \nwhere courts have found bad faith, involve “evasion of the spirit of the \nbargain, lack of diligence and slacking off, willful rendering of imperfect \nperformance, abuse of a power to specify terms, and interference with \nor failure to cooperate in the other party’s performance.”\n Under the UCC, good faith requires that a person both be honest and observe \nreasonable standards; failing to live up to either of those standards shows a \nlack of good faith.\n155  Chapter 10: Finding Unwritten Terms That Complete the Contract\nBeing honest: The subjective  \nduty of good faith\nSubjective good faith  requires “honesty in fact.” This makes sense, because if \nyou’re being dishonest, you’re probably not acting in good faith. Proving that \na person is in fact dishonest, however, may be difficult. To do so, you need \nevidence that proves the person had ulterior motives for her actions.\n Assume, for example, that a buyer orders widgets to be delivered by noon \non the 28th. The widgets arrive a half-hour late, and the buyer rejects them. \nUnless stated otherwise by the parties or the circumstances, the time of deliv -\nery is merely an immaterial breach, and the buyer should be able to recover \ndamages in the unlikely event that the slight delay resulted in damages (see \nChapter 14 for info on material and immaterial breaches). But according to \nthe “perfect tender rule” of UCC § 2-601, a buyer may reject goods if the tender \nfails in any respect  to conform to the contract. Here, although the tender did \nnot conform, the buyer must still act in good faith. Did it honestly reject the \nwidgets because they were delivered a half-hour late, or did the buyer have \nsome other motive, such as a decline in the market price so it could obtain \ncheaper widgets elsewhere? To prove that the rejection was in bad faith, the \nseller would have to prove the buyer’s motive, which isn’t easy.\nFurthermore, proving a breach of good faith probably isn’t worth the trouble, \nbecause such a breach is just an ordinary breach of contract — nothing \nterrible happens to the person who failed to act in good faith. Courts don’t \ngenerally award punitive damages for breach of contract. If the seller proves \nthat the buyer failed to act in good faith, the seller gets the same damages for \nbreach of contract as if the buyer had acted in good faith.\n Some courts may award punitive damages in cases in which an insurance com -\npany acts in bad faith, knowing it should pay a claim but disputing that claim.\nBeing reasonable: The objective  \nduty of good faith\nObjective good faith  is the duty to observe reasonable commercial standards \nof fair dealing. This concept is consistent with Code jurisprudence, which \nseems to think people in a particular business adhere to certain identifiable \nstandards. If that’s the case, then testimony from someone in that business \ncould be proof of those standards.\n156 Part III: Analyzing Contract Terms and Their Meaning \nIn the case of a buyer who rejects widgets because they’re delivered half an \nhour late, the buyer may have had a good reason to reject the goods. If he \ndidn’t, the seller could use another person in the widget business as a wit -\nness and ask, “Is it reasonable for a person in this business to reject a ship -\nment of widgets just because they’re delivered a half-hour late?” If the answer \nto that question is no, then the seller has gone a long way toward establish -\ning that the buyer didn’t act in good faith.\n Good faith requires that a person be both honest and observe reasonable stan -\ndards. The case of Neumiller Farms, Inc. v. Cornett provides a good example of \nhow each of these standards can be proven. Cornett was a potato farmer who \nagreed to sell potatoes to Neumiller for $4.25 per hundredweight. The contract \nrequired potatoes that “chipt to buyer satisfaction”; in other words, these pota -\ntoes had to be suitable to make potato chips. After Neumiller rejected Cornett’s \npotatoes, Cornett had them tested by an expert from the county Cooperative \nExtension Service, who reported that the potatoes were suitable. Furthermore, \nNeumiller bought potatoes from another grower for $2.00; but when Cornett \ntendered the same potatoes for the contract price of $4.25, Neumiller rejected \nthem. These facts show that Neumiller wasn’t acting in good faith according  \nto the objective standard,  because a reasonable person would’ve found the  \npotatoes satisfactory.\nCornett also proved that when he tried to tender potatoes under the contract, \nthe buyer told him, “I’m not going to accept any more of your potatoes. . . . \nI can buy potatoes all day for $2.00.” This fact shows that Neumiller wasn’t \nacting in good faith according to the subjective standard,  because he was being \ndishonest — his real motive in rejecting the potatoes was the price he would \nhave to pay for them, not their quality.\nUsing freedom of contract to refine  \nthe definition of good faith\nNot surprisingly, you don’t have freedom of contract to get out of the obliga -\ntion of good faith. The UCC states this limitation on freedom of contract in  \n§ 1-302(b). As enacted in North Carolina, it provides in part:\nThe obligations of good faith, diligence, reasonableness, and care pre -\nscribed by [the Uniform Commercial Code] may not be disclaimed by \nagreement. The parties, by agreement, may determine the standards by \nwhich the performance of those obligations is to be measured if those \nstandards are not manifestly unreasonable.\nThe first sentence of this provision states that, in addition to good faith, you \ncan’t disclaim the duties of “diligence, reasonableness, and care.” Notice,",7654
59-Working with and around the Default Rules.pdf,59-Working with and around the Default Rules,"157  Chapter 10: Finding Unwritten Terms That Complete the Contract\nhowever, that the second sentence says that you may define them if you use \nstandards that are not “manifestly unreasonable.” For example, your con -\ntract can’t say, “Buyer does not have to be reasonable in deciding whether to \naccept the goods after inspection.” But it can say, “Buyer is acting reasonably \nin deciding whether to accept goods after inspection if more than 5 percent \nof the goods do not meet Industry Standard 5.0.”\nWorking with and around  \nthe Default Rules\nWhether you’re drafting contracts, preparing a contract defense, or trying to \nprove the enforceability of certain terms omitted from the contract, you need \nto be able to identify any default rule that applies and understand how the \nparties can substitute their own rules.\nThis section tells you where to look for and how to identify the default rules \nand explains how the parties to an agreement can use freedom of contract to \noverride the default terms and make strategic changes to shift the risk to the \nother party.\nRecognizing default rules  \nwhen you see them\nTo determine the default rule for a certain issue, consult the usual sources: \nfederal and state statutes, including the UCC in a contract involving the sale \nof goods, and the common law, which you can find in general terms in the \nRestatement of Contracts. The hard part is determining whether the rule is \na default rule or an immutable rule, because the rules don’t come with flags \nattached telling you which is which.\n In the UCC, look for the words “unless otherwise agreed” or some other indi -\ncation that the parties are free to override the rule. This phrase tells you that \nunless the parties include a term that addresses this particular issue, then the \nCode supplies a default rule. However, the Code also says in § 1-302(c) that \n“The presence in certain provisions of the UCC of the phrase ‘unless other -\nwise agreed’ . . . does not imply that the effect of other provisions may not be \nvaried by agreement.” In other words, if the Code says that you can otherwise \nagree, then you can, but if it doesn’t say that, then you still might be able to \notherwise agree!\n158 Part III: Analyzing Contract Terms and Their Meaning \nUsing freedom of contract to change  \nthe rules and shift the risk\nFreedom of contract (see Chapter 4) gives everyone of legal age and ability \nthe freedom to bargain fairly for contracts allowable by law. Within certain \nlimits, this freedom extends to setting terms in the contract that override  \nthe default rules.\n For example, by default, the UCC in § 2-314(1) states that a merchant seller \ngives the buyer a warranty of merchantability — a promise that the goods will \ndo what they’re supposed to do. As a buyer, then, you don’t have to bargain to \nget a promise from the seller that when you bring that new refrigerator home, \nit’ll work. Contract law already supplied that promise. However, merchants are \nfree to sell products without that warranty as long as they override the default \nrule by adding clear and conspicuous language to the contract. (For more about \nwarranties, see “Protecting Buyers through Warranties,” later in this chapter.)\n When negotiating contracts, look for opportunities to use freedom of con -\ntract to shift the risk to the other party. If you’re representing the seller, for \nexample, you may want to shift the risk of loss of goods to the buyer. If you’re \nrepresenting the buyer who carries the risk that the price of goods will fall \nafter the contract is signed, you may want to shift that risk to the seller. That’s \nall part of negotiating.\n A seller in Salem, North Carolina, agrees to sell goods to a buyer in Boston, \nMassachusetts. The default rule that governs the place of delivery of the \ngoods is supplied by UCC § 2-308(a). As codified in North Carolina, it provides:\nUnless otherwise agreed . . . the place for delivery of goods is the seller’s \nplace of business.\nThis is bad news for the buyer — all the seller has to do is have the goods \nready at his place of business for the buyer to pick up. The buyer wants to \nchange that. Note that the statute contains the words “unless otherwise \nagreed,” which is a signal that this is a default rule the parties are free to \nchange. Knowing the default rule and taking advantage of that freedom of \ncontract provision, the buyer may suggest a provision something like this:\nThe seller shall deliver the goods to the buyer at buyer’s address in \nBoston at seller’s sole expense.\nThe seller may not agree to that and may suggest a compromise:\nThe seller shall deliver the goods to UPS for shipment to the buyer at the \nbuyer’s expense.\nThe next section provides a closer look at how risk-shifting plays out in the \nlaw of warranty.",4866
60-Protecting Buyers through Warranties.pdf,60-Protecting Buyers through Warranties,"159  Chapter 10: Finding Unwritten Terms That Complete the Contract\nProtecting Buyers through Warranties\nSometimes contracts contain detailed terms regarding the quality of the per -\nformance the buyer has contracted to receive. But more often, the contract \nis silent on this question, so the law must supply a term to specify the quality \nthe buyer is entitled to. In contracts for services, such as construction con -\ntracts, the court usually reads in that the contractor must provide something \nlike “workmanlike performance.” This standard is similar to the tort standard \nof performance: You’re entitled to the quality you can reasonably expect \nfrom a person in a similar business in your community. With the purchase of \na new home from a builder, in most jurisdictions you get an implied warranty \nof habitability  — a promise that the home is fit to live in.\nUnder Article 2 of the UCC, the quality terms for the sale of goods are spelled \nout by using warranties, including the following:\n ✓ Express warranty\n ✓ Warranty of title and against infringement\n ✓ Warranty of merchantability\n ✓ Warranty of fitness for a particular purpose\nThis section describes each of these warranties and how the courts are likely \nto read them into a contract.\nMaking express warranties\nAs defined in UCC § 2-313, an express warranty  is “an affirmation of fact or \npromise made by the seller to the buyer which relates to the goods and \nbecomes part of the basis of the bargain.” The two key phrases here are \n“affirmation of fact or promise” and “basis of the bargain.”\nAn affirmation of fact or promise  is a statement that can be proven in fact or \nsomething the seller promised. If a car dealer sells you a 2003 Ford Windstar, \nthen the express warranty is that Ford made the car and it’s a Windstar 2003 \nmodel. Contract law is more accustomed to warranties that don’t just affirm \nfacts but make a promise, such as, “If anything goes wrong with this car \nduring the next 12 months or 10,000 miles, whichever comes first, we’ll repair \nor replace the defective part.” Statements that are puffing or opinion like \n“This car will run like a dream” or “You won’t find a better deal anywhere in \ntown” probably don’t cut it.\nNot everyone agrees what basis of the bargain  means when the Code says \nthat the warranty must become a part of the basis of the bargain. Here are \ntwo interpretations:\n160 Part III: Analyzing Contract Terms and Their Meaning \n ✓ One understanding is that the buyer relied on the warranty as part of \nthe deal. Under this theory, if the buyer knew he was getting something \ndifferent from what the seller expressly promised, then the buyer didn’t \nget the warranty. For example, assume that you looked at the vehicle the \nseller was selling as a 2003 Ford Windstar, and you knew it was a 2002 \nmodel. The seller could claim that you didn’t get that warranty because \nyou didn’t rely on the statement when you made the purchase.\n ✓ Another understanding is that whether the warranty is part of the basis \nof the bargain is a matter of timing. Under this theory, specifying that \nthe warranty must be part of the basis of the bargain eliminates state -\nments that didn’t make it into the final contract based on the parol \nevidence rule (which I discuss in Chapter 9). For example, if just before \nI sell you my used refrigerator, I tell you, “I promise it will work for 30 \ndays,” that’s an express warranty. But if we then sign a writing that \ncontains the final and complete statement of our agreement, the parol \nevidence rule will probably say that that promise isn’t part of our agree -\nment. Some argue that the warranty is not part of the basis of the bar -\ngain if it comes later, like when you buy a TV and later open up the box \nand find a warranty inside.\n With the sale of goods, look for any affirmation of fact or promise, and you’ll find \nan express warranty. That’s why you see all that fine print in ads on TV — the \nseller is trying to tell you that it’s not making any affirmations of fact or promises!\nLooking for an implied warranty of title  \nor warranty against infringement\nWhen someone transfers ownership of goods, such as a car or an electronics \ngadget, the transfer typically carries some implied warranties:\n ✓ An implied warranty that the seller owns the item\n ✓ An implied warranty against infringement of intellectual property  \nrights in it\nYou don’t see these warranties in the contract — the law supplies them  \nby default.\nThe implied warranty of title, under § 2-312(1) of the Code, gives the buyer \nof goods a claim for damages for breach of contract if the seller doesn’t in \nfact own the goods or have the right to transfer them. Furthermore, this war -\nranty covers liens and encumbrances that cloud the title. For example, if a \nlender has a lien against property, that lender may have the right to take the \nproperty even from someone who bought it without knowing about the lien. \nHowever, the implied warranty of good title would give the ill-informed buyer \na claim against the seller for breach of that warranty.\n161  Chapter 10: Finding Unwritten Terms That Complete the Contract\nThe implied warranty of infringement, under § 2-312(2) of the Code, applies \nto intellectual property, including software, inventions, literary and artistic \nworks, and designs used in commerce. Unless otherwise specified in the con -\ntract, the seller warrants that the goods are delivered free of the intellectual \nproperty infringement claims of third parties. This warranty is becoming \nincreasingly important as more “smart goods” that contain computer chips \nenter the market.\n Suppose Developer A sells the architecture for a new cellular device to \nXphones, Xphones sells the device to your local electronics store, which sells \nit to you. At each point in the distribution chain, the seller warrants the prod -\nuct against infringement to the buyer. If Developer B, who actually invented \nthe architecture, wins an infringement claim against Developer A that results \nin your cellular device not working, each buyer has a claim for breach of \nwarranty against the party higher in the distribution chain: You have a claim \nagainst your local electronics store, which has a claim against Xphones, which \nhas a claim against Developer A, who’s ultimately the responsible party.\nChecking for an implied warranty  \nof merchantability\nWhen merchants who deal with a certain kind of product sell products of that \nkind, they give buyers the implied warranty of merchantability. You don’t \nsee the implied warranty in a contract, because the law supplies it by default. \nAlthough UCC § 2-314 provides a number of definitions of merchantability,  the \ndefinition the courts most commonly apply is that the goods “are fit for the \nordinary purposes for which such goods are used.” In other words, the thing \ndoes what it’s supposed to do.\n The implied warranty of merchantability applies only to merchants who sell \na particular kind of good. If a car dealer sells you a car, he’s giving you an \nimplied warranty that the car is fit for the ordinary purposes for which cars \nare used. On the other hand, if I, a law professor, sell you a car, you don’t get \nthat warranty, because I don’t deal in cars.\nYou may wonder whether this implied warranty of merchantability applies to \nused-car dealers. The answer is yes and no:\n ✓ Yes, because used-car dealers are merchants who deal in cars.  \nHowever, they’re promising you only that the car is fit for the ordinary \npurposes of this particular kind of car. If you buy a car with 100,000 \nmiles on it, they’re warranting only that it’s as fit as a car with 100,000 \nmiles on it. If the transmission fails, you’d have to prove that the ordi -\nnary transmission should last longer than that.",7900
61-Shifting the Risk by Disclaiming or Limiting Warranties.pdf,61-Shifting the Risk by Disclaiming or Limiting Warranties,"162 Part III: Analyzing Contract Terms and Their Meaning \n ✓ No, because the implied warranty is merely a default rule.  If the used-\ncar dealer slaps a sticker on the car that clearly communicates to buyers \nthat this car is offered “AS IS,” then that term overrides the implied war -\nranty. (See the later section “Shifting the Risk by Disclaiming or Limiting \nWarranties” for more about warranty disclaimers.)\nSeeking out an implied warranty of  \nfitness for a particular purpose\nAlthough the implied warranty of merchantability (see the preceding section) \nwarrants that goods are fit for their ordinary purpose, it doesn’t warrant that \nthose goods are fit for any special purpose. To fill this gap, UCC § 2-315  \nprovides an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose.  Any seller,  \nnot just a merchant, can give this warranty, but it applies only under the  \nfollowing conditions:\n ✓ The buyer informs the seller about the special purpose the goods are  \nto be used for.\n ✓ The seller selects goods that are supposedly suitable for the buyer’s \nstated purpose.\n For example, if you enter a sporting goods store and say, “I need footwear to \nclimb Mt. Everest,” and the clerk hands you a pair of hiking boots, then the \nmerchant is promising more than footwear fit for the ordinary purpose of out -\ndoor wear. He’s promising that the boots are fit for the particular purpose you \nspecified — climbing Mt. Everest.\nShifting the Risk by Disclaiming  \nor Limiting Warranties\nThe general rule of warranties is this:\nWhat the bold print giveth, the fine print taketh away.\nWell, that’s a bit of an exaggeration, because the UCC requires more than \nfine print, but you get the idea. Implied warranties are merely default rules. \nFreedom of contract allows the parties to contract around the default rules, \nwhich sellers usually do by doing all of the following:\n163  Chapter 10: Finding Unwritten Terms That Complete the Contract\n ✓ Disclaiming the implied warranties\n ✓ Presenting an express warranty (as I explain earlier in “Making  \nexpress warranties”)\n ✓ Limiting the remedy for breach\nWhether you’re drafting a disclaimer or evaluating a contract to determine \nwhether it has disclaimers and limitations that are likely to stick, you need to \nknow what the Code says about it and how the courts are likely to form their \ndecisions. This section provides the guidance you need.\nMaking warranty disclaimers  \nspecific and conspicuous\nWhen a contract includes a disclaimer, the UCC wants to make sure that the \nbuyer knows about it, so sellers and their attorneys must do the following:\n ✓ Use specific language to disclaim the implied warranty of good title:  \nThe disclaimer must use specific language that addresses the warranty \nof title, such as “Seller gives no warranty that he has good title to the \ngoods sold.” General language, such as “There are no warranties express \nor implied,” doesn’t cut it.\n ✓ Use specific language to disclaim the implied warranty of merchant -\nability:  According to UCC § 2-316(2), the disclaimer must be specific and \ninclude the word merchantability,  as in “NO WARRANTIES, INCLUDING \nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, ARE INCLUDED.”\n  The Code provides sellers with an exception — UCC § 2-316(3) allows \nsellers to use expressions like “AS IS” to disclaim the implied warranties \nof merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, because “AS IS” \ngenerally communicates to buyers that they’re not getting a warranty.\n ✓ Make the disclaimer conspicuous to the buyer:  According to UCC § \n2-316(2), the disclaimer must be conspicuous, meaning presented in a \nway that a reasonable person is expected to notice it. This is why you \noften see big print in contracts stating something like the following:\n  THERE ARE NO WARRANTIES INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO \nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY.\n  This particular language would probably qualify under the Code. It \ndisclaims the implied warranty of merchantability because it uses the \nword merchantability,  is conspicuous, and disclaims all other warranties, \nincluding the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose, which \nmust be conspicuous but doesn’t require any particular words.\n164 Part III: Analyzing Contract Terms and Their Meaning \n Sellers rarely disclaim all warranties, because if they did, they’d probably \ndrive away many prospective customers. Instead, they typically disclaim all \nimplied warranties (to clear the slate), offer an express warranty with a lim -\nited scope, and limit the remedy for breach. These three strategies reduce the \nseller’s exposure to risk while still offering buyers some assurance that the \nseller is willing to stand behind the product.\nLimiting the remedy for breach\nSellers often give an express warranty but limit the remedy for breach of that \nwarranty. They may do so by\n ✓ Limiting the amount the buyer can recover for direct damage (loss of \nthe product itself):  Sometimes sellers limit the amount that buyers can \nrecover for breach of warranty to the purchase price of the product, \nrepair costs, or the cost of parts (excluding labor).\n ✓ Limiting the consequential damages (losses resulting from the loss \nof the product):  Frequently, although sellers may agree to pay to fix \ndefects in the goods themselves, they disclaim liability for consequential \ndamages, such as ruining your vacation because your car broke down. \n(See Chapter 17 for info on consequential damages.)\n ✓ Limiting the duration of the promise to provide a remedy:  Sellers often \nlimit the duration of the time during which they’ll repair defects, such as \none year from the purchase.\nThe UCC allows these limitations with the exception that sellers can’t dis -\nclaim liability for personal injury caused by consumer goods. Section 2-719 \nprovides buyers with additional recourse. As enacted in North Carolina at \n25-2-719(2), this section states that “where circumstances cause an exclusive \nor limited remedy to fail of its essential purpose, remedy may be had as pro -\nvided in this act.”\nThis section of the Code is sometimes used when the seller provides an \nexpress warranty to “repair or replace” defective products. If, after the seller \nhas made a number of attempts at repairing the product, the buyer still \ndoesn’t have a working product, then the remedy hasn’t accomplished its \nessential purpose, which is to give the buyer a working product. In that case, \nother remedies that the Code allows may become available, such as revoca -\ntion of acceptance — giving back the goods and getting the money back. This \nsame relief is offered for defective cars covered by warranty under the lemon \nlaws enacted in most jurisdictions.\n165  Chapter 10: Finding Unwritten Terms That Complete the Contract\nDrafting a disclaimer of warranty\nNo disclaimer of warranty is suitable for every seller’s needs, but when draft -\ning a disclaimer, most sellers include the following:\n ✓ A disclaimer of the implied warranties\n ✓ An express warranty\n ✓ A time period during which they’ll honor the express warranty\n ✓ A disclaimer of consequential damages or some other limitation  \nof remedy\n ✓ The possible remedies, such as replacing or repairing the product  \nor offering credit\n ✓ Who determines what the remedy is (You probably want to give  \nyour client, the seller, the sole right to choose the remedy.)\n In the following example, the first paragraph states the express warranty, the \nsecond presents the disclaimer of all implied warranties, and the third pro -\nvides a disclaimer of consequential damages:\nIf within one year from the date of sale, any product sold under this pur -\nchase order, or any part thereof, shall prove to be defective in material or \nworkmanship upon examination by the Manufacturer, the Manufacturer \nwill supply an identical or substantially similar replacement part f.o.b. \nthe Manufacturer’s factory, or the Manufacturer, at its option, will repair \nor allow credit for such part.\nNO OTHER WARRANTY, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED AND INCLUDING \nA WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR \nPURPOSE, HAS BEEN OR WILL BE MADE BY OR ON BEHALF OF \nTHE MANUFACTURER OR THE SELLER OR BY OPERATION OF LAW \nWITH RESPECT TO THE EQUIPMENT AND ACCESSORIES OR THEIR \nINSTALLATION, USE, OPERATION, REPLACEMENT OR REPAIR.\nNEITHER THE MANUFACTURER NOR THE SELLER SHALL BE LIABLE BY \nVIRTUE OF THIS WARRANTY, OR OTHERWISE, FOR ANY SPECIAL OR \nCONSEQUENTIAL LOSS OR DAMAGE RESULTING FROM THE USE OR \nLOSS OF THE USE OF EQUIPMENT AND ACCESSORIES.\nNote that in this particular disclaimer, the Manufacturer (the seller) has \nthe right to determine whether the product is, in fact, defective and has the \nchoice of supplying a substantially similar replacement part, repairing the \npart, or providing credit.\n166 Part III: Analyzing Contract Terms and Their Meaning \nRecognizing the statutory  \nregulation of disclaimers\nContract law doesn’t allow sellers to disclaim everything. Federal and state \nstatutes directly regulate certain transactions (see Chapter 5), requiring \nsellers to put certain terms in the contract or forbidding them from includ -\ning certain terms. For example, many states regulate contracts with dance \nstudios and gyms. Other consumer protection legislation is directed toward \nparticular aspects of the transaction, such as the financing or warranties. The \nMagnuson-Moss Warranty Act, for example, provides remedies for breach of \ncertain warranties.Holiday hassles: A case study  \nin disclaimers of warranty\nA typical example of how the courts deal with \nwarranty terms is Murray v. Holiday Rambler, \nInc. The Murrays bought a Holiday Rambler \nmotor home that came with an express “repair \nor replace” warranty, a disclaimer of implied \nwarranties, and an exclusion of consequential \ndamages. The Murrays immediately had numer -\nous problems with different systems. They kept \nbringing the motor home in for repair, and the \ndefendant always fixed it, but the problems \nkept recurring. On one vacation trip, they had \nto abandon the vehicle and return home by car.\nThe court found that the contract contained \nan effective disclaimer of implied warranties \nand an express “repair or replace” warranty. \nHowever, even though Holiday Rambler had \nalways lived up to this promise, the court found \nthat the remedy failed to serve its essential \npurpose: providing the Murrays with a decent \nmotor home. Therefore, all remedies became \navailable. The Murrays were allowed to return \nthe motor home and get their money back.Holiday Rambler had also disclaimed liability for \nconsequential damages, such as damages for \nloss of use of the vehicle during their vacation. \nCourts are split on the issue of whether the dis -\nclaimer of consequential damages falls when the \nlimited remedy falls, but this court found it did — \nin other words, the Murrays qualified to receive \nconsequential damages. However, they were \nable to prove only $500 in consequential damages \nbecause they had poor records. They also didn’t \nreceive attorney’s fees, because the default rule \nis that each side pays its own fees, so they were \nout what they had to pay their lawyer.\nThe Murrays might’ve been better off making \ntheir claim under a lemon law. For one thing, \nmost lemon laws provide for a speedier reso -\nlution through nonbinding arbitration and for \nattorney’s fees if the consumer is successful in \ncourt. On the other hand, in many jurisdictions, \nlemon laws don’t apply to large vehicles like \nmobile homes.\n167  Chapter 10: Finding Unwritten Terms That Complete the Contract\nAs you draft a disclaimer or evaluate disclaimers in existing contracts, be \naware of any statutes that may govern transactions of the type addressed  \nin the contract.\n In warranty cases, you may be better off making a claim under a state lemon \nlaw rather than under warranty law. Most states have enacted lemon laws \nthat expressly apply the rule of UCC § 2-719(2) to automobiles under war -\nranty. Lemon laws provide protection when a limited remedy doesn’t serve its \nintended purpose. If a dealer is unable to fix a major problem after a number \nof attempts or a number of days in the shop, then the manufacturer must buy \nback the car.\nAn example of a statutory regulation in federal law is the FTC Used Car \nRegulation Rule, which is designed to ensure that buyers of used cars under -\nstand the warranty terms of the transaction. The used-car dealer must put a \nsticker on the side window of the car that clearly informs the consumer either \nthat they’re buying the car “AS IS — NO WARRANTY.” Or if the buyer is getting \na warranty, the sticker must state exactly what those warranty terms are.\n If a buyer purchases a used car from someone who’s not a dealer, the buyer \nreceives no implied warranty of merchantability. If the buyer wants a war -\nranty, he must use his freedom of contract to bargain for an express warranty \nfrom the seller.\nThe Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act:  \nA good idea . . . in theory, anyway\nThe federal Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act \nwas an interesting innovation. Congress \nwanted to improve the warranties that buyers \nwere getting, but it didn’t want to interfere with \nfreedom of contract. So instead of regulating \nthe terms of warranties, it required that sellers \nclearly inform buyers what warranty terms they \nwere getting. If the warranty provided a cer -\ntain level of quality, sellers could label it a “Full \nWarranty,” but if it didn’t, they had to describe \nit as a “Limited Warranty.”\nThe theory was that if consumers knew what \nthey were getting, they would shop for the best warranty, encouraging manufacturers to \ncompete in offering the best warranty. Voilà!  \nWarranties would be improved! Furthermore, \nthe act encourages attorneys to bring breach \nof warranty claims by providing that an attorney \nbringing a successful claim under it can recover \nattorney’s fees.\nIn spite of these goals, I’m not sure that the \nact has worked because you don’t see many \nFull Warranties, and few attorneys are bring -\ning claims under the act. Nevertheless, it’s \nan interesting experiment in using disclosure \nrather than regulation to influence the market.\n168 Part III: Analyzing Contract Terms and Their Meaning",14479

63-Grasping the Basics of Ambiguity.pdf,63-Grasping the Basics of Ambiguity,"Chapter 11\nInterpreting Contracts\nIn This Chapter\n▶ Understanding the difference between ambiguity and vagueness\n▶ Determining whether the language in a contract really is ambiguous\n▶ Clearing up ambiguities with the rules of interpretation and other techniques\n▶ Dealing with cases in which ambiguity defies interpretation\nC \nontracts consist of words. What the parties meant by the words and \nphrases they used in stating their agreement is often open to interpre -\ntation, which can be somewhat subjective and unreliable. To make contract \ninterpretation more objective, consistent, and predictable, contract law has \nestablished certain techniques and guidelines.\nAs an attorney, you must be able to interpret contracts to figure out what they \nmean and to write a contract in a way that makes its meaning clear to others. \nFurthermore, you need to be familiar with the techniques used in contract law \nto interpret contracts so you’re better equipped to anticipate how judges and \njuries are likely to rule. This chapter provides the requisite guidance.\nGrasping the Basics of Ambiguity\nAmbiguity  arises when a word or phrase has two or more conflicting mean -\nings. Ambiguity in a contract may lead one party to claim that the language \nmeans one thing while the other party says that it means something else. \nOne party usually claims that under its interpretation, the other party is in \nbreach, and the other argues that under its interpretation, it’s not in breach.\n For example, a buyer orders “oranges and grapefruit from Florida.” The seller \nsends grapefruit from Florida but oranges from elsewhere. The buyer claims \nthat the seller is in breach. Here, whether “from Florida” modifies only “grape -\nfruit” or both “oranges and grapefruit” is ambiguous.\nIn resolving such disputes, the goal of contract interpretation is to carry out \nwhat the parties intended. On this point, everyone agrees. But that’s about all \n170 Part III: Analyzing Contract Terms and Their Meaning \nthey agree on. Courts disagree on how to determine whether language is ambigu -\nous and then, if they find it ambiguous, on how to resolve the ambiguity.\n Don’t confuse ambiguity, which is almost always a bad thing, with vagueness, \nwhich may be desirable. Vague  means uncertain in meaning; however, with \nvagueness, the intended meaning revolves around a narrow range of meanings \nrather than the conflicting meanings that often arise with ambiguity. Vague \nwords like reasonable,  satisfactory, usual, and promptly  are the lawyer’s stock \nin trade, serving as tools to give one or both parties some breathing room. \nHere’s an example:\n ✓ Ambiguous wording:  “Notice of defects must be given within 10 days.”\n ✓ Explicit wording:  “Buyer must give notice of defects within 10 days after \nreceipt of the goods.”\n ✓ Vague wording:  “Buyer must give notice of defects promptly after \nreceipt of the goods.”\nThe first example is ambiguous because it’s not clear who has to give notice — \nthe buyer or the seller. Furthermore, the statement doesn’t say when the 10 days \nstarts running. The explicit wording makes these terms clear. The vague wording \nuses “promptly” rather than “within 10 days.” The disadvantage of this language \nis that it’s hard to tell whether a party has complied. The advantage is flexibility, \nbecause what is “prompt” may depend on the facts and circumstances or trade \nusage. Prompt notice in the case of delivery of an ice sculpture, for example, \nprobably differs from prompt notice in the case of delivery of a jet airplane.\n To avoid the morass of ambiguity, use clear, unambiguous language when \ndrafting contracts.\nIs ambiguity ever a good thing?\nAlthough I think detecting and avoiding ambi -\nguity is the best practice, some authorities see \n“calculated ambiguity” as sometimes neces -\nsary to hold a deal together. Situations may \narise when parties are deadlocked and would \nprefer an agreement with possible future \nuncertainty rather than no agreement at all.\nFor example, the parties to a labor agreement \nmay provide for a “cost of living adjustment.” Employees may think that “cost of living adjust -\nment” means only that wages increase if the \ncost of living rises, and management may inter -\npret it to mean that they can reduce wages if \nthe cost of living drops. If this issue becomes \na sticking point during negotiation, the par -\nties may agree to address the ambiguity in the \nfuture rather than suffer the consequences of \nhaving no agreement.",4555
64-Understanding How Courts Decide Whats Ambiguous.pdf,64-Understanding How Courts Decide Whats Ambiguous,"171  Chapter 11: Interpreting Contracts\nDoing the Interpretation Two-Step\nWhen facing the task of deciding the meaning of allegedly ambiguous lan -\nguage, courts divide the task into two parts:\n 1. Decide whether certain language is ambiguous.\n  Whether the language is ambiguous is a question for a court to resolve \nas a matter of law. The challenge is in deciding which evidence to admit \nto help make this determination.\n 2. Declare or determine the meaning:\n  • If the court finds that the language isn’t ambiguous, the court may \ndeclare the meaning.\n  • If the court finds that the language is ambiguous, the court must \ndecide which evidence is admissible to determine the meaning and \nthen seek ways to use that evidence to find the meaning. If deter -\nmining the meaning involves deciding fact questions, then a jury \nmay decide the meaning.\n To resolve questions of ambiguity, the courts often admit extrinsic (parol) evi -\ndence, but the parol evidence rule doesn’t come into play here (see Chapter 9 \nfor details on the parol evidence rule). The court isn’t deciding which terms are \nin the contract — that’s been resolved — but rather what the words mean. In \nother words, a court first uses the parol evidence rule to find the terms of the \ncontract and then uses the tools of interpretation to determine whether those \nterms are ambiguous and, if they are, what they mean.\nNevertheless, policy questions regarding which evidence to admit in making \nambiguity determinations are very similar to those that arise as a result of \nthe parol evidence rule. The hardest question for a court to resolve when \napplying the parol evidence rule is whether the parties intended the agree -\nment to be found just in the writing or in the writing plus other understand -\nings. Just as authorities are divided on where to look to answer that question, \nthey’re divided over which evidence courts should consider in determining \nwhether certain language is ambiguous.\n The process of deciding whether the language is ambiguous and the process \nof deciding what it means overlap to a great extent. The court often uses the \nsame evidence and techniques to determine whether the language is ambigu -\nous as it does in determining the meaning and intent of that language.\n172 Part III: Analyzing Contract Terms and Their Meaning \nUnderstanding How Courts  \nDecide What’s Ambiguous\nTo decide whether certain language in a contract is ambiguous and to deter -\nmine its meaning, courts may consult a number of resources, the most obvi -\nous of which is the contract itself. Beyond that is a spectrum of resources, \nranging from the most objective to the most subjective, that may include the \nfollowing (see Figure 11-1):\n ✓ The language of the contract\n ✓ Rules of interpretation\n ✓ Course of performance, course of dealing, and trade usage\n ✓ Objective sources, such as dictionaries\n ✓ Contextual understandings of the parties\n ✓ Testimony of the parties and their attorneys\nThis section addresses each of these resources in turn.\n Figure 11-1:   \nThe  \nspectrum of \nevidence for \ndetermining \nambiguity \nbegins with \nthe contract.\n Testimony of\nParties\nand\nAttorneysContextObjective\nEvidenceCourse of Performance\nCourse of Dealing\nTrade UsageRules of\nInterpretationThe Contract\nApplying the rules of interpretation\nCertain rules govern the reading and interpretation of contracts. These rules pro -\nvide the courts, attorneys, and parties some guidance in determining whether \ncertain language is actually ambiguous and, if it is, how to determine its intended \nmeaning. This section describes these rules and explains how to apply them.\nApplying the plain-meaning rule: Looking at the contract itself\nAccording to the plain-meaning rule,  the court should look only at the con -\ntract itself to determine whether the language is ambiguous. In other words, \nif a judge reads the contract language and concludes that its meaning is clear, \n173  Chapter 11: Interpreting Contracts\nthe judge won’t consider other evidence about what the contract means or \nthe parties intended it to mean.\nThis rule, which is the most widely held view, has the advantage of efficiency: \nCourts only have to look at the contract and don’t have to consider other \nevidence. Critics challenge this rule by arguing that words mean something \nonly in context. This criticism has some validity, but the plain-meaning rule \ndoesn’t ignore looking at the context in a legal sense.\n For example, if a contract provides for a “floor” and a “ceiling,” the court \nwould certainly look at the context to determine the type of contract — a \nconstruction contract or a financing arrangement. But the court would look at \nthat context only to determine what’s reasonably meant in that context and \nnot what the parties may have actually meant.\nUsing tools of interpretation\nHistorically, courts use a number of devices to interpret the meaning of cer -\ntain words and phrases without looking beyond the “four corners” of the con -\ntract. Collectively, you can refer to these as the rules of interpretation.  Here \nis one listing of the rules of interpretation taken from Laurence P. Simpson, \nContracts  (West, 1965):\nThe three primary rules of interpretation are:\n 1. Words are to be given their plain and normal meaning, except:\n (a) Usage may vary the normal meaning of words.\n (b) Technical words are to be given their technical meaning.\n (c)  Where possible, words will be given the meaning which best \neffectuates the intention of the parties.\n 2. Every part of a contract is to be interpreted, if possible, so as to carry \nout its general purpose.\n 3. The circumstances under which the contract was made may always \nbe shown.\nIf after applying the primary rules the meaning of the contract is yet not \nclear, there are secondary rules tending to the same end — to ascertain \nand effectuate the intention of the parties. They are:\n 1. Obvious mistakes of writing, grammar or punctuation will be corrected.\n 2. The meaning of general words or terms will be restricted by more \nspecific descriptions of the subject matter or terms of performance.\n 3. A contract susceptible of two meanings will be given the meaning \nwhich will render it valid.\n 4. Between repugnant clauses, a possible interpretation which removes \nthe conflict will be adopted.\n174 Part III: Analyzing Contract Terms and Their Meaning \n 5. A contract will, if possible, be interpreted so as to render it reason -\nable rather than unreasonable.\n 6. Words will generally be construed most strongly against the party \nusing them.\n 7. In case of doubt, the interpretation given by the parties is the best \nevidence of their intention.\n 8. Where conflict between printed and written words, the writing governs.\nThink of these rules as the application of common sense. For example, if \na contract provides for a seal to be placed on it, you could look to Rule 5 \nfor guidance: “A contract will, if possible, be interpreted so as to render it \nreasonable rather than unreasonable.” Reasonable is determining the word \n“seal” in the given context to mean a stamp. Unreasonable would be to define \n“seal” in this context as a sea mammal.\nMaking sense of some Latin expressions\nMany rules of interpretation originated in Roman law and go by their Latin \nnames. Here are the two most important:\n ✓ Expressio unius est exclusio alterius  (“the expression of one thing \nexcludes another”):  According to expressio unius est exclusio alterius,  if \nthe contract lists several items but excludes another, then the parties \nprobably intended the excluded item to be excluded.\n ✓ Ejusdem generis  (“things of the same kind”):  According to ejusdem \ngeneris,  wording like “including but not limited to,” which is commonly \nused to avoid the pitfalls of expressio unius est exclusio alterius,  applies \nonly to things of the same kind.\n For example, the parties include in their contract a force majeure clause that \nlists the events that excuse the seller’s nonperformance (read more about \nforce majeure  in Chapter 13). They write:\nSeller’s performance is excused in the event seller is unable to perform \nbecause of fire, flood, earthquake, or hurricane.\nThis term is ambiguous because the intention seems to be to excuse the \nseller’s performance in the event of a major catastrophe, but not all major \ncatastrophes are listed. Suppose a tornado hits the seller’s plant, and he \nclaims that the intention of this clause was to excuse him. The buyer would \nsay, “Sorry, I don’t see tornado  on that list of excusing events. According to \nexpressio unius est exclusio alterius, the fact that fire, flood, earthquake, and \nhurricane are listed and tornado isn’t indicates intent to exclude tornado \ndamage.” The buyer would probably win the argument.\nHaving learned his lesson, the seller redrafts his force majeure  clause by \nusing the handy expression “including but not limited to”:\n175  Chapter 11: Interpreting Contracts\nSeller’s performance is excused in the event seller is unable to perform for \nany reason, including but not limited to fire, flood, earthquake, or hurricane.\nNow the seller can’t perform because his workers went on strike. The buyer \ncan’t claim expressio unius,  but she can now claim ejusdem generis.  That is, \nwhen the seller listed “fire, flood, earthquake, or hurricane,” he meant things \nthat are of the same kind as natural disasters, and a strike is not that kind \nof thing. The buyer would probably win that one, too, so the seller may try \nagain with something like this:\nSeller’s performance is excused in the event seller is unable to perform \nbecause of fire, flood, earthquake, or hurricane, or other excusing event \nwhether of the type enumerated or not.\nThis wording affords the seller additional protection.\nConstruing against the drafter: Contra proferentem\nOne of the rules of interpretation that many courts are fond of is contra proferen -\ntem, which I jokingly translate as “stick it to the insurance company” but which \nactually means “against the one who offered it” — that is, against the side that \ndrafted the contract. This is a very handy weapon to use against big businesses \nlike banks and insurance companies that draft contracts of adhesion  (boilerplate \ncontracts that readers often merely skim and sign without much thought).\nThe trouble with this rule is that it doesn’t really attempt to determine from \nthe language what the parties intended. Instead, it takes a shortcut to resolve \nthe dispute. Some courts are quick to use contra proferentem  right off the bat, \nand others use it as a last resort when all other attempts at interpretation fail.\nExamining the baggage the  \nparties bring to the contract\nGoing beyond the contract language itself, courts often look to the past expe -\nrience of the parties, which may not appear in the contract — the parties \nare so accustomed to the practice that they assume it’s part of the contract. \nThis past experience may include terms they intended to be part of the con -\ntract and meanings they’ve assigned to certain words and phrases. If not \nexpressed in the contract, these terms and meanings may come from\n ✓ Course of performance\n ✓ Course of dealing\n ✓ Usage of trade\nThis section explains how each of these factors may contribute to revealing \nand clearing up ambiguities.\n176 Part III: Analyzing Contract Terms and Their Meaning \n According to Official Comment 1 to UCC § 2-202, evidence of past experience \nshould be admitted to show that language is ambiguous regardless of whether \nthe court first finds that the language is ambiguous.\nLooking for a course of performance\nCourse of performance  is a pattern of performance, under a single contract, \nthat one party establishes and the other accepts or at least doesn’t object to \nwithin a reasonable amount of time. The course of performance sets the stan -\ndard of performance between the parties under that contract.\n For example, a business contracts with a trash pickup service to have the \nbusiness’s trash hauled away for six months. For the first six weeks, the ser -\nvice picks up the trash once a week. The business then complains that the \ntrash should be picked up more often. With no express term in the contract \naddressing the frequency of trash pickup, a court is likely to look at the course \nof performance. Because the trash pickup service picked up the trash once \na week for six weeks without the business complaining about it, the parties \nestablished a course of performance that becomes part of the contract. The \ndecision would probably favor the trash pickup service because the course  \nof performance established the meaning of the language.\nThe number of performances required to establish a course of performance \nhas never been established, but I can confidently tell you that it’s more than \none. Put yourself in the shoes of the trash pickup service in this example. After \nperforming once a week for some time without objection by the business, the \ntrash pickup service reasonably concluded that the term had been established.\nChecking for a course of dealing\nCourse of dealing  is a pattern established through performance of a series of pre -\nvious contracts between the same parties. When interpreting contract language, \ncourts may look at the parties’ transaction history to determine meaning.\n For example, suppose a contract between a buyer and a seller states that the \nbuyer is to pay within 30 days of delivery. In performing previous contracts with \nthis seller that contained the same term, the buyer has always taken a 5 percent \ndiscount when it pays within 10 days of delivery. When the buyer does this with \nthe next purchase, the seller can’t complain that this term is not part of the agree -\nment, because the course of dealing established a pattern that has led the buyer \nto believe that this term is part of it. If the seller wants to put an end to the prac -\ntice, he can say in this contract “no discount for early payment” or “evidence of \ncourse of dealing is not admissible to supply terms or meaning to this contract.”\nSeeking usage of trade\nTrade usage  refers to language that has a special meaning in a certain indus -\ntry or to customs that prevail in that industry. If parties engage in a dispute \nover what a term or phrase means and the word or phrase has a specific \nmeaning that industry insiders all know, then courts often look to trade  \nusage to determine meaning.\n177  Chapter 11: Interpreting Contracts\n For the most part, you must be in a trade in order to be bound by trade usage. In \nthe notorious “chicken” case, Frigaliment Importing Co. v. B.N.S. International Sales \nCorp. , an experienced buyer purchased chicken from a novice seller and received \nstewing chickens rather than the broilers he was expecting. The buyer claimed \nthat in the trade, “chicken” meant broilers, not stewing chicken. The seller said it \ncouldn’t be expected to know that because it was new to the trade. The court said \nthat even if you’re new to a trade, you’re bound by trade usages if either (1) you \nactually knew it or (2) it’s such common knowledge that it would be imputed to \nyou. (In the end, the buyer was unable to prove either of these points.)\nThis reasoning shows that contract law often looks for objective, not sub -\njective, understanding. That is, if a reasonable person in that same position \nwould’ve known something, then a party in that position is assumed to know \nit, regardless of whether the party actually knew it. In legal circles, you say \nthat the knowledge is imputed  to him.\n Suppose you’re renovating your basement and you buy a bunch of two-by-\nfours from the lumber store. You then claim breach of contract because the \ntwo-by-fours measured only 1.5 inches by 3.5 inches (the standard dimensions \nof a two-by-four). After squelching a chuckle, the lumber store rep claims that \ntrade usage of the term two-by-four  describes wood with the standard dimen -\nsions of 1.5 x 3.5 inches, not 2 x 4 inches. You could claim that you’re not in \nthe trade, but that wouldn’t matter, because just about everybody who’s ham -\nmered a nail knows that. The knowledge is imputed to you, and you lose.\n Don’t be afraid to ask a lot of dumb questions to get to know your client’s \nbusiness. Parties in the trade frequently neglect to put trade usages expressly \nin their contracts because they’re so steeped in the norms of that business \nthat they don’t even think about it. This can make the task of reading a client’s \ncontracts difficult if you don’t know which special meanings they have  \nor practices they follow that they haven’t stated in the contract.\nResolving conflicts through the hierarchy of meaning\n When evidence of course of performance, course of dealing, and trade usage \nconflict, resolve the conflicts by following the hierarchy of meaning  that estab -\nlishes which one governs over the others. The hierarchy, as found in UCC  \n§ 1-303, is as follows:\nTrade usage driving you crazy?\nIf dealing with trade usage drives you crazy, \nseeing a therapist might not be a good idea. \nSuppose she tells you she charges $100 an \nhour. You see her for four 45-minute sessions, and she sends you a bill for $400. When you \ncomplain that you’ve seen her for only a total of \nthree hours, she explains, “Oh, no. The ‘thera -\npeutic hour’ is 45 minutes.”\n178 Part III: Analyzing Contract Terms and Their Meaning \n 1. Express term\n  Obviously, an express term should and does trump evidence from any \nand all of the other sources, because this is the rule that the parties say \nthey want to govern their agreement. For example, in the chicken case \n(see the preceding section), if the contract had included the definition \n“In this contract, ‘chicken’ means broilers,” then how the parties define \n“chicken” from course of performance, course of dealing, or trade usage \nwouldn’t matter. The one exception occurs when course of performance \nleads to a waiver, as I explain in the next section.\n 2. Course of performance\n  Lacking an express term, the pattern of behavior that the parties estab -\nlish in performing the terms of the contract carries the most weight in \nestablishing its meaning.\n 3. Course of dealing\n  Evidence from previous transactions between the two parties carries \nless weight than course of performance but more weight than trade \nusage in determining the meaning.\n 4. Trade usage\n  When all else fails, the industry standard determines the meaning.\nFollowing are examples that demonstrate how a court might apply the hierar -\nchy of meaning to resolve disputes.\n The present contract contains no express term defining the word “chicken,” \nbut under previous contracts, the seller always supplied this buyer with broil -\ners. Under the present contract, which calls for multiple shipments, the seller \nsupplies stewers. After four shipments of stewers, the buyer wakes up and \nsays, “Hey, our course of dealing called for broilers. That’s what you should \nbe sending us.” Unfortunately, it’s too late for the buyer to complain. Although \nthe course of dealing initially established that “chicken” meant broilers, the \nbuyer acquiesced in a course of performance by accepting repeated perfor -\nmances without objecting. In the hierarchy, course of performance trumps \ncourse of dealing, so the seller wins.\nAssume now that the seller has always supplied broilers under previous con -\ntracts. Under the present contract, the seller supplies stewers and the buyer \nimmediately protests. “But,” the seller argues, “the trade usage calls for stew -\ners, so we’re just doing what’s the normal trade practice.” Unfortunately for the \nseller, course of dealing trumps trade usage, so by establishing through course \nof dealing that “chicken” means broilers, the seller loses this one. (The seller \nwould’ve been right if it had followed the trade practice initially, but it didn’t.)\nDetermining when a waiver exists\nIn certain cases, course of performance may result in a waiver of an express \nterm, meaning course of performance then trumps the express term (perhaps \n179  Chapter 11: Interpreting Contracts\nonly temporarily). Such cases arise when one party lulls the other into thinking \nthat the express term won’t be enforced. The party doing the lulling passively \nwaives its right to enforce the express term but can undo the waiver by giving \nnotice that it expects the other party to honor the express term in the future.\n Assume, for example, that a car buyer promises the seller to make 24 pay -\nments on the first of the month. The contract expressly states that if the \nbuyer doesn’t do so, the seller has the right to declare the full amount due \nand repossess the car. For six months in a row, the buyer pays on the fifth \nor sixth day of the month. When the buyer doesn’t pay on the first day of the \nseventh month, the seller declares the full amount due and repossesses the \ncar. Here, the express term called for payment on the first, but the course of \nperformance led the buyer to believe that making payments a few days late is \nacceptable. This waiver moves course of performance above express term in \nthe hierarchy, so the seller had no right to repossess the car.\nHowever, the displacement could be temporary. The seller could inform the \nbuyer that it won’t tolerate any more late payments. The seller is no longer \nleading the buyer to believe that the late performance is acceptable, so the \nbuyer is once again bound by that express term.\nBringing in objective meaning  \nfrom outside the contract\nAfter looking at the contract itself and evidence of course of performance, \ncourse of dealing, and trade usage, many courts look at objective mean -\nings from outside the contract to decide whether language is ambiguous. \nObjective meaning comes in two types, depending on the definition of  \nobjective. Objective meaning may be\n ✓ Meanings used by reasonable people, as opposed to whatever meaning \na party conjures up:  This is the usual meaning of objective. For example, a \ndictionary definition and a trade usage are meanings by reasonable people.\n ✓ Meanings that the parties to the contract have manifested in some \nway, as opposed to being found only in their heads:  The discussions \nthe parties had prior to signing the contract and earlier drafts of their \nagreements are examples of sources of this kind of objective meaning.\n An extreme example of the second meaning of objective  would be a secret \ncode that the parties had worked out. For example, suppose a stock trader \nworks in a cubicle where he’s afraid his fellow workers can hear his telephone \nconversations. He and his broker agree to use coded language in which “buy” \nmeans to sell and “sell” means to buy. He calls and tells his broker to “sell \n100 shares of XYZ.” The broker proceeds to sell 100 shares of XYZ. Under the \nmeaning of “sell” used by reasonable people, this isn’t breach of contract.",23262
65-Dealing with Misunderstanding.pdf,65-Dealing with Misunderstanding,"180 Part III: Analyzing Contract Terms and Their Meaning \nHowever, under the meaning the parties agreed to, it is breach. Can the trader \nintroduce evidence that the parties had agreed on this meaning? Not surpris -\ningly, courts are divided on this question.\nConsidering subjective evidence:  \nContext and testimony\nIn determining whether language is ambiguous, some courts go to the far end \nof the spectrum to look not only at the contract itself and objective evidence \nbut also at all evidence in and around the contract in context. This differs \nfrom the plain-meaning approach because the plain-meaning approach con -\nsiders only what reasonable people  would have intended, whereas the con -\ntext approach looks at what the actual parties  would have intended.\nAt the subjective end of the spectrum of meaning are meanings that the par -\nties had in mind or the meanings their lawyers had in mind when they drafted \nthe contract — evidence gathered from testimony of the parties and their \nattorneys. Most courts, however, reject this subjective evidence, because \nmaking it up after the fact is far too easy.\nDeciding What Something Means\nAfter reviewing the evidence to determine whether certain language is ambigu -\nous, the court may determine that the language isn’t ambiguous and simply \ndeclare its meaning based on what the evidence indicates. If the court instead \ndecides that the language is ambiguous, it moves on to the second step: decid -\ning which evidence to admit to resolve the ambiguity. Admissible evidence \nusually consists of evidence heard during the first step (determining whether \nthe language is ambiguous) and may include additional evidence from a larger \npart of the spectrum (refer to Figure 11-1).\nIf a court applying the plain-meaning rule determines that the language is \nambiguous, it may resolve the ambiguity by using the rules of interpretation, \nincluding contra proferentem (against the offeror). However, it may also con -\nsider other objective evidence.\n For example, a contract for the sale of a house states that the sale price is \n“$130,000 (one hundred twenty thousand dollars).” On its face, this is an obvi -\nous ambiguity — a conflict between the numbers and the words. Resolving \nthis one against the party who happened to draft the contract would seem \narbitrary. A court could resolve it by using the rule of interpretation that \nwords govern over numbers on the theory that when you take time to write \nsomething out, that more likely expresses your intent. However, those tech -\nniques don’t really get at what these parties intended. It would seem more \n181  Chapter 11: Interpreting Contracts\nreasonable to look to other evidence like preliminary agreements and earlier \ndrafts of the contract to determine the price the parties intended.\nUsually, courts are able to use these devices to resolve a problem of interpre -\ntation. They either determine what the parties intended or what reasonable \nparties would’ve intended, and the parties have to live with that. In either \nevent, the contract lives on. In some cases, however, courts are unable to \ndetermine the intended meaning and must declare that the parties have a \nmisunderstanding, as I explain next.\nDealing with Misunderstanding\nWhen courts are unable to resolve a conflict between two meanings, the par -\nties have a misunderstanding  — a problem of interpretation that can render \na contract void. Some folks like to define “misunderstanding” as a failure of \nthe parties to achieve a “meeting of the minds,” but that’s not accurate. The \nproblem is that the language manifested in the contract has two meanings \nand that the court is unable to determine which meaning the parties intended \nor which meaning reasonable parties would’ve intended.\n The classic example is the infamous case of Raffles v. Wichelhaus, which \ninvolved the good ships Peerless.  The parties entered into a contract to buy \nand sell cotton to arrive in London “ ex Peerless, ” meaning delivered on the \nship Peerless.  Apparently, however, two ships named Peerless  were scheduled \nfor London, one to arrive in October and the other to arrive in December. \nBecause of fluctuating market prices, the time of delivery was crucial.\nOf course, the parties wouldn’t admit that they were thinking about the same \nship Peerless . The buyer said he had in mind the October Peerless,  and the \nseller, the December Peerless.  Contract formation depends more on what rea -\nsonable people would have in mind (objective intent) than what the parties \nactually had in mind (subjective intent), as I explain in Chapter 2. Therefore, \nyou need to ask two questions:\n ✓ Would a reasonable person in the shoes of the buyer have known the \nseller intended the December Peerless?\n ✓ Would a reasonable person in the shoes of the seller have known the \nbuyer intended the October Peerless?\nIf the answer to either  of these questions is yes, then the parties have a con -\ntract for arrival on the Peerless  that one party actually had in mind and the \nother party should’ve had in mind. If the answer to both questions is yes or \nno, then you have to throw up your hands because you’re unable to deter -\nmine whether the parties had a contract for arrival on the October Peerless  \nor for arrival on the December Peerless.  In that event, no contract is formed.\n182 Part III: Analyzing Contract Terms and Their Meaning \nFortunately, as a practical matter, few interpretation cases end up this way. \nEither the term is immaterial, or the application of the many tools of interpre -\ntation reveals that one interpretation is more reasonable than the other.Including outside evidence: What is chicken?\nThe famous case of Frigaliment Importing Co. v. \nB.N.S. International Sales Corp. is a trial court \nopinion that shows how a court goes about \nresolving ambiguities in contracts. Under a \ncontract calling for the shipment of chicken, the \nseller shipped stewing chicken. The buyer cried \nfoul, claiming that “chicken” meant broilers.\nJudge Friendly wasted little time making the \ninitial determination that the language was \nambiguous — “chicken” may mean stewers \nor broilers or both. So which meaning did the \nparties intend? More important, what would a \nreasonable party have meant?\nThe judge considered a wide spectrum of \nevidence — evidence from the contract and \nfrom government regulations referenced in \nthe contract along with prices in the contract \nthat may have indicated what a reasonable \nparty would’ve expected at that price. Other \nevidence came from what the parties told each other during negotiation, the documents they \nexchanged, and the course of performance, \nbecause the chicken arrived in more than one \nshipment.\nMost of the argument revolved around trade \nusage — what members of the trade thought \nthey were getting when they bought and sold \nchicken.\nConsidering the contradictory evidence, Judge \nFriendly concluded that the plaintiff buyer had \nnot satisfied the burden of proving that its \nmeaning, broilers only, was more reasonable. \nA few years later, he had second thoughts and \nrealized that he could’ve decided this as a mis -\nunderstanding case. If the contract used the \nword “chicken” and the parties ascribed differ -\nent meanings to it, and if neither party was able \nto show that its meaning was more reasonable, \nthen the judge could’ve concluded that the par -\nties didn’t form a contract.",7540

67-Considering Modifications Made during Performance.pdf,67-Considering Modifications Made during Performance,"Chapter 12\nEvaluating Whether Contract \nModifications Are Enforceable\nIn This Chapter\n▶ Evaluating the enforceability of modifications made during performance\n▶ Knowing when  no oral modification clauses  carry weight\n▶ Recognizing when a party can make modifications unilaterally\n▶ Using accord and satisfaction to determine when a partial payment discharges a debt\nC \nontracts usually call for future performance, and because no one can \npredict the future, parties may modify their contracts to accommodate \nunforeseen circumstances. Unfortunately, when parties modify a contract, \nthey often don’t take the steps necessary to make the modifications clearly \nenforceable. As a result, after agreeing to a modification, one party may \nclaim breach during performance while the other party claims it’s not in \nbreach because the original contract was modified. Or after one party has \nperformed, the parties may enter into an accord in which they agree that the \nother doesn’t have to pay as much as they originally agreed to. The courts \nmust then determine whether the modification or the accord is enforceable.\nWhen the parties modify the contract makes a big difference:\n ✓ Before completing performance:  An executory contract is a contract  \nthat neither party has fully performed. When parties modify an execu -\ntory contract , the courts analyze the contract according to the law  \nof modification.\n ✓ After one party has fully performed:  When the modification occurs \nafter one party has fully performed, you’re dealing with a contract fully \nexecuted by one party.  The courts analyze the contract according to  \nthe law of accord and satisfaction. ( Accord  is an agreement to discharge  \na debt by the payment of less money. Satisfaction  is performance of  \nthat accord.)\n186 Part IV: Performing the Contract or Breaching It \nThis chapter explores some of the ways parties modify contracts before  \nand after a party has fully performed. You discover how courts respond to \nthese modifications in each case so that you’re better equipped to advise \nyour clients and represent them when such modifications become the basis \nof a dispute.\nConsidering Modifications  \nMade during Performance\nTo determine whether a contract modification made during performance is \nenforceable, you must examine several factors, including whether consid -\neration was required, whether the modification falls within the statute of \nfrauds, and whether the original contract has a  no oral modification  (NOM) \nclause or a clause that gives a party the right to make modifications uni -\nlaterally. This section explains how to evaluate these factors to determine \nwhether a modification made during performance is enforceable.\nDetermining whether consideration  \nis required\nIn theory, a contract modification is a new contract, requiring offer, accep -\ntance, and consideration (see Chapters 2 and 3). Contract modifications, \nhowever, don’t always require consideration. To determine whether a modi -\nfication is enforceable, the courts first consider whether the contract falls \nwithin UCC Article 2 (contracts for the sale of goods):\n ✓ Within the UCC:  The courts must follow the Code rule enacted by the \nlegislature, § 2-209(1), and according to that rule, no consideration is \nnecessary for a modification.\n ✓ Not within the UCC:  If you have a common-law case, some courts follow \nthe old rule that if consideration is absent, then the modification is not \nenforceable. Other courts follow the Restatement, which says in § 59 \nthat the modification is enforceable as long as it’s “fair and equitable.”\n For example, a business rents a store in a shopping mall for two years at \n$1,000 per month, as reflected in a written lease. Shortly after the store opens, \nthe economy slides into recession and the store isn’t doing so well. The busi -\nness asks the mall whether it will agree to reduce the rent to $800 a month. \n187  Chapter 12: Evaluating Whether Contract Modifications Are Enforceable\nThe mall agrees, and the parties shake hands on it. After the business has paid \n$800 a month for six months, the mall claims that the business owes $1,200 — \nthe balance of the unpaid rent for six months. The business claims it modified \nthe contract and the mall agreed, but the mall says, “Ha-ha! You don’t remem -\nber your contract law. Consideration is required to make a promise enforce -\nable. We promised you a reduction in rent of $200 a month, but you didn’t \npromise us anything in return. Therefore, our promise isn’t enforceable.”\nThe mall is technically right as a matter of general contract law, but given \nthe fact that the parties agreed to a modification in good faith, letting the \nmall back out of its agreement to accept $200 less per month seems unjust. \nContract law has struggled to find a theory to enforce modifications like this \nthat the parties enter into in good faith. Here are some of the ways contract \nlaw has gotten around the problem:\n ✓ A party can provide something new or different as consideration.  The \nbusiness could avoid the consideration problem by bargaining to give \nsomething in return for the reduced rent. For example, the business \ncould say, “We’ll give you rent of $800 and a peppercorn rather than \n$1,000.” If the mall agreed, they’d have a bargained-for consideration. \nIs a peppercorn worth $200? If the parties say it is, the answer is yes — \nwhy should contract law disturb their agreement?\n ✓ The parties can tear up the old agreement (a process called mutual \nrescission ) and enter into a new one.  This solution works because \nmutual rescission gives each party consideration (something of value): \nthe release of their obligations under the contract. In effect, this process \ninvolves making three different contracts:\n  • The original contract:  The business rents the store for $1,000  \nper month.\n  • The mutual rescission: The mall gives up rights against the  \nbusiness, and the business gives up rights against the mall.\n  • The new contract:  The business rents the store for $800  \nper month.\n  The problem with this approach is that parties rarely take these three \nsteps, so a court that finds they did often uses a legal fiction,  pretending \nsomething happened in order to achieve a desirable outcome.\n ✓ Contract law can change the rules so that the modification is enforce -\nable even without consideration.  Contract law has taken this approach \nbut has done so differently in the common law and the UCC, as the next \ntwo subsections explain.\n188 Part IV: Performing the Contract or Breaching It \nDispensing with consideration: The UCC approach\nThe UCC has taken a straightforward approach to the problem of requiring \nconsideration for a contract modification: It says that no consideration is \nnecessary in such situations. Section 2-209(1) provides, “An agreement modi -\nfying a contract within this Article needs no consideration to be binding.”\nStatutes have this advantage — the legislature can make a sweeping change \nto the law. Of course, because this provision appears in Article 2, it applies \nonly to the sale of goods. If a seller of widgets agreed to reduce its con -\ntract price from $1,000 to $800, this provision would make the modification \nenforceable. But it wouldn’t help a business that agreed to a $200 rent reduc -\ntion in leasing a store from the mall.\n Just because the UCC does away with consideration in a modification doesn’t \nmean all modifications become enforceable. Other formation defenses (see \nChapters 5 and 6) still apply. For example, if the widget buyer threatened  \nthe seller with bodily harm if the seller didn’t agree to a price reduction,  \nthat modification wouldn’t be enforceable because the seller entered into  \nit under duress.\nA more subtle Code limitation on the enforceability of modifications is the  \ndoctrine of good faith and fair dealing (see Chapter 10). This doctrine is part of \nevery contract, regardless of whether the parties expressly include it in their \nagreement. Just because the Code says that a modification doesn’t require \nconsideration, not every modification lacking consideration is enforceable. The \ndoctrine of good faith can be used to prevent enforcement of a modification \nthat may otherwise be enforceable.\n In Roth Steel Products v. Sharon Steel Corp, the plaintiff had agreed to pur -\nchase various kinds of steel at various times from the defendant. At the time \nthey made the contract, the market for steel favored the buyer. But when the \nmarket later changed and steel became harder to obtain, the seller sought \nto modify the price. The buyer initially agreed to the modification but then \nsought to avoid it.\nThe Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, applying the Ohio UCC, acknowledged \nthat lack of consideration was not an argument that the buyer could use to \navoid the contract because § 2-209(1) specifically provides that a modifica -\ntion does not need consideration to be binding. However, the court pointed \nout that, as indicated in Official Comment 1 to § 2-209(1), “modifications \nmade thereunder must meet the test of good faith imposed by this Act.”\n189  Chapter 12: Evaluating Whether Contract Modifications Are Enforceable\nGood faith requires both the “observance of reasonable commercial standards \nof fair dealing in the trade” and “honesty in fact,” as I explain in Chapter 10. The \ncourt found that the first prong had been satisfied because the seller was expe -\nriencing a loss on the contract, and a reasonable seller in that situation would \nrequest a modification. However, the seller did not satisfy the second prong \nbecause it wasn’t honest in requesting the modification. Instead of explaining \nthat it believed the contract entitled it to pass on higher prices (an argument \nit came up with only during the litigation), the seller had threatened the buyer, \nsaying that it would not ship any steel to the buyer if it did not agree to the \nprice increase. That behavior is coercive and inconsistent with good faith.\nThe case makes clear that even though the UCC has done away with the \nrequirement of consideration for a modification, that doesn’t mean that all \nmodifications without consideration are enforceable. The courts can use the \ndoctrine of good faith to police behavior such as coercion, even if that behav -\nior does not rise to the level of duress, which was the principal way to avoid \na modification under the common law.\n Although a party must perform a contract in good faith, no requirement stipu -\nlates that a party must agree to a modification. If one party requests a change, \nthe other party is free to say no.\nEnforcing reasonable modifications: The common-law approach\nIn common law, courts set precedents, which lower courts in the jurisdiction \nmust follow, but which have only persuasive authority in other jurisdictions. \nIf enough courts follow the same rule, then it becomes the general rule, and it \nmay become the black-letter rule of the Restatement.\nOver time, a number of courts in common-law cases began to find contract \nmodifications enforceable even with consideration missing. The Restatement \nstates the rule this way in § 89(a):\n  § 89. Modification of Executory Contract\n  A promise modifying a duty under a contract not fully performed on \neither side is binding\n  (a) if the modification is fair and equitable in view of circumstances \nnot anticipated by the parties when the contract was made\nIf a court were to apply this rule to the rent-reduction scenario involving \nthe mall (see the earlier section “Determining whether consideration is \n190 Part IV: Performing the Contract or Breaching It \nrequired”), the court would probably find that the modification was enforce -\nable. The circumstances changed because of the economic recession, and \nthe parties freely agreed to the modification.\n The Restatement is not the law, and courts are free to ignore it. Rules in the \nRestatement are merely what the drafters found to be the rules. Usually the \ndrafters state the rules that a majority of jurisdictions follow, but sometimes \nthey state a rule they prefer even if it isn’t followed in the majority of cases. \nIn a common-law case, the court may follow the rule in the Restatement or \nignore it and stick to the old rule — in this case, refusing to enforce the modi -\nfication when consideration is absent. In a Code case, however, courts must \nfollow the UCC rule enacted by the legislature, and according to that rule, no \nconsideration is necessary for such modifications. (See Chapter 1 for details \non the UCC, the Restatement, and common law.)\nWritten requirements: Seeing whether the \nmodification is within the statute of frauds\nEven if a modification passes the consideration test, the agreement is still \nsubject to the other formation defenses, including the statute of frauds (see \nChapter 8) — the collective name for statutes that require written evidence \nof a contract. If the agreement is within the statute of frauds, then oral modi -\nfications don’t count.\n In the example presented earlier in this chapter, the parties orally agree to \nreduce the rent on a two-year lease from $1,000 to $800. Because this agree -\nment is related to real estate and real estate leases for more than one year \nare within the statute of frauds in most jurisdictions, the modification is not \nenforceable, even if it passes the consideration test. To be enforceable, the \nagreement would need to be in writing.\nIn the UCC, this rule appears in § 2-209(3), which provides that\n(3) The requirements of the statute of frauds section of this Article \n(Section 2-201) must be satisfied if the contract as modified is within  \nits provisions.\nThe UCC statute of frauds, § 2-201(1), requires contracts for the sale of goods \nfor $500 or more to be evidenced by a writing. The rule of § 2-209(3) clearly \napplies if the parties made an oral agreement to sell four widgets for $400 \n(not within the statute of frauds) and then orally modify it to a sale for $600 \n(within the statute of frauds) — the modified agreement would have to be \nevidenced by a writing to be enforceable. The rule is less clear if the parties \n191  Chapter 12: Evaluating Whether Contract Modifications Are Enforceable\nhad a written agreement to sell the four widgets for $1,000 and then orally \nagreed to drop the price to $800. The contract as modified is within the stat -\nute of frauds. Written evidence of the modified agreement exists; however, it \ndoesn’t include the new price term. You could argue that the writing doesn’t \nhave to contain all the terms, as I discuss in Chapter 8.\nCourts are divided on whether oral modifications to written agreements like \nthis are enforceable. One thing they do generally agree on, however, is that \nif the quantity  is modified, that modification has to be evidenced by a writ -\ning. For example, if the parties orally modify the agreement from four to five \nwidgets for $1,000, most authorities would find that the writing does not evi -\ndence this agreement.\nDealing with “no oral modification” clauses\nOne of the most common terms found in the boilerplate of contracts is the no \noral modification clause  (NOM). It functions as the parties’ own private statute \nof frauds providing that oral modifications don’t count. The UCC expressly per -\nmits parties to create an NOM. Section 2-209(2) provides in part that “A signed \nagreement which excludes modification or rescission except by a signed writ -\ning cannot be otherwise modified or rescinded.” This clause has a positive \nchanneling effect, encouraging the parties to get their modifications in writing. \nThe problem is that nine times out of ten, they don’t realize that the provision \nis there, or they ignore it, and they make an oral modification anyway.\nMost courts find that an oral modification made in the face of a NOM is \nenforceable, especially when it induces reliance. (I cover reliance in Chapter 4.) \nContract law authority Arthur Corbin says that the written contract the parties \nmake today can’t change what they agree to tomorrow. In other words, today \nthey agree that all modifications must be in writing. Tomorrow, by making an \noral modification, the parties imply an agreement to change their original rule \nand allow oral modifications. Courts frequently invoke the doctrine of waiver \nto get around the NOM. (A waiver  is a knowing relinquishment of a legal right.)\n For example, a bank has a written agreement with a borrower for a car loan. \nThe contract says that the customer agrees to make payments on the first \nof the month, and if she doesn’t, the bank can accelerate the debt (make the \nentire amount due) and repossess the car. The customer calls the bank and \nsays, “I’m having a temporary cash-flow problem. Would it be okay if I pay \nnext month on the tenth rather than the first?” The bank employee says, “No \nproblem.” However, the bank employee neglects to tell the department that \ndeals with defaults, and when the payment doesn’t arrive on the first, the  \nbank repossesses the car.\n192 Part IV: Performing the Contract or Breaching It \nOutraged, the customer says, “You agreed that I could have until the tenth to \npay.” The bank says, “Ha-ha! No consideration! We gave you another ten days \nto pay, but what did you do for us?” The customer says, probably rightly, \n“This is a case where the modification may be enforceable without consider -\nation under the rule found in Restatement § 89.” The bank says, “That may be \ntrue, but the contract that you freely agreed to has a NOM clause stating that \noral agreements don’t count.”\nRarely would a court let the bank get away with that argument. Most courts \nsay that the bank had the right to insist on the NOM, but it waived that right \nwhen it agreed to the oral modification, which led the customer to believe \nthat nothing terrible would happen if she paid ten days late. Her reliance on \nthe oral agreement makes it enforceable.\nThe UCC recognizes the waiver doctrine, providing in § 2-209(4) that both an \nagreement in violation of the NOM clause and an agreement in violation of \nthe statute of frauds are subject to waiver: “(4) Although an attempt at modi -\nfication or rescission does not satisfy the requirements of subsection (2) or \n(3) it can operate as a waiver.”\nAgreeing to future, unilateral modifications\nA cutting-edge question in contract law is whether the parties can agree that \none party has the right to make unilateral (one-sided) modifications during \nthe performance of the contract. In a number of cases, banks have done this \nto raise credit card interest rates in response to market changes.\n A contract would be illusory if one party in effect said to the other, “You’re \nfree to make whatever terms you want, and I will agree to them.” Such a provi -\nsion would undermine the idea that contracts represent the agreement of two \nparties. On the other hand, allowing unilateral modifications based on future \nevents makes sense in cases in which the parties can’t possibly predict a \nchange in circumstances.\nA rule that provides a good balance would permit the agreed-upon unilateral \nmodifications when they’re based on some objective standard. Under that \napproach, a party that had reserved the right to make unilateral modifica -\ntions would be allowed to change a term like a price or interest rate to  \nmeet a market standard but prohibited from changing terms unrelated to \nmarket fluctuations.\n For example, in a long-term written agreement, a seller sets the price of goods at \n$1,000 each, says nothing about dispute resolution, and reserves the right to \nchange the terms of the agreement. A few months later, the seller informs the \nbuyer that because of an increase in the price of its raw materials, starting next",20063
68-Making Changes after One Party Fully Performed Accord and Satisfaction.pdf,68-Making Changes after One Party Fully Performed Accord and Satisfaction,"193  Chapter 12: Evaluating Whether Contract Modifications Are Enforceable\nmonth, the price of the goods will be $1,050 each and all disputes will go to arbi -\ntration. Are these modifications enforceable? Although not all courts will agree, \nI think the best answer is yes and no. Assuming that the price increase reflects a \nchange in the market, the modified price increase is enforceable. However, the \nnew language concerning how arbitrations are to be handled is not enforceable, \nbecause it’s not tied to some future, objective change in circumstances.\nMaking Changes after One Party Fully \nPerformed: Accord and Satisfaction\nAfter one party has fully performed, the other party owes the contract price \nfor that performance. The party who performed is a creditor, and the party \nwho hasn’t performed is a debtor. In this case, only the debtor has something \nto bargain with (the unpaid debt), so allowing modification without consider -\nation doesn’t make sense. Either the debtor must pay up, or the parties may \ncut a deal through accord and satisfaction.\nAn accord  is a contract in which a creditor agrees to accept less than the full \namount of the debt in order to discharge the debt (satisfaction). Because an \naccord is a contract, all the elements of a contract I discuss in Part I, includ -\ning offer, acceptance, and consideration, must be present without any of the \ndefenses I discuss in Part II, including fraud, duress, and mistake.\n For example, a painter has agreed to paint a house for $10,000. When the \npainter finishes the job, the painter is now a creditor, and the owner owes a \ndebt of $10,000. The contract has been fully performed by one party — the \npainter — and the contract price is now due. If the debtor now offers to pay \nless, any agreement that results falls under the law of accord and satisfaction \nrather than modification.\nDetermining whether the parties formed \nan accord: Offer and acceptance\nLike any contract, an accord requires offer and acceptance, but what con -\nstitutes offer and acceptance in this case can get fuzzy. For example, if the \ndebtor owes the creditor $10,000 and sends the creditor a check for $8,000, \na reasonable person in the shoes of the creditor would think this was just a \npayment on account (a partial payment made with the intention of paying the \nrest later) and that the remaining $2,000 is still owed.\n194 Part IV: Performing the Contract or Breaching It \nIf the debtor intends the creditor to discharge the debt by accepting this \npartial payment, the debtor must make that clear in the offer. This issue often \narises with a conditional check,  in which the debtor writes the offer to dis -\ncharge the debt in fine print on the check. Although courts are divided on the \nissue of whether the fine print notice on the check is enough to constitute \nan offer, a wise debtor makes the offer clear in a separate communication to \navoid any dispute.\nIf the debtor makes a clear offer, the creditor has two choices:\n ✓ Accept the offer, thus discharging the debt upon acceptance of the  \npartial payment (the satisfaction).\n ✓ Reject the offer, in which case the debt remains.\nWhat the debtor can’t do is accept the payment (the offer) and claim the \nright to recover the rest of the debt. The acceptance must match the offer. \nThe offeree can’t change the offer and then accept the changed offer. This \nchoice may be tough for a creditor, because a creditor may live to regret not \naccepting that offer of partial payment.\nFinding consideration: Doing something \nadditional or different\nAssuming that the agreement to enter an accord passes the offer and accep -\ntance test, it must then pass the consideration test without breaking the \npre-existing duty rule. (The pre-existing duty rule  states that a party’s promise \nto do what it’s already bound to do doesn’t constitute consideration; see \nChapter 3 for details.) To get around the pre-existing duty rule, the debtor \nmust agree to do something additional to or different from what he promised \nin the original agreement.\n For example, assume that a debtor owes a creditor $10,000 on June 1. If the \ndebtor offers to pay $8,000 on June 1 to settle the debt, this isn’t consideration \nbecause the debtor is merely promising to pay part of what he was obligated \nto pay on the same date specified in the original contract. If, instead, the \ndebtor offers to pay $8,000 on May 31 to satisfy the debt and the creditor \naccepts, that’s consideration. The creditor got something he wasn’t legally \nentitled to: early payment. Is paying one day early worth $2,000? The law \ndoesn’t inquire into the adequacy of consideration. If the creditor bargained \nfor payment a day early, then consideration is satisfied.\n195  Chapter 12: Evaluating Whether Contract Modifications Are Enforceable\nFinding consideration in unliquidated \ndebts and debt-dispute settlements\nYou can often find consideration in either liquidation of an unliquidated debt \nor in settlement of a dispute between the parties, including a tort claim, as I \nexplain in this section.\nLiquidation of an unliquidated debt\nA debt is liquidated  if the parties or a court fixes the amount of the debt. It is \nunliquidated  if the parties have entered into a contract without specifying the \namount to be paid. Similarly, a tort claim is unliquidated because how much \nthe debtor will have to pay is unclear. If the debt is unliquidated, a dispute as \nto the amount owed may arise. Consideration in resolving that dispute exists \nbecause each side is getting something.\n If a painter offers to paint the owner’s home for $10,000 and the owner accepts, \nthey’ve liquidated the debt. On the other hand, if the painter offers to paint the \nowner’s home for some unspecified amount and the owner accepts, the debt is \nunliquidated. The contract is still valid, but the parties or a court must supply \nthe contract price (see Chapter 10 for details on supplying terms). Suppose the \npainter has finished painting and says, “That’ll be $10,000.” The owner says, \n“I don’t think it’s worth that much. I’m only willing to pay you $6,000.” If the \npainter refuses, the parties can ask a court to fill in the gap with an amount. Or \nthey can fix the amount themselves. The painter may say, “I’ll take $8,000,” and \nif the owner agrees, then they have an accord — they’ve liquidated the amount \nat $8,000. Both parties bargained to get something because if the court had liq -\nuidated the debt, the amount could’ve been more or less than $8,000.\nSettlement of a dispute between the parties\nA debt is disputed  if — even though the amount was agreed to originally — \none party raises a good-faith defense to payment. If the parties then settle  \nthe dispute, consideration exists, because each party got something out  \nof the settlement.\n For example, an homeowner and a painter agree that the painter will paint the \nowner’s house for $10,000. After the painter finishes painting the house, the \nowner says, “You did a terrible job painting. I don’t think you’ve lived up to \nthe implied standard of workmanlike performance I read about in Chapter 10 \nof Contract Law For Dummies.  But I’m willing to pay you $6,000.” The painter \nis perfectly free to reject the offer, sue the owner for $10,000, let the owner \n196 Part IV: Performing the Contract or Breaching It \nassert the defense as a breach of contract claim, and let the court determine \nthe amount due. Or the painter can say, “I’ll take $8,000,” and if the owner \nagrees, then they’ve reached an accord by settling the dispute for $8,000.  \nBoth parties bargained to get something, because if a court had resolved  \nthe dispute, the amount could’ve more or less than $8,000.\nSettlement of a tort claim\nAccord and satisfaction is a quick and dirty dispute-resolution mechanism \nthat also arises when an injured party makes a tort claim against the party \nwho allegedly caused the injury. The injured party is a creditor, and the party \nwho caused the injury is a debtor. The tort claim is clearly unliquidated and \ndisputed, so consideration exists if the parties negotiate a release  (an agree -\nment to settle the claim), as I explain in Chapter 7.\nFiguring out what happens when the \naccord has been satisfied . . . or not\nAfter the parties form an accord, it hovers like a fairy, awaiting performance \n(satisfaction). If the debtor pays according to the terms of the accord, he \nperforms the accord and satisfies the underlying debt. If the debtor fails to \nperform, he’s breached the accord, and the creditor may sue either on the \naccord or on the underlying debt (the greater amount).\n If you’re representing the creditor and the underlying debt is unliquidated \nor disputed, consider suing on the accord (the lesser amount), because that \namount has been established. If you sue on the underlying debt, the court  \nmay say you’re entitled to an amount that’s even less than the amount  \nagreed to in the accord.\n For example, suppose the parties entered into an accord to settle a disputed \n$10,000 debt for $8,000. If the debtor fails to perform (satisfy) the accord, then \nthe creditor can sue on the underlying debt of $10,000. But the debtor can raise \nthe dispute as a defense to that debt, and the creditor may end up recover -\ning less than $8,000. If the creditor sues on the accord of $8,000, however, the \ndebtor has agreed that that’s a liquidated and undisputed amount. The debtor \ncan’t raise a defense to payment, so the creditor should get judgment for $8,000.\n197  Chapter 12: Evaluating Whether Contract Modifications Are Enforceable\nDistinguishing accord and satisfaction \nfrom substituted contract\nWhen a debtor breaches an accord, the creditor may sue on the accord or \non the underlying obligation. This rule has one exception that seldom arises. \nSometimes the debtor claims that the creditor agreed to discharge the debt \nin return for the debtor’s promise  to pay a lesser amount, not for the debtor’s \npayment  of the lesser amount. Such an agreement is called a substituted con -\ntract because the new agreement presumably replaces the original contract. \nWhether the parties entered into an accord or a substituted contract is a \nmatter of interpretation, as I discuss in Chapter 11. The more reasonable \ninterpretation usually favors the creditor. To create a substituted contract, \nthe parties must be very clear that that was their intention.\n For example, a debtor says to a creditor, “I dispute owing you the $10,000 you \nclaim. I promise to pay you $8,000 in return for your agreement to discharge \nthe debt.” The creditor agrees. The debtor then fails to pay the $8,000, and the \ncreditor sues for $10,000. The debtor defends this claim by arguing that the \nconsideration for resolving the dispute was the debtor’s  promise to pay the \n$8,000, not the payment  of $8,000. Whether this falls under substituted con -\ntract or accord and satisfaction is a matter of interpretation:\n ✓ Substituted contract:  If the creditor said in effect, “I’ll accept your prom -\nise in exchange for my discharge of the debt,” then you’re looking at a \nsubstituted contract, and the creditor discharged the debtor from the \nunderlying debt as soon as he stated that promise.\n ✓ Accord and satisfaction:  If the creditor said in effect, “I’ll accept your \npayment  of $8,000 in exchange for my discharge of the debt,” then the \nparties have an accord, and the underlying debt is discharged only  \nwhen the debtor pays the $8,000.\nBecause a reasonable creditor is likely to discharge an underlying debt only \nupon payment of the new amount, courts lean toward interpreting agree -\nments like these to be accords unless evidence clearly shows that the parties \nintended to form a substituted contract.\n198 Part IV: Performing the Contract or Breaching It \nApplying the rule of UCC § 3-311  \nto settlements by check\nThe discussion of the UCC in this book is mostly confined to Article 1, \nDefinitions and General Provisions, and Article 2, Sale of Goods. Article 3 gov -\nerns negotiable instruments such as checks and includes a rule that governs \nan accord and satisfaction entered into by check. This provision will prob -\nably become less important as fewer and fewer transactions use checks, but \nit makes for a good review of the rules. The statute provides the following in \npart, as enacted in North Carolina at 25-3-311:\n  § 25-3-311. Accord and satisfaction by use of instrument.\n  (a) If a person against whom a claim is asserted proves that (i) that \nperson in good faith tendered an instrument to the claimant as full sat -\nisfaction of the claim, (ii) the amount of the claim was unliquidated or \nsubject to a bona fide dispute, and (iii) the claimant obtained payment \nof the instrument, the following subsections apply.One way to slash an electric bill: Con Edison v. Arroll\nIn Consolidated Edison v. Arroll , Arroll was a \ncustomer of Con Edison, which supplies elec -\ntricity to New Yorkers. Arroll thought his bill \nwas too high, so he sent Con Edison a check \nin partial payment along with an accompanying \nletter that explained the dispute and informed \nCon Edison that if they cashed the check, the \ndebt was settled. Con Edison cashed the check \nand sued for the balance due.\nArroll raised the affirmative defense of accord \nand satisfaction. Con Edison claimed that Arroll \ndidn’t prove that his bill was in error. The court \nagreed, but it found that Arroll had raised the \ndispute in good faith. Even if a claim isn’t a valid \nclaim, it’s consideration if raised in good faith.Con Edison then claimed that as a practical \nmatter, it has to process thousands of checks \nand can’t be bothered to sort out the ones that \nare sent to resolve a dispute. Too bad, said \nthe court. The same rules apply to you as to \neveryone else. You were on notice that if you \naccepted this check to resolve a disputed debt, \nthe debt would be satisfied.\nBefore you start sending checks in partial pay -\nments to all your creditors, realize that the debt \nis settled only if they accept a check that you \nsent in good faith to settle an unliquidated or \ndisputed debt.\n199  Chapter 12: Evaluating Whether Contract Modifications Are Enforceable\n  (b) Unless subsection (c) applies, the claim is discharged if the person \nagainst whom the claim is asserted proves that the instrument or an \naccompanying written communication contained a conspicuous state -\nment to the effect that the instrument was tendered as full satisfaction \nof the claim.\n  (c) Subject to subsection (d), a claim is not discharged under subsection \n(b) if either of the following applies:\n  (1) The claimant, if an organization, proves that (i) within a rea -\nsonable time before the tender, the claimant sent a conspicuous \nstatement to the person against whom the claim is asserted that \ncommunications concerning disputed debts, including an instru -\nment tendered as full satisfaction of a debt, are to be sent to a \ndesignated person, office, or place, and (ii) the instrument or \naccompanying communication was not received by that desig -\nnated person, office, or place.\n  (2) The claimant, whether or not an organization, proves that \nwithin 90 days after payment of the instrument, the claimant ten -\ndered repayment of the amount of the instrument to the person \nagainst whom the claim is asserted. This paragraph does not apply \nif the claimant is an organization that sent a statement complying \nwith paragraph (1)(i).\n  (d) A claim is discharged if the person against whom the claim is \nasserted proves that within a reasonable time before collection of \nthe instrument was initiated, the claimant, or an agent of the claimant \nhaving direct responsibility with respect to the disputed obligation, \nknew that the instrument was tendered in full satisfaction of the claim.\nSubsections (a) and (b) lay out the common-law rules of offer, acceptance, \nand consideration. Subsection (c) provides two rules that give the credi -\ntor an escape from an accord it entered under subsections (a) and (b). And \nsubsection (d) states a situation in which a party would not be allowed the \nescape under (c).\n ✓ Under subsection (a), this provision applies only when (1) the debtor \nsends a check, (2) the claim was unliquidated or subject to a good-faith \ndispute, and (3) the creditor accepted the offer by cashing the check.\n ✓ Under subsection (b), the accord is satisfied only if the debtor, on the \ncheck or in an accompanying communication, informs the creditor that \nthe check was offered in full satisfaction of the debt.\n200 Part IV: Performing the Contract or Breaching It \n ✓ Subsection (c) gives the creditor two escape routes. First, the creditor \nmay have informed the debtor that offers to enter into accords must be \nsent to a particular office. If the creditor did so and the debtor didn’t \ncomply, then the accord doesn’t discharge the debt. Second, if the \ncreditor doesn’t have such an office, it can return the debtor’s payment \nwithin 90 days of cashing the check to avoid the discharge of the debt.\n ✓ Subsection (d) removes the subsection (c) escape routes if the creditor \nknew that it was entering into an accord before receiving the check. In \nthis case, the partial payment discharges the debt.\nDoing away with consideration  \nby statute or case law\nMany authorities would like to see accord and satisfaction used even when \nconsideration for the settlement is missing. For example, if I owe you $10,000, \nyou may have perfectly good reasons to willingly discharge that debt in \nreturn for my payment of $8,000 even if I offered no consideration for the \nreduced amount. You may just want to cut your losses and be done with me, \nespecially if you think that collecting from me would be difficult. Therefore, \nmany jurisdictions, by statute or by case law, have established a mechanism \nfor discharging even a liquidated and undisputed debt. In such a case, care -\nfully follow the procedure established in your jurisdiction in order to effec -\ntively discharge the debt.",18301

70-Deciding Whether a Nonperforming Party Is in Breach.pdf,70-Deciding Whether a Nonperforming Party Is in Breach,"Chapter 13\nDeciding Whether Unforeseen \nEvents Excuse Performance\nIn This Chapter\n▶ Recognizing when unforeseen events excuse a seller’s performance\n▶ Excusing a buyer whose purpose was frustrated\n▶ Anticipating the possible outcomes of excused performance\n▶ Allocating risk with freedom of contract\nA \n party’s failure to perform isn’t breach if their nonperformance is \nexcused. If performance is subject to an express condition that doesn’t \noccur, then nonperformance is excused and doesn’t constitute breach (see \nChapter 14 for details). But even if a contract omits such a conditional clause, \nan unforeseen event that makes performance impossible or very difficult may \nexcuse nonperformance if a court reads that condition into the contract.\nThis chapter explains how courts decide whether certain events excuse  \nperformance, how the courts are likely to resolve issues that result from \nexcused performance, and how to draft clauses to allow and disallow \nexcused performance.\nDeciding Whether a Nonperforming \nParty Is in Breach\nCenturies ago, performance-excusing events had to be enumerated in the \ncontract: If an event wasn’t in the contract, its occurrence didn’t excuse non -\nperformance. Now the rule has flip-flopped, so contract law assumes that an \nunforeseen event excuses nonperformance unless the contract assigns the \nrisk that the event will occur to one of the parties.\n202 Part IV: Performing the Contract or Breaching It \n For example, most courts would agree that if a tornado wipes out the manu -\nfacturing plant of a seller who had promised widgets from that factory,  \nthe manufacturer would be excused from performance. The manufacturer  \nmay not be excused, however, if the contract stipulates something like \n“Manufacturer bears the risk if it is unable to perform because of tornado \ndamage to its manufacturing facilities.”\nWhen an unforeseen event occurs and the risk is not allocated in the con -\ntract, a seller may claim that the event has made performance impracticable  \n(impossible or unrealistic). To analyze a claim of impracticability, determine \nwhether the following four conditions are met:\n ✓ The event occurred after the contract was made.\n ✓ Performance became impracticable because of the event.\n ✓ The nonoccurrence of the event was a basic assumption of the  \nparties when they entered the contract.\n ✓ The party seeking to be discharged didn’t carry the risk of the  \nevent’s occurrence.\nThis section examines each of these factors in turn.\nDid the event occur after  \ncontract formation?\nFirst determine whether the unexpected event occurred before or after \nthe parties formed the contract. If the unknown, adverse condition already \nexisted at the time the parties made the contract, then the adversely affected \nparty may have a choice. That party could claim that the parties acted on a \nmistaken belief that may avoid the contract (provide a defense to contract for -\nmation). (See Part II for more about the mistake defense.) Alternatively, that \nparty could claim that the unexpected event discovered during performance \ndischarges him because of existing impracticability.\nThe main difference between these claims is conceptual. If a court finds mis -\ntake, then the contract is voidable. If the court finds that performance was \nimpracticable because of a fact that existed at the time of contract formation \nbut which the adversely affected party had no reason to know about, then \nthe parties have a contract, but the adversely affected party’s duty to per -\nform that contract never arose.\n203  Chapter 13: Deciding Whether Unforeseen Events Excuse Performance\nIf the event occurred after the parties made the contract, then you’re deal -\ning only with contract performance rather than formation, and supervening \nimpracticability  comes into play.\n Suppose a manufacturer agrees with the government to develop a superwid -\nget that has capabilities not shared by existing widgets. The manufacturer is \nunable to achieve the technological breakthrough required to perform and \nclaims relief from the contract. The manufacturer could claim relief either \nthrough mistake or impracticability:\n ✓ Mistake defense:  The manufacturer claims that both parties shared a \nbelief that was not in accord with the facts (that the breakthrough could \nbe achieved), and this basic assumption on which the contract was \nmade had a material effect on the exchange of performances. The  \ncase would come down to whether the adversely affected party,  \nthe contractor, bore the risk of that mistake.\n ✓ Existing impracticability:  The contractor claims that his performance \nis impracticable because of a fact he had no reason to know (the break -\nthrough could be achieved only at tremendous expense) and the non -\nexistence of which was a basic assumption on which the contract was \nmade. The case would come down to whether, under the circumstances, \nthe contractor bore the risk of such facts.\n The mistake defense may be easier to prove if the manufacturer can convince \nthe court that the parties shared a mistaken belief about the facts and not just \na mistaken prediction about the future. One problem with the impracticabil -\nity alternative is that courts may not excuse nonperformance merely because \nperformance turned out to be more expensive than anticipated. Obviously, \nthe best solution would’ve been to address the possibility in the contract.\nDid performance become impracticable?\n The UCC uses the term impracticability  to mean performance that’s not neces -\nsarily impossible but considerably more difficult than anticipated. When the \nevent occurs after the parties form a contract, the party claims that perfor -\nmance is considerably more difficult because of supervening impracticability.  In \nthese cases, the person adversely affected always admits contract formation \nbut claims that his duty is discharged due to the occurrence of a certain event.\nDetermining how hard performance has to be to constitute impracticability \nis somewhat subjective. If performance is destined to drive a company into \n204 Part IV: Performing the Contract or Breaching It \nbankruptcy, that’s probably enough to constitute impracticability. If a com -\npany’s performance merely means it won’t earn a profit from the exchange, \nthat’s probably insufficient reason to excuse its performance.\nA problem courts often face arises when a party claims that it should be \nexcused because an event dramatically increased the cost of its inputs. For \nexample, if I promised you cotton goods from my factory at a certain price \nand a flood prevents my factory from operating, clearly I’m excused from \nnonperformance. But what if a flood in cotton-growing regions drives up the \nprice of cotton? I’m still able to perform but at a dramatically higher price \nbecause it cost me more to buy the cotton I needed.\nOfficial Comment 4 to UCC § 2-615, which deals with Excuse by Failure of \nPresupposed Conditions, provides an answer that involves considerable  \nwaffling:\n4. Increased cost alone does not excuse performance unless the rise in \ncost is due to some unforeseen contingency which alters the essential \nnature of the performance. Neither is a rise or a collapse in the market \nin itself a justification, for that is exactly the type of business risk which \nbusiness contracts made at fixed prices are intended to cover. But a \nsevere shortage of raw materials or of supplies due to a contingency \nsuch as war, embargo, local crop failure, unforeseen shutdown of major \nsources of supply or the like, which either causes a marked increase in \ncost or altogether prevents the seller from securing supplies necessary \nto his performance, is within the contemplation of this section.\nOne way contract law limits the application of the doctrine is by asking not \nwhether this party, in its financial situation, is able to perform, but whether \nany objective, reasonable party would be able to perform. If another party \nwas able to perform under the same conditions, then performance wouldn’t \nbe excused.\n For example, because a downturn in cattle prices prevents a feedlot from \nbeing able to get credit, the feedlot is unable to continue feeding cattle \nunder the contract and claims that it’s excused. Contract law would say that \nalthough this party was unable to perform, another party in its place would’ve \nbeen able to perform, and the feedlot’s nonperformance is unexcused. On \nthe other hand, if the feedlot was unable to perform because of a government \nquarantine, then it would be excused because any party in that situation \nwould’ve been unable to perform.\n205  Chapter 13: Deciding Whether Unforeseen Events Excuse Performance\nWas nonoccurrence of the event  \na basic assumption?\nWhen figuring out whether nonperformance is excused, the most difficult \ndetermination is whether nonoccurrence of an event is a basic assumption of \nthe contract. Put yourself in the shoes of the parties at the time they formed \nthe contract. They didn’t address this situation in the contract, so contract \nlaw has to supply it for them. Ask whether the parties, when making the \nagreement, were likely to have thought that the event wouldn’t occur. If the \nanswer is yes, then nonoccurrence of the event was a basic assumption.\nThe kinds of events that qualify as basic assumptions and often excuse non -\nperformance are the sudden natural disasters that people often refer to as  \nacts of God  — flood, hurricane, tornado, earthquake, and so on. A govern -\nment action such as an embargo or quarantine is also an excusing event.\nIn some cases, courts use the foreseeability  test to determine whether nonoc -\ncurrence of an event was a basic assumption. Under this test, if the occurrence \nof an event isn’t predictable, then the nonoccurrence of that event is a basic \nassumption of the contract. However, this isn’t a very good test, because you \ncan easily demonstrate that just about any event was predictable.\n For example, I say, “Let’s put it in the contract that I’m excused if a meteorite \ndestroys my factory,” and you say, “That’ll never happen!” So we omit that \nclause from the contract and sign it. Five minutes later — Bam! — a meteorite \nhits my factory. The event was clearly predictable, because I said it might \nhappen. Technically speaking, it was foreseeable, but any reasonable person \nprobably wouldn’t consider that a foreseeable event.\n Because contract law is essentially trying to determine whether the law \nshould imply that a certain event excuses nonperformance, contracts expert \nAllan Farnsworth suggests looking at the parties’ situation when they entered \nthe contract and asking whether this was a risk that reasonably would be \nassumed. To solve the meteorite problem under this test, ask whether reason -\nable parties at the time they entered the contract would’ve expected perfor -\nmance if a meteorite later hit the seller’s factory. If the answer is no, then the \nnonoccurrence of that event was a basic assumption. Similarly, every farmer \nknows a drought is possible, but reasonable parties would intend that if a \ndrought wipes out a farmer’s crop, that farmer’s nonperformance is excused.",11354
71-Determining Whether a Buyers Purpose Was Frustrated.pdf,71-Determining Whether a Buyers Purpose Was Frustrated,"206 Part IV: Performing the Contract or Breaching It \nDid the party seeking to be  \ndischarged carry the risk?\n A frequent theme of contract law is the interplay of two rules:\n ✓ What’s reasonable:  This often supplies the default rule.\n ✓ What the parties agree to:  The parties often have the freedom of  \ncontract to change the default rule.\nThe interplay of these two concepts is evident in the area of impracticabil -\nity. Contract law can determine whether excusing a party’s nonperformance \nbecause of a certain unanticipated event is reasonable. Freedom of contract \nenables the parties to override that default rule. For example, a party gener -\nally bears the risk of rising or falling markets. In other words, circumstances \nhold the party to bear the risk. However, parties may use language in the \ncontract to protect themselves from certain risks (for details, see the later \nsection “Using Freedom of Contract to Allocate Risk”).\n In a number of cases, a farmer has promised, say, 50,000 pounds of toma -\ntoes to a buyer. An unanticipated event wipes out the farmer’s crop, but the \nfarmer isn’t excused. Why not? Because the farmer promised 50,000 pounds of \ntomatoes and not 50,000 pounds of tomatoes from his farm . Under this inter -\npretation, the farmer is still liable for performance and will be in breach if he \ndoesn’t obtain the tomatoes elsewhere. He should’ve put in the contract that \nthe tomatoes were to come from his farm. Similarly, if a seller relies on a cer -\ntain source of supply and that source of supply becomes unavailable, whether \nthe seller is excused depends on whether his getting the goods from that \nsource was a basic assumption of the contract. To make it clear, he should  \nput language to that effect in the contract.\nDetermining Whether a Buyer’s  \nPurpose Was Frustrated\nA seller may claim impracticability if he can satisfy all the elements: That is, \nafter contract formation, an unforeseen event made the seller’s performance \nimpossible or unrealistic, nonoccurrence of the event was a basic assump -\ntion of the contract, and the seller didn’t carry the risk of that event. A buy -\ner’s obligation, however, is usually to pay money. Lack of money is not  \nan excuse for nonperformance, because that’s a subjective factor. A buyer \nmay, however, be able to claim excuse because of frustration of purpose.\n207  Chapter 13: Deciding Whether Unforeseen Events Excuse Performance\nThe elements of frustration  are the same as the elements of impracticability, \nexcept that the party seeking to be discharged from the contractual obliga -\ntions must prove that a certain event frustrated the principal purpose of the \ncontract.  In the case of frustration, the party is able to perform, but the  \nperformance no longer holds any value for him.\n For example, in 1919, a tenant leases space from a landlord, intending to use \nthe space as a drinking establishment. Immediately afterward, the government \nenacts Prohibition, banning the sale of alcohol. An event has occurred, and its \nnonoccurrence was a basic assumption of the contract. The principal purpose \nof the contract has been frustrated because of the event, which clearly had a \nmaterial effect on the transaction. The duty of the tenant would be discharged \nunless he bore the risk under the language of the contract or under the cir -\ncumstances. The case would likely turn on whether a reasonable party under \nthe same circumstances would’ve known that Prohibition was likely.\n Frustration comes in handy to get a buyer off the hook when certain events \nundermine the buyer’s ability to reap the expected benefits of the exchange. \nClaiming impracticability is rarely an option, because buyers can’t claim that \ntheir nonperformance is excused by something like a natural disaster. After \nall, the buyer’s main obligation is to pay money — an act that’s easy to per -\nform even when serious events occur. In addition, subsequent events often \nplace the buyer at a disadvantage in the contract, and contract law doesn’t \nwant to provide the buyer with an easy exit just because she made a bad deal.\nFor a buyer, frustration is a better claim than impracticability, but the buyer \nhas to come up with a better claim than saying, “My principal purpose was \nto make money, and because I am no longer going to make money under this \ncontract, the purpose of it has been frustrated.”\nMany modern cases arise because of changing government regulations. For \nexample, if a particular crop is limited, such as through a quota of fish that \ncan be caught, then a person may buy a share of that quota. If the quota is \nthen lifted, the person’s purpose in obtaining that right has been frustrated \nby an event. As a result, his performance is excused.\n The case of Krell v. Henry  stands out as a clear case of frustration. The setting \nwas London in 1902, and Queen Victoria’s reign had finally ended with her \ndeath. Like Prince Charles today, Prince Edward had been sitting around for -\never singing “Oh I Just Can’t Wait to be King,” and finally he was going to have \nhis chance. A magnificent coronation parade was planned through London, \nand the route just happened to pass by Krell’s house, which afforded a great \nview of the procession. He advertised that his house was available for rental \non June 26 and 27, the days of the coronation parade. Henry saw the sign and \nstruck a deal to rent it on those days for £75.",5506
72-Figuring Out What Happens When a Partys Performance Is Excused.pdf,72-Figuring Out What Happens When a Partys Performance Is Excused,"208 Part IV: Performing the Contract or Breaching It \nThen disaster struck. Edward was stricken with appendicitis and the parade \nwas canceled. Henry expected to be released from the contract, but Krell \nrefused. He said in effect, “The house did not burn down. Nothing is stopping \nyou from renting it on June 26 and 27. Have a nice time!” Henry’s response, of \ncourse, was that although the contract could be performed, its principal pur -\npose had been frustrated, so performance no longer held any value to him. \nThe court agreed, and the modern view of frustration was born.\nFiguring Out What Happens When  \na Party’s Performance Is Excused\nWhen impracticability or frustration excuses a party’s performance, the \nparty is not in breach, so no damages are payable. But when a party suffers \na loss as a result of the nonperformance, that party may ask a court to make \nsome financial allocation. The law’s views on this have changed over time.\n For example, in Krell v. Henry  (refer to the preceding section), Henry had \nalready made a down payment when his performance was excused, and he \ndidn’t get it back. This was standard practice established by other coronation \ncases. The English courts decided in these cases to leave the parties where \nthey would’ve been under the contract at the moment the event occurred — if \nthe renter had made a down payment before the event occurred, he wouldn’t \nget it back, and if he was scheduled to make a payment before the event \noccurred, he’d have to pay it.\nThis result seems arbitrary, and its only advantage is that the rule is easy to \napply. Modern contract law has other, more-logical and messier approaches, \nas I explain in this section.\nUsing our old friends reliance  \nand restitution\nRestatement § 272 says that courts may use principles of restitution and reli -\nance to allocate the resulting losses when performance is excused. This solu -\ntion is fairer than leaving the parties where they are, but it’s fuzzy.\n For example, in Krell v. Henry,  a modern American court would undoubtedly \naward Henry restitution of his down payment and wouldn’t require further \nscheduled payments to be made. This solution makes a great deal of sense \nbecause the coronation parade will be rescheduled and Krell will have another \n209  Chapter 13: Deciding Whether Unforeseen Events Excuse Performance\nopportunity to rent out the house. He’d be unjustly enriched if he were able to \ncollect two rentals.\nCourts have awarded reliance to a party who reasonably prepared for per -\nformance before the event occurred, as when a contractor has spent money \nfor plans to work on a building and the builder’s performance is excused \nbecause of impracticability when the building burns down. Allocating the \nloss between the parties seems fair.\n Don’t call such an allocation of losses damages.  Damages are payments  \nfor breach of contract. When a party’s performance is excused, the party \nhasn’t breached.\nAllocating the loss when a performance  \nis partially excused\nWhen a party’s performance is excused but he still has some production \navailable to supply under two or more contracts, contract law needs a  \nrule for allocating the available supply among buyers. UCC § 2-615(b) pro -\nvides the rule, stating that “he may so allocate in any manner which is fair \nand reasonable.”\n For example, a farmer was expecting to produce 200,000 pounds of cotton \non his farm and agreed to sell 100,000 pounds from his farm to each of two \nbuyers. An unanticipated event limited his cotton harvest to 80,000 pounds. \nThe event excused his performance, so he’s not in breach, but under UCC  \n§ 2-615(b), he’s obligated to allocate his cotton crop in a fair and reasonable \nmanner. This doesn’t necessarily mean that he has to offer 40,000 pounds  \nto each buyer. One buyer may be a more established customer or have \ngreater need.\nBecause a natural disaster often drives up the prices of goods by making \nthem scarcer, the farmer may be able to get contracts to sell the cotton at \nprices higher than his original customers were bound to pay. Because the \nfarmer must act in good faith, however, he probably should not favor those \nprospective customers over his regular customers.\nOn the other hand, the buyers are under no obligation to accept less than \nthey bargained for. Under the mechanism of UCC § 2-616, the seller must \nnotify the buyer of the allocation. If the buyer affirmatively agrees, then the \ncontract is modified to the allocated quantity. But if the buyer wants, she \nmay terminate the contract, and if she doesn’t respond to the seller’s notice, \nher silence will be interpreted as terminating the contract.",4736
73-Using Freedom of Contract to Allocate Risk.pdf,73-Using Freedom of Contract to Allocate Risk,"210 Part IV: Performing the Contract or Breaching It \nUsing Freedom of Contract  \nto Allocate Risk\nInstead of letting a court decide after the fact whether a particular event \nexcuses nonperformance, parties can use their freedom of contract to add A peculiar ruling: ALCOA v. Essex\nIn the case of ALCOA v. Essex,  ALCOA prom -\nised to covert ore into aluminum from 1967 to \n1983. Knowing that conditions would change \nover the years during this long-term contract, \nALCOA consulted an expert, the noted econo -\nmist Alan Greenspan, to develop a formula for \nhow much it should charge each year. The \nresulting formula provided that the price ALCOA \ncharged would increase each year by the per -\ncentage the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) rose \neach year. That worked fine until 1973, when \nthe OPEC oil embargo drove up the price of oil, \nwhich is a key factor in the price of electricity, \nwhich is a major input in aluminum production. \nWhen the cost of electricity rose faster than \nthe WPI, ALCOA was stuck with a formula for \nthe price of its services that didn’t cover its \nexpenses. ALCOA calculated that it would lose \n$75 million over the remaining term of the con -\ntract. It sought to have its duty to perform the \ncontract excused under mistake, frustration, or \nimpracticability.\nALCOA won in the trial court on all three \ngrounds. The court found that the parties shared \na mistaken belief at the time they entered the \ncontract that the formula would accurately pre -\ndict the cost of production, and this turned out \nnot to be true. Therefore, the contract was void -\nable by ALCOA. (I don’t agree with that analy -\nsis, because I would’ve found that ALCOA had \nasked for the formula and therefore assumed \nthe risk of its not working out.)\nThe court also found impracticability and frus -\ntration. This situation is one of those cases where a party was able to perform but claimed \nit suffered hardship because of the additional \ncost of its inputs. The court was persuaded \nthat although increased cost doesn’t gener -\nally excuse performance, this was a dramatic \nincrease. The ALCOA  case is one of only a few \ncases where a seller was excused because of \nthe increased cost of its inputs.\nSimilarly, ALCOA claimed that its principal \npurpose in entering the contract was to make \nmoney and that this purpose was frustrated by \nthe unanticipated event. The court agreed, even \nthough loss of money has generally been held \nnot to excuse nonperformance. (Again, I don’t \nagree with that analysis, because I would’ve \nfound that ALCOA had assumed the risk of \nhigher costs.)\nFurthermore, having held that the parties had \nno contract because of mistake and that non -\nperformance was excused because of imprac -\nticability and frustration, the court then decided \nthat the remedy was to continue the contract \nwith a revised price formula that was more \nfavorable to ALCOA. Although parties frequently \nnegotiate such solutions for themselves, rarely \ndoes a court come up with a remedy that’s so at \nodds with traditional contract law.\nA trial court decided ALCOA v. Essex,  and the \nparties settled before an appellate court could \nreach its decision, so this case probably has \nlittle precedential value, but it is interesting as \nan outlier case that’s inconsistent with most of \nthe law in this area.\n211  Chapter 13: Deciding Whether Unforeseen Events Excuse Performance\na clause to the contract that enumerates the events that excuse nonperfor -\nmance. Such a provision is often called a force majeure  (“greater force”) clause. \nAlthough parties often incorporate an off-the-rack force majeure clause in the \nboilerplate provisions of their contract, you’re better off drafting a provision \nthat addresses the particular needs of the parties, as I explain next.\nDrafting a “force majeure” clause to  \nidentify events excusing nonperformance\nA force majeure clause usually identifies the events that excuse nonperfor -\nmance. One approach is to just state the default rule:\nSeller’s performance is discharged if seller is unable to perform in whole \nor substantial part because of events beyond its control.\n Unfortunately, such a clause offers no more protection than if the clause were \nomitted. To draft a solid force majeure clause, include the following elements:\n ✓ A list enumerating the most common events that excuse performance:  \nThis list may include natural disasters, such as fire, flood, hurricane,  \nand tornado.\n ✓ Language stating that the events listed “include but are not limited to” \nthose most common events:  If you merely enumerate the events, you \nleave the seller vulnerable to the rule of expressio unius est exclusio alte -\nrius (“expression of one excludes the other”), as I discuss in Chapter 11. \nThe fact that the parties listed other events but omitted “meteorite” indi -\ncates that they didn’t intend a meteorite strike to be an excusing event. \nBy adding “include but not limited to,” you cover other types of natural \ndisasters, including meteorite strikes.\n ✓ Language stating “whether the event is of the same class as the enu -\nmerated events or not”:  Including all natural disasters is better, but it \ndoesn’t protect the seller if his workers go on strike. If such an event \noccurred, the buyer could invoke another rule: ejusdem generis,  which \nmeans that the excusing events are “of the same kind” as the enumer -\nated items, and a strike is not the same as a natural disaster. Adding  \nlanguage that includes excusing events that are not in the same class  \nas the enumerated events protects against this rule.\n ✓ A price escalator to protect against changes in input costs:  A price \nescalator allows the seller to pass on the higher costs of its inputs  \nto the buyer.\nHere’s an example of a solid force majeure clause that incorporates the first \nthree elements:\n212 Part IV: Performing the Contract or Breaching It \nSeller’s performance is discharged if seller is unable to perform in whole \nor substantial part because of events beyond its control, including but \nnot limited to fire, flood, hurricane, or tornado, whether the event is of \nthe same class as the enumerated events or not.\nAnd here’s a portion of a price-escalator clause that allows the parties to \nadjust the terms if hardship results from the initial terms — for example, if \nthe price of an input increases:\nIf a new situation beyond the reasonable control of either party arises \nduring the term of this agreement, and if that situation results in a severe \nhardship to one party without an advantage to the other party, then the \nparties shall promptly consult to seek a mutually acceptable agreement \nthat deals with the situation.\nNo excuses: Drafting a “hell  \nor high water” clause\nIn theory, the parties could draft around the default rule and put in the con -\ntract a clause stating that performance is not excused even if unanticipated \nevents arise. In the Texas oil business, these are known as hell or high water \nclauses  because, as the expression goes, you have to perform come hell or \nhigh water. If an athlete or entertainer has a lot of bargaining power, she can \nget a term in the contract that provides that in addition to her nonperfor -\nmance being excused if she is unable to perform (for example, because of  \nan injury), she still gets paid in the event of that injury.",7470
74-Defining Condition in Legal Terms.pdf,74-Defining Condition in Legal Terms,"Chapter 14\nChecking for Conditional \nLanguage\nIn This Chapter\n▶ Grasping the basics of conditions\n▶ Recognizing express and implied conditions\n▶ Deciding who performs first and why it matters\n▶ Gauging substantial performance\n▶ Getting out of a condition\nA \nlmost all contracts contain at least one condition — an implied condi -\ntion that goes something like this: “If you don’t perform, I don’t have to \nperform, either.” Parties are free to add express conditions to their contracts as \nwell, such as “If payment in full is not received within 30 days of the billing date, \nfinance charges may begin to accrue at the maximum rate allowable by law.”\nParties generally use conditions to encourage performance by the other \nparty or to protect themselves when their ability to perform hinges on unpre -\ndictable future events, such as qualifying for a mortgage loan to purchase a \nhome. Parties may also try to use conditions to excuse their performance by \nsaying that their performance was conditional on the occurrence of a certain \nevent that never happened.\nThis chapter brings you up to speed on what conditions are (and aren’t). It \nthen explains how to use conditions to give your client more leverage in get -\nting the other party to perform a contract and how to use conditions to give \nyour client an escape hatch from the contract.\n214 Part IV: Performing the Contract or Breaching It \nDefining Condition in Legal Terms\nThe Restatement defines condition  as “an event, not certain to occur, which \nmust occur, unless its non-occurrence is excused, before performance under \na contract becomes due.” This definition is pretty clear, but sometimes \npeople confuse conditions with promises. To further muddy the waters,  \nconditions may be express  or implied.  This section helps clarify these  \nimportant distinctions.\n When people refer to the “Terms and Conditions” that govern a contract, \nthey’re usually referring to only the terms of the contract. Saying the “Terms” \nthat govern the contract is more precise because terms may be promises  \nor conditions.\nTelling the difference between  \na promise and a condition\nA term in a contract may be a promise, a condition, or both:\n ✓ Condition:  An event that must occur but isn’t certain to occur before \nsome performance is due\n ✓ Promise:  A commitment to do or refrain from doing something\n ✓ Both (sometimes called a promissory condition ): A commitment to do \nsomething that’s also an event that must occur before the other party’s \nperformance is due\n Suppose I agree to sell my Ted Williams autographed baseball to you for $400 \nif the Red Sox win this year’s World Series, and you agree to pay 30 days after I \ngive you the ball. This example contains all three types of terms:\n ✓ Condition:  One condition is the Red Sox’s winning the World Series. \nNeither party has promised to make this happen. It’s an event that has \nto occur, but isn’t certain to occur, before our performances are due.\n ✓ Promise:  You promise to pay me $400. You have a commitment to do \nthis. However, your payment isn’t an event that has to occur before my \nperformance is due, because I’ll already have performed.\n ✓ Both:  My promise to give you the baseball is a promissory condition. \nIt’s a promise because I have a commitment to do it, and it’s a condi -\ntion because it’s an event that has to occur before your performance of \npaying me the $400 is due.\n215  Chapter 14: Checking for Conditional Language\nThese distinctions have practical implications. Breach of promise gives \nthe non-breaching party only the right to seek damages, whereas breach \nof a promissory condition excuses the non-breaching party’s performance \n(because it’s conditional) and gives her the right to sue for damages (due  \nto the breach).\n Suppose I agree to sell you the baseball and you agree to pay me $400 for it (no \n30 days to pay, no winning the World Series condition). If I refuse to deliver the \nbaseball, you can refuse to pay me (not perform), buy one elsewhere for more \nmoney, and sue me for the extra money it cost you. Likewise, if you refuse to \npay me the $400, I can refuse to give you the baseball (not perform), sell the \nbaseball to someone else for less, and sue you for the difference.\n Making your client’s performance conditional can be powerful leverage to \nsecure performance from the other party. If your client extends credit, she \ngives up that leverage.\nNotice that if I agree that you can pay me $400 in 30 days in exchange for the \nbaseball instead of paying on delivery, I give up one of these rights: If you \ndon’t pay, I can still sue you, but I can’t refuse to give you the baseball (not \nperform), because I’ve already performed. By extending credit, I didn’t make \nmy performance conditional on your performance.\nYou may encounter vocabulary describing the promises as dependent  or  \nindependent.  Here’s the difference:\n ✓ A dependent promise  is conditional on the occurrence of some event, \nusually the performance of another promise.\n ✓ An independent promise  is unconditional — no event that has to occur \nbefore the promise must be performed.\n For example, in a separation agreement, a husband promises to pay $100 per \nweek child support, and the wife promises to give him weekend visitation with \nthe kids. One week, he doesn’t pay. The wife retaliates by saying he can’t have \nvisitation with the kids. She’s treating the promises as dependent  and claiming \nthat because he didn’t perform his promise, she doesn’t have to perform hers. \nBut as a matter of policy, courts say that these promises are independent  — \nshe has to perform even though he hasn’t performed. Note that she still has a \nremedy — she can recover damages for breach of contract.",5827
75-Deciding Who Must Go First.pdf,75-Deciding Who Must Go First,"216 Part IV: Performing the Contract or Breaching It \nDetermining whether a condition  \nis express or implied\nConditions are either express or implied:\n ✓ Express conditions:  Express conditions are those that the parties \ninclude in their contract by stating that some performance is conditional \nupon the occurrence of one or more events. An express condition is \neasy to detect. Look for words like if or it is a condition precedent that.  \nFor more about express conditions, see the next section.\n ✓ Implied conditions:  Implied conditions are found by a court. Under the \nrule of constructive conditions of exchange, courts generally find that \neach party’s performance is impliedly conditional on the other party’s \nperformance. To discover how courts find implied conditions, skip \nahead to “Determining Whether Courts Will Find an Implied Condition.”\n For example, assume that I say, “I’ll sell you my Ted Williams baseball for $400 \nif the Red Sox win the World Series this year,” and you agree to the deal. Our \ncontract has both types of conditions:\n ✓ The express condition is that I’ll sell you the ball only if the Red Sox win \nthe World Series. This condition is directly stated in our contract.\n ✓ The implied condition is each of our performances. I’m obligated to per -\nform if you perform, and you’re obligated to perform if I perform. These \nconditions aren’t stated in the contract; they’re implied.\nTapping the Power of Express Conditions\nExpress conditions are valuable in protecting a party from unforeseen \ncircumstances that may prevent her performance. Homebuyers often use \nexpress conditions when presenting a purchase offer to a seller; they may \nmake the offer on the condition that they’re able to sell their own house by \na certain date or that they’re able to secure a mortgage loan. If the specified \nevent doesn’t happen, the buyer doesn’t have to perform and isn’t in breach \nfor nonperformance.\n If a party has some control over the occurrence of the conditional event, he \nhas a good-faith duty to see that it occurs and not to prevent its occurrence.\n217  Chapter 14: Checking for Conditional Language\n For example, a homebuyer can’t agree to a purchase conditional upon secur -\ning a mortgage loan and then do nothing to secure that loan — the courts \nwon’t allow it. The buyer may say, “How can I be in breach? My offer was con -\nditional upon securing the loan, and that didn’t happen.” But because the \noccurrence of the condition was within the buyers’ control, a court will read \nin an implied promise based on the obligation of good faith, as I discuss in \nChapter 10. If the buyer had put a good faith effort into securing a mortgage \nloan and failed to accomplish that task, then the court would probably excuse \nthe buyer’s performance.\nDetermining Whether Courts Will  \nFind an Implied Condition\nIf the parties haven’t made performances expressly conditional, then a  \ncourt has to determine whether the contract contains implied conditions. \nThe biggie here is that each party’s obligation to perform is impliedly  \nconditional on the other party’s performance.\n To understand how and why this rule came into being, suppose I agree to \nsell you the baseball and you agree to pay me $400 for it. Before I give you \nthe baseball, you say to me, “Ha-ha! I’m not going to give you the $400.” I say, \n“Then I’m not going to give you the baseball.” You say, “I don’t see that in the \ncontract. The contract says that you promised me the baseball. It doesn’t \ncontain an express condition saying that if I don’t pay you the $400, then you \ndon’t have to give me the baseball.”\nYou would’ve been right until about 1775, but fortunately after that the law \nchanged to recognize the implied conditions that are called constructive \nconditions of exchange.  Under this sensible rule, if one party refuses to per -\nform, then the other party is excused from performance. I win the argument \nbecause the condition is implied as a matter of practicality. And because our \npromises are conditions as well, then if one party doesn’t perform, the other \nparty has two remedies:\n ✓ Refuse to perform because an implied condition to the other party’s  \nperformance didn’t occur.\n ✓ Recover damages for breach of promise.\n218 Part IV: Performing the Contract or Breaching It \nSorting Out Conditions Precedent, \nConcurrent, and Subsequent\nThe Restatement doesn’t differentiate between classes of conditions, but the \nrules of Civil Procedure and some commentators muck things up by catego -\nrizing conditions into three types:\n ✓ Condition precedent:  A condition precedent is an event that must occur \nbefore some promise has to be performed. For example, I agree that I \nwill sell you my baseball if the Red Sox win the World Series. This event \nmust occur before the promise has to be performed.\n ✓ Condition concurrent:  A condition concurrent is an event that must \noccur at the same time as a promise has to be performed, such as when \nI promise to sell you the baseball and you promise to pay me $400 for \nit. Each party’s performance is conditional on the other party’s perfor -\nmance, and the performances must occur at the same time.\n ✓ Condition subsequent:  A condition subsequent is an event that dis -\ncharges a duty to perform a promise. Conditions subsequent arise when \na person has a duty but an event that discharges  that duty (excuses the \nperson from performing it) occurs. Conditions subsequent arise most \nfrequently in insurance contracts. Suppose an insurer has the duty to \npay for losses you suffer in a fire. The duty to pay arises in the event of \na fire, but the policy may also say that the insurer’s duty is discharged if \nthe insured doesn’t give notice of the loss within 30 days from the date \nof the loss. If the event (failure to give notice within 30 days) occurs, it \nextinguishes the insurer’s duty. That event is a condition subsequent.\nThe distinction between conditions precedent and conditions subsequent \nmakes some difference in civil procedure, because a plaintiff has the burden \nof proving a condition precedent, whereas the defendant has the burden \nof proving a condition subsequent. For purposes of contract law, however, \nthese distinctions aren’t important. In the insurance example, whether the \ncontract stipulates a condition precedent (“It is a condition precedent to \nthe insurer’s duty to pay that the insured give notice within 30 days of the \nloss”) or a condition subsequent (“The insurer’s duty to pay terminates if the \ninsured does not give notice of the loss within 30 days”), the provision has \nthe same effect — the insured will not be able to recover if he doesn’t give \nnotice within 30 days of the loss. For this reason, contract law simply calls \nboth a condition.\n219  Chapter 14: Checking for Conditional Language\nWhen pleading conditions in the documents supplied to a court, both parties \nare obligated to state the conditions they think did or didn’t occur, but the \nobligation is different depending on whether you’re a plaintiff or a defendant. \nRule 9(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure states the following:\n(c) Conditions Precedent.\nIn pleading conditions precedent, it suffices to allege generally that all \nconditions precedent have occurred or been performed. But when deny -\ning that a condition precedent has occurred or been performed, a party \nmust do so with particularity.\nAccording to this rule, which most states use as well, the plaintiff must gener -\nally plead that all conditions have been satisfied, whereas the defendant must \npoint out the specific conditions that haven’t been satisfied and thus excuse \nits performance. This rule makes practical sense, because the plaintiff needs \nto know which conditions the other party is claiming excuse its performance.\n Suppose we’ve agreed that I’ll sell you my Ted Williams baseball for $400 if \nthe Red Sox win the World Series. If I sue you for breach, I have to put in my \npleading that “all conditions have been satisfied,” because the events that con -\nditioned your performance had to occur before your performance was due. \nOn the other hand, you have to inform me what your defense is going to be by \nalleging with particularity which conditions you’re claiming did not occur — \neither “The Red Sox didn’t win the World Series” or “Burnham didn’t offer to \ngive me the baseball” or both.\n Avoid using the phrase “breach of condition.” If a condition is an event,  then \nit can’t be breached — it either occurs or it doesn’t. Instead, say that a condi -\ntion has been satisfied  or not satisfied.  If the person had a duty to bring about \nthe event that had to occur before performance was due, then say, even \nthough it’s a mouthful, that there’s “breach of the promise to bring about the \ncondition” when that’s the case.\nDeciding Who Must Go First\nConditions create a lot of leverage, giving a party two ways to convince the \nnonperforming party to perform: (1) threaten to withhold performance and (2) \nthreaten to sue for damages. However, the non-breaching party loses its lever -\nage if it has already performed, so the party who performs first is at a disad -\nvantage. This section explains how courts decide who has to perform first.\n220 Part IV: Performing the Contract or Breaching It \nChecking out the default  \norder of performance\n By default, contract law says that both parties must perform at the same time, \nwhich gives each party leverage to ensure that the other party performs. \nIdeally, when I sell you the baseball, I hand it to you as you hand me the $400.\nExceptions arise when circumstances prevent the parties from exchanging \nperformances at the same time or when parties contract around the default \nrule. The main circumstance that prevents the performances from being due \nat the same time is that one performance, such as a service, may take time to \nperform, whereas the performance of payment can be done instantly. In these \ncases, the rule is that the performance that takes time must go first. This is bad \nnews for parties providing services, because they must perform before they’re \npaid; however, they can work around this rule, as I explain next.\nMaking agreements about  \nthe order of performance\nThe party who performs first is at a distinct disadvantage, so if your client \nhappens to be the party who has to go first, look for some way to reduce \nthe risk. Because contractors have to build the building (the performance \nthat takes time) before they get paid (the performance that can be done \ninstantly), contractors traditionally find ways to contract around this rule. \nContractors may have the benefit of statutory lien laws that give them a claim \nto the property they constructed to recover payment. In addition, contrac -\ntors often require “progress payments” — payments tied to certain mile -\nstones. Similarly, because lawyers have to perform first, they often require \nclients to pay a retainer  — an upfront payment so the lawyers don’t have to \nworry about getting paid after performing a service.\n Extending credit increases the creditors’ exposure to risk, because they give \nup the right to make their performance conditional upon payment. For exam -\nple, suppose I agree to sell you the baseball for $400 payable in 30 days. I have \nto give you the baseball now. If in 30 days, you don’t pay me, my only remedy \nis to sue for breach of promise to recover the $400 you owe me, but I don’t \nget the ball back. By extending credit, I relinquish my right to make my perfor -\nmance conditional on your performance.\n When your client extends credit for the sale of goods, be sure that the contract \ncontains language stating that your client has the right to repossess the goods \nif the other party fails to perform. If you omit that language, your client has no",11985
76-Determining Whether a Party Has Substantially Performed.pdf,76-Determining Whether a Party Has Substantially Performed,"221  Chapter 14: Checking for Conditional Language\nclaim to the goods, only to the payment. The main remedy for breach of con -\ntract is the non-breaching party’s right to the expectancy  — what they would’ve \nhad if the contract had been performed (see Chapter 16 for details). When I sell \nmy baseball for $400 with 30 days to pay and you don’t pay, I can claim only the \n$400, not the baseball. However, I can contract around this through the law of \nsecured transactions,  which allows the creditor to provide that if the other party \ndoesn’t perform, the creditor can repossess the property.\nDetermining Whether a Party  \nHas Substantially Performed\nAccording to the rule of constructive conditions of exchange, if one party \ndoesn’t perform at all, then the other party’s entire performance is excused. \nThat’s easy. What’s tough is determining whether performance of one party \nin part  excuses the other party’s performance. This is one of the tough -\nest questions in contract law, and it’s one your clients will frequently ask. \nContract law says that if a party commits a material breach,  then the other \nparty’s performance is excused. But if the breach is immaterial,  then the \nother party must still perform.\n For example, your client calls and says, “My contractor was supposed to build \nmy swimming pool to a depth of 9 feet, but he built it only 81⁄2 feet deep. I \ndon’t have to pay him, right?” Your client may not realize it, but he’s claim -\ning benefit of the rule of conditions — he thinks that because the other party \ndidn’t perform as specified in the contract, then he doesn’t have to perform, \neither. But if that were the rule, then people wouldn’t have to pay if they got \nanything less than perfect performance. The law doesn’t want that to happen \nbecause it would result in a lot of people getting a lot of stuff without having  \nto pay for it.\n To prevent a party from refusing to perform because of a minor breach by the \nother party, contract law created the rule of substantial performance.  This rule \nsays essentially that if a breach is immaterial,  then the party has substantially \nperformed, and we’ll pretend that performance was sufficient to satisfy the \nimplied condition that one party has to perform before the other party’s  \nperformance is due.\nIf you explained this to your client, he’d probably get impatient and ask, “So \ndo I have to pay him for the swimming pool or not?” Your client, of course, \ndoesn’t want to wait for an appellate court to tell him whether the contractor \nhas substantially performed — he wants to know now, from you. This section \nexplains various ways to make this determination.\n222 Part IV: Performing the Contract or Breaching It \nConsidering how the type of  \nbreach affects the outcome\nWhether a breach is material or immaterial matters because it determines \nhow a dispute is resolved:\n ✓ Immaterial breach:  An immaterial breach entitles the non-breaching \nparty to recover damages but doesn’t excuse that party’s performance. \nFor example, if a court found that the contractor had substantially per -\nformed the contract to build the swimming pool (committed an immate -\nrial breach), then the owner would have to pay for the pool but could \nrecover damages for the breach.\n ✓ Material breach:  A material breach means that the breaching party \ndidn’t substantially perform. Not only can the other party recover \ndamages, but their own performance is also excused. For example, if a \ncourt found that the contractor had not substantially performed, then \nthe owner wouldn’t have to pay for the pool under the contract. If that \nsounds like a harsh outcome for the contractor, contract law agrees \nwith you and has some ways to reduce the harsh effects of conditions. \nTo find out more about these methods, keep reading.\nRunning tests to find substantial  \nperformance\nIf I could predict when a court was going to find substantial performance, I’d \nbe a millionaire. Contract law has no reliable test, because each situation is \nso different, but this section explains a few tests you can run to make an  \neducated guess.\nThe mathematical test\nCourts often start their discussions of substantial performance by saying that \nno mathematical formula is available. Technically, that’s true, but dismissing \nthe math option entirely is baloney. A mathematical test is often a good place \nto start. To perform the mathematical test, look at the amount of perfor -\nmance as a percentage. If the performance is close to 100 percent, it probably \nconstitutes substantial performance. If a contractor completes 90 percent of \nthe work, that’s probably substantial, whereas 40 percent is not.\nHowever, the math test isn’t very useful in gauging quality and other subjective \nfactors. If a telescope lens has to be ground to precision and the manufacturer \n223  Chapter 14: Checking for Conditional Language\nclaims, “I only missed by a thousandth of an inch!,” that’s not close enough if it \nprevents the telescope from working. Likewise, if an asphalt roof is supposed \nto be a certain uniform color but it comes out multicolored and streaky, calcu -\nlating what part of the contract was performed is difficult.\nThe Cardozo test: Purpose served\nIn the famous case of Jacob & Youngs v. Kent,  Judge Cardozo said to look at \n“the purpose to be served, the desire to be gratified, the excuse for deviation \nfrom the letter, the cruelty of enforced adherence.” That’s an elegant mouth -\nful, but it makes sense. The “purpose served” looks at whether what the \nparty received serves the essential purpose of what was promised.\n For example, if you’re an ordinary swimmer, whether your pool is 9 feet deep \nor 81⁄2 feet deep would probably make little difference in the functioning of  \nthe pool — its “purpose to be served.” In addition, “the cruelty of enforced \nadherence” — saying that the owners don’t have to pay for it — would give \nthe homeowners a windfall at the contractor’s expense. As a result, a court \nwould likely find substantial performance.\n In the case of the streaky asphalt roof, even though the roof serves its purpose \nof keeping rain out of the house, the homeowner’s “desire to be gratified,” \nwhich probably meant getting a roof that was aesthetically pleasing, was not \nmet. As a result, a court would likely find no substantial performance.\n If what the party received serves the essential purpose of what was promised \nbut isn’t quite what was promised, the party not in breach is entitled to dam -\nages to make it right.\nThe Restatement test\nRestatement § 141 looks at a number of factors, similar to the Cardozo test, \nand it is similarly difficult to apply. These factors include the following:\n ✓ The extent to which the injured party is deprived of the promised benefit\n ✓ The extent to which the injured party can be adequately compensated \nby damages\n ✓ The extent to which the breaching party will suffer a forfeiture  (an out-  \nof-pocket loss)\n ✓ The likelihood that the breaching party will cure his failure\n ✓ The extent to which the breaching party failed to act in good faith\n224 Part IV: Performing the Contract or Breaching It \nThe Get Smart test\nOn the popular ’60s TV show Get Smart,  Agent 86 often explained that he \nonly “missed it by that much,” holding up his thumb and forefinger to show \njust how close he was. Maybe if a party misses only by that much, the breach \nshould be regarded as immaterial. I admit that this isn’t a very helpful legal \ntest, but it’s hard to come up with a test!\nDeciding whether a breach with  \nrespect to time is material\nParties often breach by failing to perform on time. The general rule is that \nstating a time for performance creates only a promise to perform at that time \nand doesn’t create an express condition. The Restatement defines condition  \nas an event that’s “not certain to occur,” and the passage of time is certain \nto occur. If we agree that I’ll sell you a baseball for $400 on November 1, then \nthe arrival of November 1 is not a condition to my performance; a promise to \nperform at a certain time is only a promise. If I deliver late, you can recover \ndamages for my late delivery, but you still have to perform.\n The parties are free to make performance on time an express condition. To do \nso, spell out the condition in the contract; for example, “If the baseball is not \ndelivered by November 1, then the buyer does not have to accept it.”\n Don’t use the stock phrase “Time is of the essence” to indicate that time is \nmaterial, because many courts see this as a shopworn phrase that has lost its \nlegal significance. Spell out the condition.\nA court may determine that the circumstances make performance on time an \nimplied condition. If I promised to tender the baseball on November 1 and \nstill haven’t delivered it a couple of months later, that’s probably a material \nbreach. Furthermore, circumstances may make even a short delay in perfor -\nmance material.\n If you own a bar, I promise ten kegs of green beer on March 16, and I deliver it \non the 18th, you can treat my nonperformance as though delivery on the 16th \nwere a condition. The circumstances made the delivery date material, because \na reasonable person in my shoes should’ve known that because March 17 is \nSt. Patrick’s Day, timely delivery was important in this case.",9460
77-Looking at Conditions in the UCC.pdf,77-Looking at Conditions in the UCC,"225  Chapter 14: Checking for Conditional Language\nSolving the problem by drafting  \nexpress conditions\n There’s no such thing as substantial performance of an express condition. \nExpress conditions require strict performance, because a condition is an \nevent — it’s either satisfied or not. The Red Sox will either win the World \nSeries or they won’t — missing it by that much  is irrelevant.\nBecause there’s no such thing as substantial performance of an express con -\ndition, one way around the problem of having a person get away with sub -\nstantial performance is to put an express condition in the contract. If having \na pool with a depth of 9 feet is important to you, then put in the contract, “If \nthe pool is not nine (9) feet deep, then the owner does not have to pay for it.”\nThe courts have ways of getting around even express conditions, as I explain \nin the later section “Excusing Conditions,” but they can’t use substantial per -\nformance to do so.\nLooking at Conditions in the UCC\nThe rules in UCC Article 2 are in practice very similar to the common-law rules. \nThe UCC contains an express rule of constructive conditions of exchange. The \ndefault rule is that the performances are due simultaneously, so the obligation \nto pay is conditioned on tender of the goods, and the tender of the goods is \nconditioned on payment. Of course, frequently the buyer and the seller are at \nsome distance from each other, and unless the seller arranges for delivery to \nbe C.O.D. (Cash on Delivery), someone is going to have to go first — usually \nthe buyer. As a result, the buyer takes on more risk.\nAs in common law, parties are free to contract around these rules and customs \nor use third-party payment services, such as PayPal, to reduce risk. Parties may \nalso limit their exposure to risk by using an escrow service, which is common in \ninternational business transactions. With an escrow service,  a third party such \nas a bank holds the buyer’s funds and releases them to the seller only after the \nseller has performed.\nAlthough the rules in UCC Article 2 are similar to common-law rules that \napply to conditions, note the two important exceptions I explain next.\n226 Part IV: Performing the Contract or Breaching It \nRule § 2-601: Making a “perfect tender”\nUCC Article 2 doesn’t appear to have the rule of substantial performance, \nso if the seller fails in any respect to fully perform, the buyer seems to be \nexcused from performance and pretty much call the shots. Section 2-601,  \nas codified in North Carolina at 25-2-601, provides:\n  Buyer’s rights on improper delivery.\n  Subject to the provisions of this Article on breach in installment con -\ntracts (G.S. 25-2-612) and unless otherwise agreed under the sections \non contractual limitations of remedy (G.S. 25-2-718 and 25-2-719), if the \ngoods or the tender of delivery fail in any respect to conform to the  \ncontract, the buyer may\n  (a) reject the whole; or\n  (b) accept the whole; or\n  (c) accept any commercial unit or units and reject the rest.\nThis rule is known as the perfect tender rule  because it appears to say that \nthe slightest defect in goods or delivery (even a few minutes late) excuses \nthe buyer’s performance. If read that way, sellers couldn’t claim substantial \nperformance, because only perfect tender would create a condition to the \nbuyer’s obligation to accept and pay for the goods.\nFortunately, few courts have enforced the rule as written. They avoid abuse \nby using principles such as good faith (being honest and reasonable, as I \nexplain in Chapter 10). For example, if a buyer receives goods a day late but \nsuffers no loss because of the delay and rejects them only because the con -\ntract price is higher than the market price, courts are likely to find that the \nrejection was not in good faith — the buyer didn’t reject them because they \nwere late.\n Because of the many exceptions found by courts, you’re probably safe to  \nread the perfect tender rule as requiring the buyer to accept the goods —  \nbut allowing him to recover damages — in the event of the seller’s  \nsubstantial performance.\nRule § 2-612: Dealing with  \ninstallment contracts\nThe UCC rule on installment contracts is useful for understanding how the \nCode expects parties to behave. The default rule under the Code is that the",4380
78-Excusing Conditions.pdf,78-Excusing Conditions,"227  Chapter 14: Checking for Conditional Language\nseller must deliver the goods in a single shipment. But the parties are free to \ncontract around that rule by agreeing to an installment contract. According \nto UCC § 2-612(1), an installment contract  is “one which requires or authorizes \nthe delivery of goods in separate lots to be separately accepted.”\nA problem may arise when the parties agree to an installment contract and \nthe seller materially breaches with respect to one of those installments. \nDepending on the situation, a buyer may become so annoyed with the seller \nthat she not only rejects the installment but also cancels the rest of the con -\ntract, saying that she didn’t want the other installments.\nNot so fast, says the Code. Although the buyer can clearly reject an install -\nment under § 2-601 when the seller materially breaches its obligations with \nrespect to that installment, the buyer can’t necessarily cancel the rest of the \ncontract. The buyer must first determine whether the breach with respect  \nto one installment “substantially impairs the value of the whole contract,” in \nthe words of § 2-612(3). If the seller is in breach with respect to one install -\nment, the Code wants the parties to try to work it out rather than end their \nrelationship immediately.\nBut how can the buyer determine whether the seller will perform in the \nfuture after a breach in delivering one installment? One technique the buyer \ncan use is to demand assurances from the seller, as I discuss in Chapter 15. A \nparty who received a nonconforming delivery may reasonably feel insecure \nabout subsequent deliveries. If the concerned party makes a demand for \nadequate assurances and doesn’t get them, then she can regard the  \ncontract as canceled.\n For example, if a seller of chicken has promised to deliver broilers (young \nchickens) in installments and the first installment is stewing chicken (older \nchickens), the buyer can’t necessarily cancel the contract. But the buyer can \nreject that installment and deliver a letter to the seller demanding assurances \nthat the seller will deliver broilers in the remaining installments. If the seller \ndemonstrates an ability to deliver broilers, the contract is back on track. If the \nseller says in effect, “You’ll get what you get,” then the buyer can probably \ncancel the contract.\nExcusing Conditions\nCertain conditions, express or implied, may cause hardship. For example, if \na contractor builds 80 percent of a house and a court finds that the contrac -\ntor didn’t perform substantially, then the owner doesn’t have to pay for the \nhouse. Obviously, such a ruling would cause the builder extreme hardship \nand give the homeowner an unfair windfall. To avoid the “cruelty of enforced \n228 Part IV: Performing the Contract or Breaching It \nadherence” of certain conditions, express or implied, the courts have sev -\neral methods to provide relief: interpretation, restitution, divisible contract, \nwaiver, and excuse of condition. This section explains these methods so you \nknow what to expect and can put them to use in representing your clients.\nFinding promise: Interpreting  \nyour way out of a condition\nIf an express condition causes hardship, courts frequently declare that the \nlanguage allegedly creating the condition is ambiguous and interpret it as a \npromise rather than a condition. That way, the non-breaching party must still \nperform and can claim only damages resulting from the breach.\n For example, suppose a contractor contracts with an owner to do some \nwork. The contractor then contracts with a subcontractor to do a portion \nof the work. The contract between the contractor and the subcontractor \nprovides, “Contractor will pay subcontractor when owner pays contractor.” \nThat sounds reasonable, but what happens if the owner doesn’t pay the con -\ntractor? The contractor may tell the subcontractor, “I don’t have to pay you \nbecause your payment is conditional on my receiving payment, and that didn’t \nhappen.” This would create a hardship for the subcontractor, who wouldn’t \nget paid for his work.\nA court is likely to find that “when” is not language of condition under which \nthe subcontractor took the risk of not getting paid. Rather, it would interpret \nthe agreement to mean that the contractor promised to pay the subcontrac -\ntor for the work and also promised to pay him at a reasonable time.\n To avoid problems of interpretation, use clear language when writing contracts.\n ✓ To create a condition:  Use “if” or “on condition that” or “it is a condition \nprecedent to A that B occur.”\n ✓ To create a promise:  Use “shall” or “has an obligation to” or “agrees to.”\n For example, an insurance company contract provides that “the owner must \ngive notice within 30 days of the loss.” The owner gives notice on the 32nd \nday, and the insurance company claims that the condition is not satisfied. \nA court could say that “must” means “shall” and the owner only breached a \npromise, so the insurance company still has to perform. To prevent this out -\ncome, the lawyers for the insurance company could change the language to \nsomething like, “If the owner does not give notice within 30 days of the loss, \nthen the insurance company’s duty to pay for the loss is excused.” It would be \nhard to argue that that language doesn’t create an express condition.\n229  Chapter 14: Checking for Conditional Language\nUsing restitution when a  \ncondition bars recovery\nWhen one party is unjustly enriched at the expense of the other party, restitu -\ntion requires that the unjustly enriched party disgorge  (relinquish) the benefit, \nreturning the enriched party to the position he was in before the benefit was \nconferred (see Chapter 4 for details). Restitution can be very useful when a \nfailure to substantially perform results in nonpayment under the contract. \nRestitution enables the breaching party to recover for the partial performance.\n For example, if a contractor conferred a substantial benefit on the owner, like \nbuilding 80 percent of the project, then the contractor could claim payment \nfor the benefit conferred in restitution. A century ago, many courts didn’t \nfavor restitution in this situation because the courts didn’t recognize claims \nfrom parties who didn’t have clean hands, such as dirty contract-breakers. \nToday, however, the prevailing view is that even the breaching party may \nrecover restitution.\nThe remedy for restitution starts with the value of the benefit conferred, \nwhich contract law can measure in a number of ways. But remember that  \nthe remedy for breach of promise by the non-breaching party comes before \nrestitution for the breaching party. In other words, a court deals first with  \nthe breach and then with restitution.\n Here’s an example of how restitution works:\n 1. A contractor builds 50 percent of a $200,000 house and quits.\n 2. The owner refuses to pay the contractor because the contractor didn’t \nsubstantially perform.\n 3. The contractor claims $100,000 in restitution.\n 4. The owner has a claim for damages for breach, which comes before res -\ntitution. So you need to look at what the homeowner has to pay to get \nthe house completed before you determine how much the contractor is \nentitled to in restitution:\n  • If the owner has the house completed at a cost of $110,000, then \nthe contractor can’t recover more than $90,000 in restitution \nbecause the owner bargained to pay $200,000 total for the house:\n   $200,000 – $110,000 = $90,000\n  • If the owner is able to get the house completed at a cost of $90,000 \n(for a total of $190,000 rather than $200,000), then the restitution \nwould be limited to no more than the portion of the contract that \nwas completed, which is 50 percent of $200,000, or $100,000.\n230 Part IV: Performing the Contract or Breaching It \nThe restitution argument is unnecessary in Code contracts. Section 2-607 of \nthe UCC states that “The buyer must pay at the contract rate for any goods \naccepted.” So if a store orders 100 shirts at $20 each and the seller delivers \nonly 80 shirts, the buyer is free to accept or reject the shirts or a portion of \nthem, but it has to pay for any shirts it accepts under the contract at a price \nof $20 per shirt.\nFinding a divisible contract\nA divisible contract  is one in which the parties agree that a part performance \nby one party is the “agreed equivalent” of some part performance by the \nother party. In sorting out performance disputes, a court may look at such  \na contract as a series of minicontracts, enforcing a contract claim for the  \npart performed.\n For example, suppose I was going away for 30 days and agreed to pay you $20 \nfor each day you fed and walked my dog ($600 total). You did it for 20 days \nand then bailed, so I had to find someone else to do the job for the remaining \ntime. You materially breached, so I could claim that I owe you nothing. But \ncontract law would look at this as 30 contracts for $20 each and would likely \nfind that you performed 20 of those contracts, so you’d have a claim for $400 \nunder the contract. But remember that the expectancy of the non-breaching \nparty comes before any claim by the breaching party. If I had to pay someone \nelse $25 a day for the remaining 10 days, that would come to $250 + $400 = \n$650 or $50 more than the $600 I would’ve paid had you fully performed, so \nthe maximum you could claim would be $600 – $250 = $350.\n If parties have a contract that’s broken up into parts, that doesn’t necessarily \nmean that those parts are agreed equivalents.\n For example, suppose that you mastered contracts through your study of \nContract Law For Dummies  and agreed to tutor a first-year student for the \n14-week semester for $420. You provide tutoring for two weeks and then decide \nto do something else with your time. You materially breached, so the tutee, \nshowing that she learned something about implied conditions, says she doesn’t \nhave to pay you anything. You claim that this is a divisible contract — essen -\ntially 14 contracts to provide tutoring for $30/week. You performed two of those \nmini-contracts, so she owes you $60. Your tutee, however, would have a good \nclaim that a week of tutoring and payment of $30 were not necessarily agreed \nequivalents — some weeks, particularly toward the end of the semester, may be \nmore demanding, and others, such as during a break, may be less demanding. \nShe’d argue that the contract was entire  rather than divisible. If she’s successful \nin that argument, then you’d have to fall back on a claim for restitution.\n231  Chapter 14: Checking for Conditional Language\nClaiming waiver to excuse a condition\nA waiver  is a knowing relinquishment of a legal right. Waivers often arise \nwhen a party has a right to treat a nonperformance as triggering a condition \nbut the party doesn’t do so. The waiver may lead the nonperforming party \nto believe that nothing terrible will happen if she doesn’t perform exactly as \npromised, and this justifiable belief may bar the other party from exercising \nhis right in the future. Note that a waiver arises by the conduct of the parties, \nso it’s not a contract modification, which I discuss in Chapter 12.\n For example, a consumer takes out an auto loan and promises to pay the \nlender a certain amount of money on the first day of the month for the next \n24 months. The contract contains an express condition stating that if the \nconsumer doesn’t pay on the first of the month, then the lender may acceler -\nate the loan  (call the entire amount due) and repossess the car if the con -\nsumer doesn’t pay the entire balance due. The consumer makes the first five \npayments on the 5th of the month, and the lender does nothing. When the \nconsumer makes the next payment on the 5th, the lender exercises its right \nto accelerate and repossess. A court will likely find that because the lender \nrepeatedly failed to exercise the right, the borrower was lulled into thinking \nthat the lender wouldn’t exercise that right.\nBecause a waiver arises by conduct rather than agreement, a party may retract \na waiver by giving the other party proper notice. The lender can send the con -\nsumer a “No More Mr. Nice Guy” letter clearly informing the consumer that \nif future payments are not made on the 1st, the lender will exercise its con -\ntractual rights. This letter would retract the waiver, and the consumer can no \nlonger claim that she didn’t know the importance of timely payment.\nThrowing yourself on the mercy of  \nthe court to excuse a condition\nWhen all else fails, a party who didn’t satisfy a condition can ask the court \nto excuse the condition. Courts do this reluctantly and only when the party \nhas suffered a forfeiture  (an out-of-pocket loss), as the wishy-washy rule from \nRestatement § 229 explains:\n§ 229. Excuse of a Condition to Avoid Forfeiture\nTo the extent that the non-occurrence of a condition would cause dispro -\nportionate forfeiture, a court may excuse the non-occurrence of that con -\ndition unless its occurrence was a material part of the agreed exchange.\nThis section explains a couple of applications of this rule.\n232 Part IV: Performing the Contract or Breaching It \nInsurance cases\nCourts apply excuse of a condition to avoid forfeiture most frequently in \ninsurance cases.\n Consider an insurance company that put in a fire-insurance policy an express \ncondition that if notice is not given in 30 days, it won’t pay for the loss. \nSuppose a policy owner gave notice on the 32nd day. None of the other forms \nof relief for avoiding the harsh effect of conditions would apply, but the court \nmay excuse this condition because the owner will suffer a forfeiture — he \nwould’ve paid his premiums for nothing.\nThe Restatement qualifies this rule with the language “unless its occurrence \nwas a material part of the agreed exchange.” In other words, the court looks \nat how important the condition was to the party who imposed it.\nFor example, an insurance company may put in its contract that it won’t pay \nfor a business’s fire loss “if the business does not install a sprinkler system.” \nThe business makes a claim for fire loss, and the insurance company refuses \nto pay because the business didn’t install a sprinkler system. Here, it seems \nthat the condition was material — very important for the insurance company \nbecause a sprinkler system probably would’ve reduced the fire damage and \nthe cost to the insurance company. The insurance company could make the \nsame argument if in the previous example, the owner gave notice not on the \n32nd day but on the 332nd day. The condition is less likely to be excused \nbecause the insurance company is harmed if it can’t investigate within a  \nreasonable time from the loss.\n Conditions can give you powerful leverage to get the other party to perform. \nIf the insurance company had put in the contract that the business promised \nto install a sprinkler system, then in the event of loss, the insurance company \nwould still have to pay but could recover damages for breach of promise. \nInstead, it put in the contract that installation of a sprinkler system is a condi -\ntion to its payment. Which method do you think would best induce the busi -\nness to perform?\nJacob & Youngs v. Kent\n The case of Jacob & Youngs v. Kent  demonstrates the difficulty the courts face \nin sorting out promises and conditions. Jacob & Youngs, Inc., was a contractor \nthat agreed to build a mansion for Mr. Kent. The contract contained numer -\nous specifications, one of which was that “all wrought-iron pipe must be well \ngalvanized lap welded pipe of the grade known as ‘standard pipe’ of Reading \nmanufacture.” When the house was completed, Kent discovered that the pipe \nwas made by the Cohoes company rather than by the Reading company.\n233  Chapter 14: Checking for Conditional Language\nKent claimed that he wanted the house rebuilt with the correct pipe, and he \nalso refused to make the final payment under the contract, which was about \n5 percent of the price. His first claim sounds like a breach of promise — if \nJacob & Youngs promised him a house with Reading pipe, that’s what he \nshould have, even if it meant demolishing most of the building to get it. His \nsecond claim sounds like a condition — because Jacob & Youngs failed to \nperform an express condition, he didn’t have to pay for the house.\nDuring the trial, Jacob & Youngs offered evidence that Cohoes pipe was just \nas good as Reading pipe, but the trial judge excluded this evidence, presum -\nably because it was irrelevant. If Reading pipe was a condition, then it didn’t \nmatter that some other performance was just as good, because the condition \nwasn’t satisfied.\nOn appeal, Judge Cardozo said that “considerations partly of justice and \npartly of presumable intention” should be used to determine whether a term \nis a promise or a condition. He didn’t think that reasonable parties in this \nsituation could seriously have meant that performance of every single speci -\nfication was to be a condition. Therefore, Jacob & Youngs had only promised  \nto use Reading pipe. This conclusion drove the dissent crazy, because it \nappeared that the parties had drafted the term as an express condition.\nBut even if it was a promise, the contractors might still have materially breached \nthe promise, and material breach would operate as the nonoccurrence of a \ncondition, excusing Kent’s performance. But Cardozo found the equivalent \npipe served the purpose and that Jacob & Youngs had acted innocently. This \nalso drove the dissent crazy, because Jacob & Youngs could not possibly have \ninstalled that much pipe without knowing what they were doing.\nEven if it was only an immaterial breach, Kent would still be entitled to dam -\nages and, as I explain in Chapter 18, courts generally award money damages \nrather than order the party in breach to fix the problem. Kent would’ve been \nvery happy to recover the amount of money it would take to tear out the \nReading pipe and put in new pipe in order to give him what he was promised. \nBut Cardozo wasn’t going to let him get away with that — everyone knows \nthat Kent wouldn’t really use the money for that purpose but would gain \na windfall at the expense of the contractors. So Cardozo instead awarded \nhim the difference in value between what he was promised — a house with \nReading pipe — and what he got — a house with Cohoes pipe. Because they \nwere equivalent pipe, that amount was zero.\nAlthough Cardozo undoubtedly thought Kent was a chiseler trying to get \naway with something, the dissent was concerned that this opinion would \nopen the floodgates for contracting parties to cut corners and get away with \nnot giving owners what they promised. However you feel about that, parties \nhave learned at least two practical lessons from this case:\n234 Part IV: Performing the Contract or Breaching It \n ✓ If you’re a contractor, don’t promise to use a particular brand name, and \nin case you forget, include in the contract that if any brand is named in \nthe contract, it’s only to establish a level of quality.\n ✓ If you really want something to be a condition, spell it out clearly. I have \nno doubt that if the contract had said in big letters, “If Jacob & Youngs \ndoesn’t use Reading pipe, then Kent doesn’t have to make the final pay -\nment,” the court would’ve enforced that understanding.",19655
79-Recognizing the Two Types of Anticipatory Repudiation.pdf,79-Recognizing the Two Types of Anticipatory Repudiation,"Chapter 15\nBreaching the Contract by \nAnticipatory Repudiation\nIn This Chapter\n▶ Understanding the two types of anticipatory repudiation\n▶ Knowing when a party can and can’t revoke a repudiation\n▶ Recognizing when a party has repudiated\n▶ Discovering what happens when a party repudiates\nR \nepudiation  arises when a party refuses or fails to perform the entire \ncontract. Anticipatory repudiation  occurs when a party refuses or \nimplies a refusal to fully perform before the performance deadline, thus \nbreaching the contract.\nGranted, calling anticipatory repudiation a breach isn’t exactly logical, \nbecause by definition, breach doesn’t occur unless a party fails to perform \nby the agreed upon deadline. If I have an obligation to deliver 1,000 widgets \nto you on August 1, and then on July 1, I say to you, “I’m not going to deliver \nthose widgets,” I could claim that logically I can’t be in breach, because on \nJuly 1, I can’t possibly have failed to perform my obligation to deliver the \nwidgets by August 1.\nNevertheless, for practical reasons, contract law calls this act a breach. \nContract law recognizes that if we treat my refusal as a breach on July 1, we \nmitigate the negative consequences that would be likely to arise if you had to \nwait until August 1 to order replacement widgets.\nHowever, you need to be careful in claiming breach. Because you can’t take \naction unless I’ve breached, you must first determine whether I’ve actually \nrepudiated in the eyes of the law. This chapter explains how to recognize \nwhen a party has repudiated, whether a party may revoke a repudiation, and \nwhat you can expect when one of your clients or a party your client has con -\ntracted with repudiates before the performance deadline.\n236 Part IV: Performing the Contract or Breaching It \nRecognizing the Two Types of \nAnticipatory Repudiation\nAnticipatory repudiation may be expressed or implied. In other words, one \nparty may refuse to perform his obligation either by his words or his actions.\nAn express repudiation  arises when one party verbally (in speech or writing) \ninforms the other party that he clearly and unequivocally refuses to perform. \nMy saying on July 1, “I’m not going to deliver those widgets that I promised \nto deliver on August 1” would probably cut it. But in order to discharge my \nduties (as I explain in Chapter 14), the repudiation must be material. If  \na party substantially performs at the time performance is due, it’s not a  \nmaterial breach.\n To determine whether the repudiation is material, ask yourself, “If the breach \noccurred at the time for performance, would it excuse the other party?” If the \nanswer is yes, you’re dealing with a material breach. The same rule applies to \nanticipatory repudiation. A breach prior to the performance deadline isn’t an \nanticipatory repudiation unless it’s a material breach.\n If I say on July 1, “I absolutely, unequivocally am going to deliver only 995 of \nthe 1,000 widgets I promised on August 1,” this doesn’t qualify as a repudiation, \nbecause it’s not sufficient to excuse you from performing your obligation — it \nwouldn’t rise to the level of material breach if that was the performance I gave \nyou on August 1.\nAn implied repudiation  arises when a party does something that puts the \npower to perform out of his control, even if he doesn’t say anything. If I have \na contract to sell my house to you on August 1, and on July 1, you find out I \nsold it to someone else, that’s clearly a breach by anticipatory repudiation. I \ndidn’t expressly inform you of my intention, but selling my house to someone \nelse implied repudiation. My actions speak even though I’m silent.\n The case of Taylor v. Johnston  nicely illustrates both implied and express \nanticipatory repudiation. Taylor, who owned two racehorses, both mares, \ncontracted with Johnston, who owned the great stallion Fleet Nasrullah, for \nstud services in California. Johnston then sold the horse to new owners in \nKentucky. This constitutes an implied repudiation, because Johnston relin -\nquished his power to perform. Instead of accepting the repudiation, Taylor \nprotested and persuaded Johnston to retract the repudiation by getting the \nnew owners to perform the contract for him (see more on retraction in the \nsection “Deciding whether the breaching party can retract the repudiation”). \nSo now the contract was back on track.\n237  Chapter 15: Breaching the Contract by Anticipatory Repudiation\nIn Kentucky, however, Taylor got a runaround. Whenever he made a reserva -\ntion for the services of Fleet Nasrullah, the new owners canceled it at the last \nminute. After this happened numerous times, Taylor became convinced that \nhe wasn’t going to get the services before the breeding season ended, so he \nfinally sought other stud services. When that didn’t work out, he sued.\nThe court noticed that the contract called for services during the year 1966 \nand couldn’t understand why Taylor had given up in June, when six more \nmonths remained in the year. But both parties explained to the court that in \na contract for stud services in the thoroughbred-racehorse world, the word \n“year” means “the breeding season of the year.” (This is a great example \nof how trade usage replaces ordinary meanings when the parties are in the \ntrade, as I explain in Chapter 11.)\nThe California Supreme Court held that there was no express anticipatory \nrepudiation because Johnston had not made “a clear, positive, unequivocal \nrefusal to perform.” Therefore, Taylor was the breaching party. This decision \nstrikes me as outrageous, because I think a reasonable person in Taylor’s \nshoes would’ve concluded that he wasn’t going to get the services. But it does \nreinforce an important lesson: Be careful about canceling a contract until \nyou’re sure that the other party has repudiated, either expressly or impliedly.\nDe La (European) Tour: The rule on  \nanticipatory repudiation is born\nThe rule on anticipatory repudiation was estab -\nlished in Anglo-American law by the landmark \ncase of Hochster v. De La Tour,  decided by the \nQueen’s Bench of England in 1853. In April of \n1852, De La Tour hired Hochster to accompany \nhim on a trip around the European Continent for \nthree months, beginning on June 1. When De \nLa Tour told Hochster on May 11 that he didn’t \nrequire his services, Hochster wasted no time \nand sued on May 22. De La Tour claimed that \nHochster couldn’t claim damages until after he \nhad held himself ready to perform on June 1.\nThe court had some precedent that involved \nimplied repudiations where the breaching party \nhad put itself out of its power to perform, but the court didn’t recognize a distinction between the \ncases. The court said, “It seems strange that \nthe defendant, after renouncing the contract \nand absolutely declaring that he will never act \nunder it, should be permitted to object that faith \nis given to his assertion.”\nThe court seemed particularly impressed with \nthe economics of the situation. It didn’t make \neconomic sense for Hochster to sit around, \nwaiting to see if De La Tour was going to change \nhis mind. It made more sense for Hochster to \nseek alternate employment during that time, \nbecause money earned from the alternate \nemployment would reduce his damages, thus \nbenefiting De La Tour.",7421
80-Determining Whether a Party Has Repudiated.pdf,80-Determining Whether a Party Has Repudiated,"238 Part IV: Performing the Contract or Breaching It \nDetermining Whether a  \nParty Has Repudiated\nRecognizing anticipatory repudiation in the real world isn’t always easy. \nPeople don’t always state their intentions in a clear and unequivocal manner. \nThey make statements like, “The market price of widgets is going up. I’m \nnot sure I’m going to be able to deliver those widgets you ordered at the old \nprice after all.” Or they may not say anything but demonstrate through their \nactions an unwillingness or inability to perform; for example, a buyer may \nhear from other buyers that the seller has failed to deliver to them, causing \nconcern that the seller may not perform as promised.\nThe problem is that remarks and rumors like these are not clear and unequiv -\nocal refusals to perform. If you treat these somewhat ambiguous signs as \nrepudiation and refuse to perform, then you run the risk of becoming the \nrepudiating party.\nSituations such as these present a dilemma. Say you’re a seller who has \nagreed to sell on credit, giving the buyer 30 days to pay after delivery. You \nhear that the buyer hasn’t been paying other creditors. This makes you reluc -\ntant to deliver to the buyer, but because the buyer hasn’t actually repudi -\nated, if you refuse to deliver the goods as promised, you take the chance of \nbecoming the repudiating party.\nContract law has come up with a cool solution to this dilemma, as this  \nsection explains.\nInsecurity and assurances: Using UCC  \n§ 2-609 to identify repudiation\nThe UCC has come up with an elegant solution to the fuzziness that often \naccompanies repudiation. The solution goes something like this:\n 1. One party has reasonable grounds for insecurity.\n 2. The insecure party demands written assurance from the other party.\n 3. If the insecure party receives adequate assurance, then the contract is \nback on track. If the insecure party doesn’t receive adequate assurance, \nthen the party who demanded assurance may treat the contract as repu -\ndiated by the other party and cancel the contract.\n239  Chapter 15: Breaching the Contract by Anticipatory Repudiation\nThis procedure provides a way to turn wishy-washy expressions into the \nsame certainty a party has when they receive an express repudiation.\nHere’s the official word from the Code found in § 2-609, as enacted in North \nCarolina at § 25-2-609:\n§ 25-2-609. Right to adequate assurance of performance.\n(1) A contract for sale imposes an obligation on each party that the oth -\ner’s expectation of receiving due performance will not be impaired. When \nreasonable grounds for insecurity arise with respect to the performance \nof either party the other may in writing demand adequate assurance of \ndue performance and until he receives such assurance may if commer -\ncially reasonable suspend any performance for which he has not already \nreceived the agreed return.\n(2) Between merchants the reasonableness of grounds for insecurity and \nthe adequacy of any assurance offered shall be determined according to \ncommercial standards.\n(3) Acceptance of any improper delivery or payment does not prejudice \nthe aggrieved party’s right to demand adequate assurance of future  \nperformance.\n(4) After receipt of a justified demand failure to provide within a reason -\nable time not exceeding thirty days such assurance of due performance \nas is adequate under the circumstances of the particular case is a repu -\ndiation of the contract.\nThe following subsections explain what constitutes reasonable grounds for \ninsecurity and how to go about demanding and getting reasonable assurances.\nFinding reasonable grounds for insecurity\nA party can demand assurances only if they have “reasonable grounds for \ninsecurity.” Note that either party can use this device — a buyer concerned \nabout performance or a seller concerned about payment. In typical Code \nfashion, subsection (2) explains that “Between merchants the reasonable -\nness of grounds for insecurity . . . shall be determined according to commer -\ncial standards.” The Code assumes that merchants, as people in business, \nhave determinable (objective) standards for what they consider reasonable. \nExamples of reasonable grounds for insecurity may include a case in which \na buyer hasn’t paid the seller for a previous order or the seller has reliable \nreports that this buyer has failed to pay other sellers.\n240 Part IV: Performing the Contract or Breaching It \nDemanding and getting adequate assurances\nAssuming that a party has reasonable grounds for insecurity, she has the \nright to demand adequate  assurances. The definition of what’s adequate, \nhowever, can be elusive. Use the following guidelines to determine what the \ncourt is likely to consider to be a reasonable demand for adequate assur -\nances and what qualifies as adequate assurances:\n ✓ Reasonable demand:  A reasonable demand for adequate assurances is \ntypically a demand for an explanation of\n  • The circumstances that gave rise to the insecurity\n  • How the circumstances have changed\n  • How the party plans on making good on its promise\n  The insecure party can’t use this situation as an excuse to completely \nrewrite the contract in its favor. A seller who extends credit, for exam -\nple, has taken some risk, and to demand an assurance of payment on \ndelivery would probably go too far.\n ✓ Adequate assurances:  Adequate assurances given in response to the \ndemand typically consist of an explanation of\n  • The circumstances that gave rise to the insecurity\n  • How the party has resolved or is in the process of resolving these \nissues and plans to honor the terms of the contract\n  If a buyer hasn’t paid, for example, reasonable assurances may consist \nof explaining how the situation arose and why the seller can now expect \npayment. A statement from the buyer’s bank might be helpful.\n If the insecure party has delivered a proper demand and the other party \nhas given no assurances or has given inadequate assurances, then the party \nmaking the demand may treat the contract as repudiated and cancel  the con -\ntract, declaring that the contract ended because of the other party’s breach.\n The case of AMF Inc. v. McDonald’s  is a good example of how UCC § 2-609 \nworks. In late 1968 and early 1969, McDonald’s (yes, that McDonald’s) ordered \n23 cash registers of a new design from AMF to be delivered by January 1970. \nIn March 1969, executives from the two companies held a meeting at which \nMcDonald’s expressed concern that insufficient progress was being made \non the development of the cash registers. In May, they met again, and AMF \nfailed to alleviate the concerns that McDonald’s had raised. Shortly thereafter, \nMcDonald’s canceled the contract.\n241  Chapter 15: Breaching the Contract by Anticipatory Repudiation\nAMF claimed that McDonald’s was the breaching party, because they had \ncanceled the contract in July of 1969, even though the delivery date was in \nJanuary of 1970. McDonald’s claimed they were justified in canceling the con -\ntract because of AMF’s anticipatory repudiation in spite of the fact that AMF \nhad never absolutely and unequivocally refused to perform.\nUnable to prove an express repudiation, McDonald’s claimed that they had \nsatisfied the elements of § 2-609. The court found that McDonald’s had rea -\nsonable grounds for insecurity because of AMF’s production problems, that \nMcDonald’s had made a demand for assurances at the March meeting, and that \nAMF had failed to give them adequate assurances at the May meeting. This \nlooked pretty good for McDonald’s in establishing that AMF had repudiated the \ncontract, but one element of the statute was not satisfied: McDonald’s had not \nmade its demand for assurances in writing,  as required by the statute.\nThe judge in the case found this element satisfied under the language from  \n§ 1-103(a) that the Code “must be liberally construed and applied to promote \nits underlying purposes and policies.” On the one hand, this doesn’t make a \nlot of sense, because even under the most liberal construction, “in writing” \ndoesn’t mean “not in writing.” On the other hand, the purpose of the writ -\ning requirement is probably to make clear to the other party that a serious \ndemand has been made that has legal consequences if they don’t respond. \nThe two meetings in March and in May probably served that purpose. In \nother words, little doubt exists that McDonald’s had informed AMF of their \nconcerns and expected action to be taken, and that AMF knew about the  \nseriousness of the matter.\nApplying the rule to the common law\nIn most jurisdictions, the common law follows the Code rule that addresses \nrepudiation. Some jurisdictions may have established the common-law equiva -\nlent of UCC § 2-609, found in Restatement § 251. Sometimes even if the Code isn’t \napplicable to a situation because it doesn’t involve the sale of goods, a court \nnevertheless analogizes  to the Code. In other words, the court may say that the \nCode has a good rule that should be followed even in non-Code situations.\n Suppose that during the spring, the dean of a law school hears that a profes -\nsor who’s under contract has been looking for jobs at other law schools. \nConcerned about having the position filled by the time the school year begins, \nthe dean demands assurances from the professor. The professor responds, \n“The semester starts on August 25, dean. Peek into my office at that time. \nEither I’ll be there or I won’t.”",9601
81-Figuring Out What Happens after Repudiation.pdf,81-Figuring Out What Happens after Repudiation,"242 Part IV: Performing the Contract or Breaching It \nThis situation clearly involves personal services, so the Code doesn’t apply, \nbut the rule seems to make sense in this situation. The law school has infor -\nmation that raises reasonable grounds for insecurity about whether the pro -\nfessor will perform his contract for the next year. Finding out in the spring, \nwhen lining up a replacement would be easier and cheaper, seems to make \nmore sense than waiting until August when the professor’s absence is likely \nto be disruptive. If I were a judge in that jurisdiction, I would analogize to the \nCode to come up with a rule for this common-law case that’s similar to the \nCode rule. Based on the rule, I would find that the professor failed to provide \nadequate assurances and hence repudiated his contract.\n The purpose of the demand for assurances is to find out whether a party’s \nequivocal statements or actions constitute a repudiation. If the party has made \nan express or implied repudiation, demanding assurances is unnecessary.\nFiguring Out What Happens  \nafter Repudiation\nAfter a party repudiates, any of the following events may occur in response \nto that repudiation:\n ✓ The repudiating party retracts the repudiation.\n ✓ The injured party accepts the repudiation and seeks remedies for  \nthe breach.\n ✓ The injured party ignores the repudiation.\nThis section explains these three events and their consequences in detail.\nDeciding whether the breaching  \nparty can retract the repudiation\nWhen one party repudiates, the other party usually gets a little miffed. If I \nagree to sell my house to you and then inform you, after you just sold your \nhouse, that I have no intention of selling to you, you’re likely to get more than \na little irritated. You’re probably not going to say, “Oh, okay, I guess I just \nneed to find another house in a hurry.” More likely, you’ll yell, threaten legal \naction, and employ other tools of persuasion to convince me to change my \nmind and retract  (take back) my repudiation.\n243  Chapter 15: Breaching the Contract by Anticipatory Repudiation\n Retracting a repudiation is a good thing because it puts the contract back on \ntrack, so contract law allows dirty, lowdown contract-breakers to retract their \nrepudiations with two exceptions. A party can’t retract a repudiation after the \nother party has done one of the following:\n ✓ Made clear that they accept the repudiation\n ✓ Relied on the repudiation\n So if after I told you I wasn’t going to deliver the widgets on August 1 as prom -\nised, you told me, “You’re so unreliable. I’ll never deal with you again,” then \nI can’t retract the repudiation later. Similarly, if the day after my repudiation \nI tell you that I’ve decided to perform after all, you’re free to tell me, “Sorry, I \nalready ordered replacement widgets from someone else.” Your reliance on \nmy repudiation keeps me from retracting even if I didn’t know about it before I \ntried to retract.\nSeeking remedies for the breach when the \ninjured party accepts the repudiation\nWhen a party breaches by anticipatory repudiation, the non-breaching party \ncan bring suit for breach of contract right then; she doesn’t need to wait \nuntil the performance deadline passes. The UCC in § 2-610 states that the \n“aggrieved party may (a) for a commercially reasonable time await perfor -\nmance by the repudiating party; or (b) resort to any remedy for breach.”\nActing in “a commercially reasonable time”\nIn UCC § 2-610, the reference to “a commercially reasonable time” shows the \nCode’s sense of reality. The non-breaching party doesn’t usually immediately \naccept the repudiation but may try to work things out with the repudiating \nparty. Thus, the reasonable time is a time in which the non-breaching party \ncan look around for alternative ways of obtaining performance while trying to \nget the repudiating party to retract.\nHowever, the non-breaching party runs a risk if she waits beyond that rea -\nsonable time to obtain a remedy. Often a seller repudiates because prices \nare rising and he could get more money for his goods from other buyers. If \nthe aggrieved buyer waits too long before obtaining goods in the market, \nthen if prices continue to rise, she may not be taking reasonable steps to \nmitigate the damages, which is an important principle of contract damages \n(see Chapter 16). The same thing can happen, of course, if a buyer repudiates \nbecause of a falling market.\n244 Part IV: Performing the Contract or Breaching It \n In Oloffson v. Coomer,  the plaintiff, a grain dealer, contracted on April 16 with \nCoomer, a farmer, to buy 20,000 bushels of corn on October 30 and another \n20,000 bushels on December 15 at a price of about $1.12 per bushel. On June 3, \nwhen the price of corn was $1.16 per bushel, Coomer informed Oloffson that \nhe wasn’t going to plant corn and that Oloffson should obtain it elsewhere. \nOloffson insisted that Coomer perform and kept badgering him for months, \neven though Coomer had clearly not planted corn. Finally, Oloffson purchased \ncorn on the delivery dates at prices of $1.35 and $1.49 per bushel and sued \nCoomer for the difference between those prices and the contract price.\nThe court correctly held that Oloffson had waited way past “a commercially \nreasonable time” before he covered  (found an alternative source for the \ncorn). Because Coomer had clearly repudiated on June 3, Oloffson should’ve \ncovered soon after that date. His damages were limited to the difference \nbetween the market price on that date and the contract price.\nCanceling a contract and excusing performance\nBecause anticipatory repudiation requires a material breach, the non-breaching \nparty may cancel the contract when the repudiation occurs. This is an exception \nto the rule of constructive conditions I explain in Chapter 14. Under that rule, \na party must tender performance in order to satisfy the condition that had to \noccur before the other party’s performance was due. But an anticipatory repu -\ndiation by one party excuses the other from tendering its performance.\n For example, I had a client who was an author. In his files he found a contract  \nhe had made with a publisher a number of years earlier in which he promised  \nto write a book for them. Under the rule of the order of performances (see \nChapter 14), he would be obligated to perform first by writing and submitting \nthe book, and then the publisher would publish it and pay him royalties. I wrote \na letter to the publisher, enclosing a copy of the contract and informing them \nthat he planned to submit the book. Without considering the consequences, they \nwrote back, declaring that he was performing too late and they no longer wanted \nthe book! This was an express anticipatory repudiation, with two consequences: \n(1) it discharged my client’s obligation to write the book, and (2) it allowed us to \nsue for damages immediately. All without having to write the book!\nIf the publisher had simply ignored my letter, my client would’ve had to write \nthe book and submit it. But because the publisher repudiated, my client \ndidn’t have to write the manuscript. However, if we then sued the publisher \nfor breach, they’d defend by claiming that their performance was excused \nbecause the author committed material breach first by not delivering the \nbook in a timely manner.\n245  Chapter 15: Breaching the Contract by Anticipatory Repudiation\nIn either scenario, we’d need to prove that the author didn’t breach. The big \ndifference is that due to the anticipatory repudiation, the author doesn’t have \nto submit the manuscript.\nRepudiating a contract that includes installment payments\nThe rule that a material breach allows the other party to cancel the contract \nhas one important exception. It comes into play when a party repudiates after \nreceiving everything he was supposed to get in exchange for his performance. \nThe exception usually arises in the context of a loan. A borrower receives full \nperformance when she gets the money from the lender. If the borrower agreed \nto pay back the lender in installments, her anticipatory repudiation doesn’t \npermit the lender to sue at that time for the entire balance.\n Suppose I lend you $10,000, and you promise to pay back $500 per month. \nLater, you tell me, “I’m not paying you this month and am never paying you \nback!” Even though this sounds like an express anticipatory repudiation, I  \ncan sue you for only the $500, because your duty at that time was to pay that \none installment.\n When writing a contract that includes installment payments on behalf of the \nparty who will be receiving payments, consider adding an acceleration clause. \nAn acceleration clause  provides that if the borrower defaults on one payment, \nthen the lender has the right to accelerate the entire amount, declaring it \nimmediately due and payable.\nIgnoring the repudiation: Not the best option\nIgnoring a party’s repudiation is the worst course of action for the non-  \nrepudiating party for two reasons:\n ✓ As long as the non-breaching party hasn’t accepted or relied on the \nrepudiation, the repudiating party can revoke the repudiation.\n ✓ Even if the repudiation eventually results in breach, the non-breaching \nparty may be limited to the damages it could’ve recovered if it had acted \npromptly after the repudiation.\n246 Part IV: Performing the Contract or Breaching It",9528

Courts are vigilant to ensure that the non-\nbreaching party is compensated, but not overcompensated, for the breach. \nTherefore, courts don’t award punitive damages for breach of contract, \nbecause punitive damages don’t compensate for a loss. Courts compensate \nthe non-breaching party in three ways:\n ✓ Expectancy:  The principal remedy is to award the non-breaching party \nmoney damages that give him the financial equivalent of what he would \nhave gotten had both parties performed — no more, no less. Courts \nrarely force the breaching party to perform (however, exceptions do \nexist in unusual circumstances, as I discuss in Chapter 18).\n ✓ Reliance:  Reliance is compensating the non-breaching party for out-of-\npocket expenses incurred in anticipation of having whatever the breach -\ning party had promised.\n ✓ Restitution:  Restitution involves requiring the breaching party to  \ndisgorge  (return) the value of any benefit he received from the non-\nbreaching party.\n250 Part V: Exploring Remedies for Breach of Contract \nThis chapter addresses these three basic common-law remedies for breach \nof contract and explains how the courts limit damages for breach. This infor -\nmation makes you better equipped to pursue what your client is entitled \nto or to limit what your client is required to pay when breach occurs. (In \nChapter 17, I explain the equivalent of these remedies as established in UCC \nArticle 2. And in Chapter 18, I present additional information about remedies, \nincluding equitable remedies,  where the court orders a party to perform or \nnot to do something, and the parties’ ability to change the rules.)\nMastering the Rule of the Expectancy\nAccording to the rule of the expectancy  or expectation damages,  compensa -\ntion for breach should put the non-breaching party in as good a position as \nshe would’ve been in if both parties had performed the contract. The rule \nof the expectancy isn’t just about compensating a party for what she actu -\nally lost out of pocket. It’s about compensating a party for the loss of the \nexpected benefit from the exchange.\n To use the rule of the expectancy to calculate damages, take the following steps:\n 1. Describe what the non-breaching party would’ve had if both parties \nhad performed the contract.\n 2. Describe where the non-breaching party stands now.\n 3. Figure out what it would take to bring the non-breaching party from \nwhere she is now to where she would’ve been had both parties  \nperformed.\n For example, suppose I promise to sell you my car for $10,000. If the car is \nactually worth $10,500 and I breach before you’ve paid me, here’s how the \nrule of the expectancy would apply:\n 1. Had the contract been performed, you would’ve had a car worth $10,500 \nfor the price of $10,000 — an addition of $500 to your net worth.\n 2. You still have your $10,000, but you don’t have the $10,500 car.\n 3. You’d need $500 to put you from where you are now (having an asset worth \n$10,000) to where you would’ve been (having an asset worth $10,500).\nIf you choose, you could buy a car equivalent to the $10,500 car I promised \nto sell you, and you’d have to pay $10,500 to buy it. So if I give you $500, then \nyou’re exactly where you would’ve been had I performed — you have a com -\nparable car and are out $10,000. The bottom line is this: Whether you replace \nthe car or not, I’d owe you $500.\n251  Chapter 16: Examining How Courts Handle Breach of Contract\nHowever, if the car were worth only $10,000, your expected gain from the \nexchange would be $0, and the court would award you nothing. Likewise, if \nthe car were worth only $9,500, you would’ve had an expected loss of $500 \nfrom the exchange and wouldn’t be eligible for damages. In fact, I did you a \nfavor by breaching!\n Contract law is interested in compensating the party who lost something \nbecause of the breach. It’s not interested in punishing a party for breaching  \na contract.\nThe following subsections explain how the expectancy plays out in common \nscenarios, how courts account for additional expenses when calculating dam -\nages, and how economists view breach as a good thing.\nSeeing the expectancy in context\nYou can develop a better understanding of the rule of the expectancy by \nseeing how it plays out in particular situations, such as construction and \nemployment contracts. To give you a better sense of how the courts are \nlikely to apply the rule in each situation, I provide examples for both in  \nthis section.\nChecking out a construction contract\n A builder agrees to build a house on an owner’s lot for $200,000. The builder \nplans to spend $190,000 on labor and materials and to make a profit of $10,000. \nAs soon as the parties sign the contract and before the builder has lifted a \nfinger, the owner breaches and says she doesn’t want the house built after all. \nThe builder is entitled to damages of $10,000 for breach of contract because \nthat’s what he would’ve had if both parties had performed the contract. It \ndoesn’t matter that he hasn’t actually spent any money — the expectancy is \nwhat he would have had.  He would’ve had $200,000 from the owner, but he \nwould’ve needed to spend $190,000 to get it, so the amount he expected to \ngain is $10,000.\nNow assume that the builder has started work and has built almost half the \nhouse at a cost of $90,000. If the owner breaches at this point, a court would \nhave to award the builder $100,000 to give him the expectancy — the amount \nrequired to bring him from where he stands now (out $90,000) to where he \nwould’ve been if both parties had performed the contract (having a profit \nof $10,000). Of course, in real life, this example would be messier, because \nthe builder would have to prove that he would’ve had a profit of $10,000 and \nthat he actually spent $90,000. In law school, however, you have the luxury of \nassuming facts and then discussing the law as it applies to the given facts.\n252 Part V: Exploring Remedies for Breach of Contract \nIf the builder breaches, computing the damages is more difficult. At this \npoint, the owner finds another builder to complete the job. Based on what \nthe second builder charges, the courts make sure that the owner gets her \nhouse built at a cost of $200,000. If the initial builder breaches immediately \nafter the parties enter into the contract and the second builder reasonably \ncharges $210,000 to do the same work, the owner is eligible for $10,000 in \ndamages. If she pays the second builder $210,000 and then recovers $10,000 \nfrom the first builder, she has exactly what she bargained for — a house  \nfor $200,000.\nIf the builder breaches midway through, after incurring expenses of $90,000, \nthe analysis is similar. The owner generally finds another builder to complete \nthe house, and contract law awards the owner any damages necessary to \ngive her the expectancy — getting the house built at a cost of $200,000. A \ncomplication, however, is whether the builder can recover for the expenses \nincurred (the $90,000). This recovery would not be damages for breach of \ncontract. I discuss the builder’s remedies in the section “Deciding whether \ndirty contract-breakers should get restitution,” later in this chapter.\nExamining an employment contract\n Assume an employer hires an employee to work for one year for $100,000. The \nemployer immediately discharges the employee without cause (if there were \ncause  for the discharge, the employee would be the one who breached the \ncontract). The employee would’ve had $100,000 if both parties had performed \nthe contract, so that’s the amount the employee would presumably be entitled \nto as damages.\nNotice that the breach leaves the employee free for a year. If the employee \nlands another job that earns him $75,000 during that year, the employee is \nawarded damages of $25,000 ($100,000 – $75,000). This amount of money \nbrings the employee to where he would’ve been (receiving $100,000) had \nboth parties performed the contract.\n Contract law expects the employee to work during that year and not just sit \naround watching reruns of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  So contract law requires \nthe employee to mitigate  — to find other work that will reduce the damages \nthe employer must pay. For more about mitigation, see “Asking whether the \nnon-breaching party mitigated the loss,” later in this chapter.\nIf the employee breaches the contract, the employer is entitled to its  \nexpectancy — an employee who would perform that job for a year for $100,000.  \nSo if the employer has to pay someone $110,000 to do the job, the employer \nis entitled to $10,000, because that’s the amount it would take to put the \nemployer in the position it would’ve been in had both parties performed \n253  Chapter 16: Examining How Courts Handle Breach of Contract\nthe contract. Of course, if the employer finds someone willing to do the job \nfor $100,000, it suffers no damages. Breach of contract claims aren’t very \ncommon in such cases because losses don’t often result from breaches.\n In an employment contract, if the employment is “at will” (no specific term), \nthen either party can terminate the agreement without breach. But if the \nemployment is for a term, then a party who terminates the agreement without \ncause is in breach.\nAccounting for expenses\nWhen calculating the damages that a plaintiff may be eligible for, make sure \nthat your client accounts for expenses, or transaction costs,  which usually \ninclude the costs of bringing a claim. In many cases, however, the transaction \ncosts exceed the damages, and the plaintiff may not be entitled to recover \nthese costs. These facts often keep the plaintiff from filing a claim. Consider \nthe following costs:\n ✓ Out-of-pocket costs for finding suitable performance:  If the plaintiff \ncan document reasonable costs associated with procuring whatever the \nbreaching party promised but failed to deliver, you can add those costs \nto the damages for breach of contract. However, contract law doesn’t \nlike parties to claim amounts they can’t document. In other words, a \nplaintiff can’t expect the defendant to pay for her “time and trouble.”\n ✓ Costs established by civil procedure statutes:  Civil procedure statutes \nmay entitle a party, typically the prevailing party, to recover costs, but \nthey’re usually only minor costs, such as the cost of serving a summons, \nfiling an action, or conducting depositions. Eligible costs don’t include \nthe biggest expense of bringing a lawsuit: hiring an attorney.\n Under the so-called American Rule, each side pays its own attorney’s fees — \nwin or lose — which may discourage a party from bringing a claim because \nshe may not come out ahead even if she wins. The English Rule is even more \ndiscouraging: If you lose, you have to pay the winner’s attorney’s fees, along \nwith your own. This rule would certainly discourage the little guy from taking \non a giant corporation.\nThe American Rule has two exceptions:\n ✓ Some statutes provide for attorney’s fees.  Examples are state consumer \nprotection acts and numerous federal consumer protection statutes. \nIf you can bring the claim under such a statute instead of bringing a \ncommon law or UCC claim, you may be able to recover attorney’s fees.\n254 Part V: Exploring Remedies for Breach of Contract \n  Sometimes statutes that provide for attorney’s fees essentially enact the \nEnglish Rule, providing that the “prevailing party” gets the attorney’s \nfees. In other words, if you bring suit and the other side wins, your  \nclient may have to pay all attorney’s fees.\n ✓ Parties may contract around the American rule.  The parties may \nuse their freedom of contract to contract around the default rule and \ninclude a provision that the loser must pay the winner’s attorney’s fees. \nSometimes in a contract of adhesion,  the more powerful party drafts the \nattorney’s fee provision so it’s a one-way street: If he wins, you pay, but \nif you win, he doesn’t have to pay. By statute or case law, many states \nhave decided that such a provision must be read as reciprocal. That  \nis, if the contract says that only one party is entitled to attorney’s fees, \nthe court will read it as if it said that the prevailing party is entitled  \nto the fees.\nJustifying breach: The economist’s  \nnotion of the efficient breach\nContract cases usually lend themselves to settlement rather than litigation \nbecause, in general, nothing terrible happens to the breaching party. In the \ntypical scenario, the breaching party is usually no worse off by breaching \nthan if she performed.\n For example, suppose a contractor bids $10,000 to do a job and then discov -\ners that the actual cost of doing the work is $12,000. If she completes the job, \nshe’ll be out $2,000. If she breaches the contract, another contractor may do \nthe job for $12,000, meaning that the breaching party will be liable for only \n$2,000 in damages for breach of contract. In fact, the breach is likely to be  \nless costly than performance because the first contractor knows that the \nother party faces transaction costs in bringing a claim and will probably  \nsettle for less than $2,000 to avoid those costs.\nIn many cases, breach may actually produce better economic results than \nperformance! Economists describe this scenario as the theory of efficient \nbreach.  An efficient,  or Pareto-optimal, breach is one that leaves at least one \nparty better off and no party worse off than they were before the breach. \nThis situation arises when a party breaches to take advantage of a better \nopportunity and uses some of the gains to pay damages to the non-  \nbreaching party.\n255  Chapter 16: Examining How Courts Handle Breach of Contract\n Suppose, for instance, that an employee has agreed to work for an employer \nfor $100,000. She’s offered another job that pays $120,000, but she must break \nher contract to take it. She can figure that her initial employer will incur some \nout-of-pocket costs to find a replacement and that it may have to pay the \nreplacement a bit more than her salary. Say these damages for breach come to \n$12,000. When she pays the employer these damages, the employer is no \nworse off; after recovering the damages, the employer has its expectancy — \nan employee for the year at a cost of $100,000. And the employee is better off \nwith the new job, earning $108,000 ($120,000 – $12,000) rather than the \n$100,000 if she had stayed at the first job.\nYou may wonder why so many people perform their contracts if breach carries \nno penalty. The simple answer is this: Even though breach may not hurt them \nfinancially, they see breaching as a moral issue, not an economic one. In other \nwords, they don’t want to be dirty contract-breakers. In fact, contract-breaking \ncan adversely affect an individual’s or business’s reputation. You wouldn’t \nwant to hire a contractor who’s known to be unreliable. In the business world, \nhowever, customary business norms often trump both moral and legal norms. \nContracts expert Stewart Macaulay discovered that people in the business \nworld often follow their way of doing things rather than the dictates of contract \nlaw, even though it may drive their lawyers crazy. (You can read more about \nMacaulay and his contributions to contract law in Chapter 22.)\nThe case against punitive damages\nEconomists make a pretty good case against \nawarding punitive damages for breach, argu -\ning that the fear of punitive damages would be \nbad for business and, therefore, the economy. \nFor example, if an auto manufacturer ordered \nsteel and then realized it didn’t need it because \nof a decline in business, the threat of punitive \ndamages may discourage the manufacturer \nfrom canceling the order, paying damages, and \nletting the steel go to where it could be used \nmost efficiently.\nThe goal of punitive damages is to deter certain \nbehavior, and contract-breaking is not necessarily  behavior that should be deterred. Breaking a \ncontract may be in a party’s best economic inter -\nests, and contract law in theory provides that the \nbreaching party compensates the other party for \nthe breach. Of course, in practice, the breach -\ning party rarely offers to pay all the damages, \nand the transaction costs involved in recovering \ndamages typically leave the non-breaching party \nworse off after a breach. Still, a system based on \nallocation of resources through contract is more \neffective than alternatives such as systems that \nenforce all contracts or that allocate resources \nthrough central planning.",17191
84-Recognizing How Contract Law Limits the Damages for Breach.pdf,84-Recognizing How Contract Law Limits the Damages for Breach,"256 Part V: Exploring Remedies for Breach of Contract \nRecognizing How Contract Law  \nLimits the Damages for Breach\n The plaintiff in a breach of contract case faces an uphill battle. Any damages \nthe court awards are limited by the following considerations:\n ✓ Causation:  The plaintiff must prove that the breach caused the loss.\n ✓ Certainty:  The plaintiff must prove the damages to a reasonable certainty.\n ✓ Foreseeability:  The plaintiff can recover only the losses that the defen -\ndant would reasonably have known, at the time the parties made the \ncontract, would likely result from the breach.\n ✓ Mitigation: The plaintiff must make reasonable efforts to minimize the \ncost of the breach.\nI discuss all these points in this section.\nConcluding whether the  \nbreach caused the loss\nThe rule of causation  requires a plaintiff to prove that breach caused the loss. \nProving that the loss resulted from the breach is usually obvious and generally \nnot an issue. Sometimes, however, causation gets tangled up with consequen -\ntial damages and mitigation and can become an issue when the breach has \nmultiple causes. (See the later sections “Limiting damages with the rule of fore -\nseeability” and “Asking whether the non-breaching party mitigated the loss.”)\nFor example, in the case of Freund v. Washington Square Press,  the plaintiff \nwas Freund, a college professor and author who sued his publisher because \nthe publisher failed to publish his book as promised. In addition to suing for \nthe expectancy, Freund also claimed that because his book wasn’t published, \nhe didn’t get a promotion. But the court found that in spite of the breach and \nhis failure to publish, he had been promoted without delay. Therefore, the \nbreach didn’t cause that loss.\nIn other cases, certain losses may be traced back to a plaintiff’s failure to mit -\nigate rather than to the breach itself. In a Montana case, a rancher claimed \nthat defective bull semen caused the loss of his cattle crop. He then got car -\nried away and claimed that the loss of that crop prevented him from getting \n257  Chapter 16: Examining How Courts Handle Breach of Contract\nanother crop, and that crop would have had another crop, and so he lost an \ninfinite number of cattle! The court pointed out that all the rancher had to do \nwas get the cattle reinseminated to prevent any further loss.\nTo handle the problem of multiple causes, a court may determine whether \nthe defendant’s breach was a substantial contributing cause of the loss, even \nif it wasn’t the only cause. For example, assume that a manufacturer was \nmaking boots for the army and lost the contract because several of its part \nsuppliers breached their contracts. If the manufacturer sued only one of the \nsuppliers, the supplier would claim that even if it had delivered its parts, the \nmanufacturer still wouldn’t have been able to deliver the boots to the army, \nbecause other suppliers failed in their contracts. Thus, it didn’t cause the \nloss. The other suppliers could make the same claim, leaving the manufac -\nturer with no damages from anyone. To handle this problem, the court would \nlikely hold responsible any of the suppliers whose breach was a substantial \ncontributing cause of the loss.\nDetermining whether the loss  \nis established with certainty\nIn a case of breach of contract, the plaintiff must prove damages to a reasonable \ncertainty. In other words, contract law doesn’t award speculative damages.\n In Freund v. Washington Square Press  (introduced earlier in the section \n“Concluding whether the breach caused the loss”), the trial court awarded \nFreund $10,000, which an expert testified was the cost of getting the book pub -\nlished. But the appellate court found that an author’s expectancy isn’t the cost \nof getting the book published — that’s the publisher’s cost of performance. \nInstead, the author’s expectancy is the royalties he would’ve had from sales of \nthe book. But Freund was unable to prove to a reasonable certainty how many \ncopies of a book that was never published would’ve sold. Because he could \nprove he was damaged but couldn’t prove the amount of the damage, the \ncourt awarded him nominal damages of six cents!\n The certainty problem can be difficult to overcome. An existing business, for \nexample, can project losses based on its earnings over a similar period, but a \nnew business can’t. The rule, however, doesn’t require absolute certainty — it \nrequires only reasonable  certainty. If Freund had published other books, or if \na new business can show what comparable businesses would’ve earned, the \nevidence may have satisfied the requirement. So be sure that you can provide \nsome hard evidence of losses.\n258 Part V: Exploring Remedies for Breach of Contract \nLimiting damages with the  \nrule of foreseeability\nDamages come in two types: direct and consequential. Direct damages are \nlosses that result from the promisee’s not getting what was promised. Those \nlosses always result from breach. Consequential damages are losses set in \nmotion by the loss of what was promised, which could significantly exceed \ndirect damages if they weren’t limited. For example, a factory may order a $5 \npart. If the seller of the part breaches by not delivering it, the factory has to \nbuy a replacement part, which may cost only a few dollars more. But while \nwaiting for the part, it may have to close its assembly line, causing hundreds \nof thousands of dollars in damages, all for the want of a $5 part. Those are \nthe consequential damages.\nIn 1854, an English court decided whether the party who contracted to sell \nthat part would be liable for those resulting damages, and the rule is still \naround today, as I explain next. This section explains the rule of foresee-  \nability,  which determines whether a breaching party like the $5-part seller  \nis liable for consequential damages, and it provides guidance on how to  \ndraft a provision that excludes or limits such damages.\nWorking with Hadley v. Baxendale: The rule of foreseeability\n The 1854 English case of Hadley v. Baxendale  continues to set the stan -\ndard for determining whether a party can recover consequential damages. \nHadley operated a steam-powered mill — a technological wonder of the \nearly Industrial Age. A steam engine generated the power to turn a crank -\nshaft, which turned a wheel that ground the grain. A crankshaft at Hadley’s \nmill broke, so he arranged to have it taken to the manufacturer for repair or \nreplacement. The carrier, Baxendale, agreed that if Hadley got the crankshaft \nto him by noon, the carrier would deliver it to the manufacturer the next day. \nThe carrier breached its promise, and Hadley was without a crankshaft for \na longer period than if Baxendale had performed as promised. Hadley sued \nBaxendale for the profit he would’ve made from the mill’s operation if the \ncrankshaft had been available at the time promised. The jury, apparently  \nwithout any rule to guide them, found for Hadley. Baxendale appealed.\nOn appeal, the court described the two kinds of damages: direct damages, \nwhich always arise from the breach, and consequential damages, which the \nbreaching party, when entering the contract, would know would likely result \nfrom the breach. But how would the breaching party know about the likely \ndamages that might result from breach? Either because he had actual knowl -\nedge (the other party told him) or he had imputed knowledge (a reasonable \nperson would have known it).\n259  Chapter 16: Examining How Courts Handle Breach of Contract\nIn the case of Hadley and Baxendale, the direct damages were the loss of \nthe crankshaft for a time; the damages for that loss would probably be the \nrental cost of a crankshaft. The consequential damages were the lost prof -\nits that were set in motion by the delay. The court held that Hadley wasn’t \nentitled to the consequential damages because a reasonable carrier wouldn’t \nhave known that Hadley was unable to operate the mill without a crankshaft \n(Hadley may have had a spare crankshaft lying around, or maybe other parts \nof the mill didn’t work as well and Hadley didn’t tell them otherwise).\n The rule of Hadley v. Baxendale  has become known as the rule of foreseeabil -\nity, which states that the breaching party is liable only for the losses that a \nreasonable party in the shoes of the breaching party would have known, at  \nthe time of the contract, would likely result from the breach.\nThis rule is practical because it allows the parties to negotiate which dam -\nages the breaching party will be liable for. Assume that Hadley has learned \nhis lesson. The next time he takes a broken crankshaft to a carrier, he tells the \ncarrier, “My good man. This is my only crankshaft, and if you are late deliver -\ning it, I will hold you liable for all the losses that result from the late delivery.” \nThe carrier, now knowing of his potential liability, uses his freedom of contract \nto shift the risk back to Hadley. “Sorry, my good man,” he says, “but I won’t \naccept the shipment on that basis. I will accept it only if you sign this contract \nthat clearly states, ‘Shipper is not liable for consequential damages.’”\nProtecting your client with a consequential damages provision\nAccording to the rule of foreseeability (discussed in the preceding section), \nyou’re not liable if you don’t know or have no reason to know about the con -\nsequential damages that may result from breach. However, if your client does \nknow or has reason to know about potential consequential damages, con -\nsider drafting a disclaimer to contract around such damages. Provisions that \ndisclaim consequential damages or limit them to a certain amount frequently \narise in the terms of service and in warranties, as I discuss in Chapter 10.\nShipping services, for instance, state that they’re liable only for the cost of \nshipping and not for any consequential damages. If customers want to cover \nthose losses, they’re free to purchase insurance.\n A tire seller, for example, knows that if it sells a defective tire, it’s responsible for \nthe direct damages that result from the defect — the cost of repairing or replac -\ning the tire. Without being told, the seller also knows that the defective tire may \ncause other damage, such as property damage or personal injury. So under the \nrule of foreseeability, the tire seller would be liable for those consequential dam -\nages. To protect itself against those losses, most tire sellers include a provision \nclearly stating that they’re not liable for consequential damages.\n260 Part V: Exploring Remedies for Breach of Contract \nAlthough provisions excluding or limiting consequential damages are gener -\nally legal, one exception limits the seller’s right to protect itself in that way. \nAccording to UCC § 2-719(3), the limitation of consequential damages for  \npersonal injury in the case of consumer goods is prima facie  (on its face) \nunconscionable. In other words, the tire seller could disclaim liability for  \nconsequential damages for personal injury if it sold the tire to a truck  \ndriver but not if it sold the tire to a commuter.\nAsking whether the non-breaching  \nparty mitigated the loss\nContract law doesn’t like to give one party something at the expense of \nanother party, so it expects plaintiffs to take reasonable steps to reduce the \namount of the loss. According to the rule of mitigation,  also known as the rule Civil procedure: Pleading special damages\nWhen preparing a pleading (a summons and \ncomplaint), be careful about how you state \nyour claim for damages. You have to alert the \ndefendant to your claim for consequential dam -\nages, which are called special damages  in civil \nprocedure. Rule 9(g) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure, adopted by most states, provides \nthe following:\n  (9)(g) Special Damages.\n  If an item of special damage is claimed, it \nmust be specifically stated.\nYour pleading doesn’t need to spell out the \ndirect damages (called general damages  in civil \nprocedure) because those damages always \nresult from breach, so the defendant ought \nto know she may be liable for them. But if the \nplaintiff intends to claim special damages, the \npleadings have to put the defendant on notice of exactly what the plaintiff intends to prove, \nbecause as the rule of foreseeability points out, \nthese damages don’t always occur and may \ncome in different shapes and sizes.\nFor example, in a Montana case, a musician \ntook the seller of some sound equipment to \ncourt because he claimed the equipment didn’t \nwork. Fine, said the seller, we’ll pay to repair \nthe sound equipment. But the musician then \nexplained that he was a professional musi -\ncian and the equipment had failed at a concert, \ncosting him thousands of dollars. The defendant \nsaid, “We didn’t know that from your plead -\nings.” Because these are special damages, \nthe court had to throw out the claim for those \nlosses. When pleading special damages  on \nbehalf of a plaintiff, be sure to spell out those \ndamages in the pleading.\n261  Chapter 16: Examining How Courts Handle Breach of Contract\nof avoidable consequences,  the defendant isn’t liable for any losses that the \nplaintiff reasonably could’ve avoided. To encourage parties to mitigate their \nlosses, parties may recover as damages any reasonable expenses incurred \nfor mitigating the losses.\n If a factory must shut down its assembly line because a supplier didn’t deliver \na $5 part as promised and if the buyer can satisfy the rule of foreseeability \n(see the earlier section “Limiting damages with the rule of foreseeability”), the \nsupplier may be responsible for consequential damages — the amount of \nmoney the factory lost due to the shutdown. But the buyer has a duty to try to \nmitigate the losses, perhaps by finding another part and getting the assembly \nline going again. The buyer may then recover damages that include the cost of \nprocuring that other part. The plaintiff doesn’t have to make heroic efforts, \njust reasonable efforts to reduce the loss.\n A party has a duty to mitigate only if the breach freed the party to use that \ntime to earn money. In other words, if the party could’ve earned the money \nanyway, it has no duty to mitigate. For example, when a builder agrees to \nbuild a house and is told immediately not to build it, the builder isn’t mitigat -\ning when it takes another job during that time. It could’ve built both houses by \nsubcontracting the work, so the breach didn’t necessarily free the builder to \ndo additional work.\nWhen an employer wrongfully terminates an employee, he frees the employee \nto perform other work, so the employee has a duty to mitigate. If a comparable \nposition opens and the employee takes it or the defendant can prove that the \nemployee could’ve taken it but didn’t, the employee can only recover damages \nequal to the total damages minus what he earned or would have earned by \ntaking the new job. If the employee looked for a comparable job with compa -\nrable pay and couldn’t find one or wasn’t hired, the employee would be eligible \nto collect 100 percent of the damages. In addition, the employee could recover \nthe cost of trying to find a job. Because mitigation benefits the employer, \ncontract law awards as damages the cost of reasonable attempts to secure \nemployment, even if those attempts are unsuccessful.\n In the famous case of Parker v. Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp., Shirley \nMacLaine (Parker) was hired as the female lead in a movie called Bloomer Girl . \nThe movie company then breached the contract by deciding not to make the \nmovie. In mitigation of MacLaine’s damages, the company offered her a role \nin another movie called Big Country, Big Man,  to be filmed at the same time for \nthe same compensation. When MacLaine refused to accept this offer, the com -\npany refused to pay her any damages because of her failure to mitigate.",16145
85-Using Reliance and Restitution as Remedies.pdf,85-Using Reliance and Restitution as Remedies,"262 Part V: Exploring Remedies for Breach of Contract \nThe majority of the California Supreme Court found that the case turned on \nwhether the employment offered in mitigation was “different or inferior” from \nthe original employment, because historically an employee doesn’t have to \nlower her status in order to mitigate. The court found that the two roles had \nsubstantial differences, including (1) she had the right to approve the direc -\ntor of one but not the other, (2) one was the lead in a song-and-dance produc -\ntion, and the other was the female lead in a western, and (3) one was filmed \nin Hollywood, and the other was filmed in Australia. A strong dissent pointed \nout that of course another job is always different, but different does not nec -\nessarily mean inferior. Furthermore, whether the distinctions really did make \nthe second job inferior was a fact question that shouldn’t be resolved by an \nappellate court.\nUsing Reliance and Restitution  \nas Remedies\nIn addition to the expectancy damages, courts may use reliance and restitu -\ntion as remedies to obtain financial justice for breach. Here’s a rundown of \neach remedy:\n ✓ Reliance:  Reliance arises when a party reasonably changes her posi -\ntion in response to another party’s promise, as I explain in Chapter 4. \nReliance damages consist of the amount of money required to put  \nthe party back to her original position by compensating her for out-  \nof-pocket expenses.\n ✓ Restitution:  Restitution arises when, after one party confers on another \nparty a benefit that’s not officious (forced on him) and not a gift, contract \nlaw requires that the recipient disgorge  (return the value of) the benefit. \nThe measure of restitution is the value of the benefit he received.\nThis section explains how courts are likely to apply reliance and restitution \nas remedies.\nSeeking reliance damages for breach\nIn a contract case, the non-breaching party generally claims the expectancy \n(as I explain in the earlier section “Mastering the Rule of the Expectancy”). \nParties may also seek reliance damages in addition to or rather than the \nexpectancy damages.\n263  Chapter 16: Examining How Courts Handle Breach of Contract\nTo qualify for reliance damages in addition  to the expectancy, a party must \nprove that she incurred a certain expense due to her reliance on the other \nparty’s performance. For a party to be eligible for reliance damages, the loss \nmust be suffered because of the breach. If the losses would’ve been incurred \nregardless of the breach, they’re not eligible.\n For example, suppose you promise a pizza oven for my business, and I build \na platform for it. You breach by failing to deliver the oven, and I have to buy \na different oven. If the platform works for the new oven, I can’t recover the \ncost of the platform in reliance, because I would’ve had that expense even if \nyou had performed. If I can’t use the platform for the new oven, however, I \nshould be able to recover that expense, because I built the platform relying on \nyour performance, the loss was caused by the breach, and I would not have \nincurred the cost of two platforms. I’m also entitled to the expectancy dam -\nages, which may include direct damages if I paid more for the replacement \noven, and consequential damages if the lack of an oven resulted in a loss of \nrevenue that you should’ve reasonably foreseen.\nA party may also recover reliance damages when the party is unable to prove \nthe expectancy. Think of this as a fallback position, because the expectancy \ndamages are likely to be greater, and a court may limit the reliance damages \nif the party wasn’t eligible for the expectancy damages.\n In a famous case, a boxer canceled a prizefight after the promoter had spent \nmoney promoting it. Theoretically, the promoter was entitled to the expec -\ntancy damages — the profit he would’ve earned had the fighter honored the \ncontract — but those damages were speculative (uncertain). However, the \npromoter was able to fall back on recovering the out-of-pocket expenses he \nhad incurred in reliance on the fight being held, including ticket printing and \nadvertising. However, if the fighter could demonstrate that the fight would \nhave lost money (no expectancy damages), the court would likely not award \nreliance damages.\nGranting restitution for breach\nIf one party confers a benefit on another without intending it as a gift or forc -\ning it on the other party, the party conferring the benefit may have a claim for \nrestitution (see Chapter 4 for details). In addition, when one party performs \nfully or partially before the other party breaches the contract, the party who \nconferred the benefit can then claim restitution from the breaching party.\n The clearest example of restitution is return of a down payment. Assume that I \npromise to sell my house to you for $200,000, and you give me a $10,000 down \n264 Part V: Exploring Remedies for Breach of Contract \npayment. I then breach by refusing to sell the house to you. You may be entitled \nto the expectancy damages if the house was worth more than $200,000. But \nregardless of whether you recover the expectancy damages, I would clearly be \nforced in restitution to disgorge the benefit you conferred on me when you gave \nme the $10,000 down payment.\nA party who can’t establish any expectancy damages, perhaps because it’s \na losing contract or because the amount of the expectancy is speculative, \nsometimes claims restitution instead. By losing contract,  I mean that if both \nparties performed, the non-breaching party would have had a loss rather \nthan a gain.\n Suppose a contractor agrees to build a home for $200,000, thinking that he will \nincur $180,000 in costs and earn a $20,000 profit. After the builder has com -\npleted 90 percent of the house at a cost of $190,000, the owner breaches. \n(Note that the owner  breaches, not the contractor.) Clearly, if the contractor \nhad finished the house, it would’ve cost him more than $200,000 (probably \nmore like $211,000) and he would’ve been paid $200,000. Therefore, the con -\ntractor would’ve had no claim for the expectancy because if both parties had \ncompleted the contract, he would’ve had a loss rather than a gain. Instead, he \ncan seek restitution for the value of the benefit he conferred on the owner.\nCalculating the benefit conferred is one of the more interesting challenges of \ncontract law. In the case of the contractor, the portion of the house he built \nis probably worth a minimum of its cost — but the contractor may claim it’s \nworth $209,000 because if he had put $190,000 into it, he could’ve sold the \nincomplete structure for $209,000 when his 10 percent profit was added. The \nowner would probably claim that $209,000 is absurd, because it’s more than \nthe contract price, but the contractor can say he’s not claiming under the \ncontract, where recovery is measured by the contract price, but in restitution, \nwhere recovery is measured by the reasonable value of the benefit conferred.\nUnfortunately, contract law has no clear solution to this problem. The solu -\ntions range from $180,000 (90 percent of the contract price for a 90 percent \ncompleted house) to $209,000 (what the price would’ve been if the parties had \ncontracted for that unfinished dwelling) to whatever a third-party appraiser \nwould say it was worth.\nDeciding whether dirty contract-breakers should get restitution\nWhen a party performs only partially and then breaches, the courts must \ndetermine whether the dirty contract-breaker is entitled to any recovery. \nRecall that the courts aren’t interested in penalizing either party; the goal is \n265  Chapter 16: Examining How Courts Handle Breach of Contract\nfinancial justice. How a court deals with situations like this depends on many \nfactors, initially including whether the contract-breaker substantially per -\nforms. Here’s what happens in each instance:\n ✓ The contract breaker substantially performs:  A party who substantially \nperforms and then breaches can recover on the contract (see Chapter 14 \nfor details). She would recover whatever was promised her in the contract \nminus the damages due the other party.\n  Assume that a contractor completes 90 percent of the work on a $200,000 \nhouse and then quits, and the owner has the house finished by another \ncontractor at a cost of $30,000. If the court finds that the first contractor \nsubstantially performed, he can recover the contract price of $200,000 \nminus the damages of $30,000, which is $170,000. The owner in this case \nhas the expectancy of a house at a cost of $200,000, which she gets by \npaying the initial contractor $170,000 and the second contractor $30,000.\n  You may be wondering what happens if the cost of completion is lower, \nsay $15,000. Does the contractor still recover the contract price minus \nthe cost of completion ($200,000 – $15,000 = $185,000)? Most courts \nwould limit the contractor’s recovery to the pro rata part of the contract \nthat the contractor completed. If she did 90 percent of the work on a \n$200,000 house, she should get no more than 90 percent of the contract \nprice: $200,000 × 0.90 = $180,000. Notice that this solution lets the non-\nbreaching party, not the contract-breaker, keep the benefit of the lower \ncost of completion.\n ✓ The contract breaker doesn’t substantially perform:  If the court finds \nthat the breaching party didn’t substantially perform, that party can’t \nsue on the contract. As I explain in Chapter 14, the breaching party is \nentitled to nothing under the contract because she didn’t bring about \nthe event that had to occur before she could get paid. So this party must \nfall back on a claim in restitution.\n  Most (but not all) courts allow a breaching party to recover restitution, \nbut the measure of restitution varies widely. Some courts handle scenar -\nios like this as if the breaching party had substantially performed; the \ncourts start with the contract price and subtract the amount required \nto put the non-breaching party where he would’ve been had he received \nwhat he was promised. Other courts start with the value of the benefit \nconferred to the non-breaching party but cap the restitution to give the \nnon-breaching party the expectancy.\n266 Part V: Exploring Remedies for Breach of Contract \nComputing the value of the benefit conferred\nIn the old days, dirty contract-breakers didn’t get \nrestitution, which doesn’t seem fair, because \nunder this rule, the more the party performs \nbefore breach, the more he loses. If a contrac -\ntor knew he wasn’t going to get anything if he \ndidn’t finish, he’d be more inclined to breach \nearly rather than try to complete the project.\nThe modern rule gives restitution to the breach -\ning party, but contract law is still left with the \nproblem of how to measure that restitution. \nSome courts award the contract price minus \nthe cost of completion, which is a bit odd, \nbecause restitution is supposed to be based on \nthe value of the benefit conferred.\nA better approach would be to start by trying \nto measure the value of the benefit conferred, \nwhile keeping in mind that the expectancy of \nthe non-breaching party comes first. Assume \nthat a contractor does 50 percent of the work on \na $200,000 house and then quits, and the owner \nhires a second contractor to finish the house at \na cost of $110,000. If you start with the contract price, restitution based on the value conferred \nis 50 percent of the contract price: $200,000 × \n0.50 = $100,000. Because the owner hired the \nsecond contractor to complete the project for \n$110,000, however, the first contractor can’t \nrecover in restitution more than $90,000.\nIf you start with the value of the benefit con -\nferred on the owner, the contractor is going \nto claim that the value is $110,000, because a \nreasonable contractor would’ve charged that \nmuch for that job. However, the fact that a \nparty racked up a lot of time doing work doesn’t \nmean it’s worth that much. A good tip to use in a \nsituation like this is to measure the value of the \nbenefit conferred from the point of view of the \nnon-breaching party. That is, ask how much the \nwork is worth to the owner. The answer will be \na maximum of $90,000, but it may well be less \nif the work was poor quality. As Arthur Corbin \nsaid in another context, you need the wisdom \nof Solomon to compute the value of the benefit \nconferred in a restitution claim.",12615

87-Comparing Common-Law and UCC Remedies.pdf,87-Comparing Common-Law and UCC Remedies,"Chapter 17\nExploring Remedies in  \nArticle 2 of the UCC\nIn This Chapter\n▶ Comparing UCC to common-law remedies\n▶ Awarding remedies to buyers when sellers breach\n▶ Handing out remedies to sellers when buyers breach\nI \nn transactions that involve the sale of goods, contract law turns to Article \n2 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) for guidance in awarding dam -\nages for breach of contract. The UCC approach differs somewhat from the \ncommon-law approach I describe in Chapter 16, but the desired result is \npretty much the same: to give the non-breaching party what it would’ve had \nif both parties had performed.\nThis chapter compares the UCC and common-law approach to remedies and \nexplains how the courts use the UCC formulas and the principles behind \nthem to calculate remedies for both buyers and sellers.\nComparing Common-Law  \nand UCC Remedies\nThe goal of common-law remedies for breach is to give both parties the \nexpectancy,  or what they would’ve received had both parties performed (see \nChapter 16). UCC remedies have the same goal, but the statutes use a more for -\nmulaic approach, using actual formulas in some cases to calculate remedies.\n268 Part V: Exploring Remedies for Breach of Contract \nBut don’t let the formulas lull you into thinking that the UCC makes calculating \nremedies an exact science. According to UCC § 1-305, the remedies “should \nbe liberally administered.” In other words, the courts are instructed not to be \nrigid in following the formulaic approach but instead to act in the spirit of the \nmore liberal common-law rules. Furthermore, when applying the UCC formu -\nlas, consider some common-law rules, including causation, foreseeability, cer -\ntainty, and mitigation, that may not be expressly stated in the statutes.\nUCC remedies are more similar to their common-law cousins than they are \ndifferent. This section highlights the key difference and similarity between \nthe two.\nRecognizing the key difference\nThe key difference between the common-law and UCC approach to arriving at \nremedies for breach is this: Goods can usually be bought and sold in a market, \nand even if no actual sale occurs, a market price can be determined. In this \nrespect, a contract to buy 100,000 widgets differs from a construction contract \nor an employment contract, because the non-breaching party in contract or \nemployment agreements won’t find a handy market with established prices.\n Many goods are fungible  (interchangeable). As defined in UCC § 1-201(b)(18), fun-\ngible  means that “any unit, by nature of usage or trade, is the equivalent of any \nother like unit.” So if I promise to sell you 100,000 bushels of winter wheat, this \ncommodity could come from any supplier of winter wheat. Furthermore, we can \nreadily find a market price in a place where winter wheat is regularly traded.\nOf course, although a market to buy and sell the goods usually exists, Article 2 of \nthe Code applies to all sales of goods, even when no market for the goods exists. \nWhen no market exists, the buyer may seek specific performance,  which means \na demand that the seller provide the goods (see “Seeking specific performance: \nGetting the promised goods,” later in this chapter).\nUnderstanding just how  \nsimilar they really are\nIf a contract involves the sale of goods, you can look to UCC Article 2 for the \nrules that govern remedies. For the most part, the UCC is another way to \nexpress common-law rules. So if you understand the common-law rules that \ngovern remedies, you already have a good grasp of the UCC rules.",3605
88-Giving the Buyer a Remedy When the Seller Is in Breach.pdf,88-Giving the Buyer a Remedy When the Seller Is in Breach,"269  Chapter 17: Exploring Remedies in Article 2 of the UCC\nAccording to the Code, remedies must be “liberally administered” to serve  \nthe general purposes of remedies. As enacted in North Carolina at 25-1-305(a), \n§ 1-305(a) states the following:\n§ 25-1-305. Remedies to be liberally administered.\n(a) The remedies provided by this Chapter shall be liberally administered \nto the end that the aggrieved party may be put in as good a position as if \nthe other party had fully performed, but neither consequential or special \ndamages nor penal damages may be had except as specifically provided \nin this Chapter or by other rule of law.\nIn other words, courts should keep their eyes on the expectancy, as I explain \nin Chapter 16. Furthermore, because the goal of expectation damages is to \nput the non-breaching party “in as good a position,” as she would’ve been in \nhad the parties performed, courts must be careful not to overcompensate \nor undercompensate that party. The warning against “penal damages,” for \nexample, tells courts not to award punitive damages, which would overcom -\npensate the non-breaching party.\nIn applying remedies in an Article 2 transaction, always remember that not all \nthe applicable rules are expressly stated in the Code. Section 1-103(2) states \nthat unless displaced by a particular provision, the general principles of law \nand equity supplement the Code provisions. Chapter 16 explains a number of \nthese general principles, such as causation, certainty, and mitigation.\nGiving the Buyer a Remedy  \nWhen the Seller Is in Breach\nWhen sellers fail to perform their end of the bargain, buyers are entitled to \nremedies, which include the following:\n ✓ Specific performance:  Demanding the promised goods\n ✓ Cover:  Obtaining the goods from another source\n ✓ Market:  Not obtaining the goods from another source but calculating \ndamages based on the market price\nThis section explains these remedies in greater detail. It also explains when \nto add consequential and incidental damages and what to do when a seller \nbreaches a contract after a buyer accepts goods or services.\n270 Part V: Exploring Remedies for Breach of Contract \nSeeking specific performance:  \nGetting the promised goods\nWith specific performance,  the court orders the defendant to perform the con -\ntract by actually delivering the goods rather than paying money damages for \nbreach. Specific performance is an equitable remedy  as opposed to a remedy \nat law.  Here’s what each of these remedies is:\n ✓ Remedy at law:  Typically money damages\n ✓ Equitable remedy: A court-ordered action, such as requiring a party to \nperform the contract (for more about equitable remedies, see Chapter 18)\nIf you’re seeking an equitable remedy in a court of general jurisdiction, you \nhave to prove that the remedy at law is inadequate. So, with contracts, you \nhave to prove that no matter how much money you get from the defendant, \nyou still won’t get the financial equivalent of performance.\nFor example, outside the UCC are real estate contracts. Courts can enforce \nland sales by specific performance, because money won’t get the buyer the \nequivalent piece of real estate. Similarly, within the UCC, § 2-716(1) says \nthat “specific performance may be decreed where the goods are unique or \nin other proper circumstances.” So if, for instance, you contract to sell me a \nparticular painting by Picasso, money damages won’t get me the equivalent \nof performance because I can’t buy that Picasso painting somewhere else.\nThe reference in the Code to “other proper circumstances” comes up in long-\nterm contracts for the sale of a commodity. For example, if I contract to sell \nyou 100,000 barrels of Saudi Arabian crude oil and breach, you can probably \nfind the oil elsewhere, even if you have to pay a bit more, because it’s fungible. \nTherefore, you couldn’t get specific performance. But if I contract to provide \nyou with 100,000 barrels of Saudi Arabian crude oil each year for the next five \nyears, and then I breach, your expectancy was not just the oil but also a long-\nterm commitment to provide oil. If you’re unable to find a seller willing to pro -\nvide the same long-term contract, specific performance may be appropriate.\nBuying substitute goods and  \ncalculating cover damages\nMost of the time, buyers who don’t get the promised goods from the seller \ncover  after breach by purchasing the same goods somewhere else and then \nseeking damages from the initial seller for the difference between what they \n271  Chapter 17: Exploring Remedies in Article 2 of the UCC\nwould’ve paid under the contract and what they had to pay to cover. The \nCode contains this formula for calculating damages in § 2-712(2):\nHere are the main parts of the equation:\n ✓ Cover price:  The cover price is what the buyer had to pay another sup -\nplier to buy the same goods elsewhere.\n ✓ Contract price:  The c ontract price  is the price named in the contract.\n ✓ Incidental and consequential damages:  Incidental damages are expenses \nrelated to the actual damages, such as storage and shipping costs to \nreturn defective goods. Consequential damages  are losses that result from \nnot receiving what was promised, such as lost sales because a party failed \nto deliver supplies needed in the manufacturing process. (For information \nabout incidental and consequential damages, see “Adding consequential \ndamages for losses caused by the breach” and “Including incidental dam -\nages and subtracting savings,” later in this chapter.)\n ✓ Expenses saved by the breach:  Expenses saved by breach  are any \nsavings that resulted from the breach; for instance, a lower shipping \nexpense from another supplier.\nAs with common law, the principle of mitigation requires the buyer to keep \nthe damages as low as reasonably possible (see Chapter 16 for a rundown on \nthe rules of mitigation). So he has to cover in good faith by purchasing within \na reasonable time at a reasonable price.\n Suppose a buyer in Boston contracted to buy from a seller in Seattle 100,000 \nbushels of winter wheat at $7.50 per bushel. The buyer agreed to pay the ship -\nping cost of $50,000. The seller later breaches. The buyer finds similar wheat \nfrom a seller in Minneapolis for $8.00 per bushel and has to pay shipping costs \nof $30,000 to get it. Here are the numbers:\nCover price:  $800,000\nContract price:  $750,000\nIncidental and consequential damages:  Assume $0 for now\n272 Part V: Exploring Remedies for Breach of Contract \nExpenses saved by the breach:  $20,000 (because according to the con -\ntract, the buyer would have to pay $50,000 in shipping costs but actually \npaid only $30,000, for a savings of $20,000)\nThe formula for calculating damages in this case looks like this:\nEven without the formula, you can see that $30,000 is the correct result under \nthe rule of the expectancy (see Chapter 16 for details on the expectancy). \nHad the seller performed, the buyer would have had the wheat at a cost of \n$800,000, including the shipping cost. Because of the breach, the buyer has \nthe wheat, but he’s out $830,000 instead. To bring the buyer from where he \nis now (out $830,000) to where he would’ve been had both parties performed \nthe contract (out $800,000), the seller must give him $30,000.\nMaking the buyer whole by  \ncalculating market damages\nSometimes the buyer doesn’t want to cover; that is, she doesn’t want to \nreplace the goods she was promised. If the market price of the goods has \nrisen higher than the contract price, which is the usual reason sellers breach, \nthe buyer suffers a loss even if she doesn’t cover. Had the seller performed, \nthe buyer would have goods worth more than she paid for them. Contract \nlaw allows her to recover that benefit of the bargain. The Code contains this \nformula for calculating market damages in UCC § 2-713:\nNote:  This formula is almost exactly the same as the cover formula in UCC \n§ 2-712 except that it uses “market price” rather than “cover price.” When \n273  Chapter 17: Exploring Remedies in Article 2 of the UCC\nbreach occurs at the time of performance, the two formulas produce the \nsame result, because if the buyer had covered, she would’ve done so at the \nmarket price in order to mitigate damages.\n Assume you were going to sell me a car that was worth $11,000 for only \n$10,000. But then you breach. I could cover by purchasing a comparable car, \nbut I elect not to. I’m still damaged, however, because had you sold me the \ncar, my net worth would’ve increased by $1,000. According to the formula for \ncalculating market damages, I can recover the difference between the market \nprice ($11,000) and the contract price ($10,000), which is $1,000.\nConceivably, I could recover that $1,000 from you and then cover by buying \na comparable car. However, doing so would probably make no difference to \nthe outcome. I’d probably still have to pay $11,000 to get the car I wanted \nat the market price, so I’d end up with no more than my expectancy — an \n$11,000 car that cost me $10,000. (I would’ve paid $11,000, minus the $1,000 I \nreceived in damages from you.)\n Section 2-713 says that the formula uses “the market price when the buyer \nlearned of the breach.” This language creates an issue when a seller breaches \nby anticipatory repudiation  (breaching before performance is due, as I explain in \nChapter 15), because the Code says “learned of the breach” and not “learned of \nthe repudiation.” Some courts therefore plug into the formula the market price \nat the time of performance rather than the market price at the time of the repu -\ndiation. The better choice is to use the price at the time of repudiation (or more \nprecisely, a commercially reasonable time after the buyer learned of the repu -\ndiation, because the buyer may need some time to shop around for the best \nprice). Why? Because if the buyer starts shopping for cover goods at that time, \nit reduces the cost of breach, and less money wasted is a good thing.\n Suppose a buyer agrees to purchase 100,000 bushels of winter wheat at $7.50 \nper bushel to be delivered October 1. On August 1, when the market price \nreaches $7.75 per bushel, the seller clearly and unequivocally informs the buyer \nthat he isn’t going to perform. The buyer waits until October 1 when the market \nprice is $8.00 per bushel, and when the seller fails to deliver on that day, the \nbuyer seeks to recover damages. If she plugs into the formula the difference \nbetween the market price of $800,000 at the time of performance, October 1, \nand the contract price of $750,000, then she can claim damages of $50,000.\nHowever, she could’ve mitigated by buying the goods at the time of the repu -\ndiation. Had she done so, the damages would’ve been the difference between \nthe market price at the time of the repudiation on August 1 ($775,000) and \nthe contract price ($750,000), and she could recover only $25,000. This is the \nbetter interpretation of the language because it discourages the buyer from \n274 Part V: Exploring Remedies for Breach of Contract \ndoing nothing at the expense of the seller. Similarly, if a buyer covers but \npays more than the market price, her damages are calculated according to \nthe market formula, giving her what she would’ve had if she had covered in a \nreasonable manner.\nAdding consequential damages  \nfor losses caused by the breach\nAs I explain in the preceding two sections, the formulas for both cover dam -\nages and market damages include the buyer’s right to recover consequential \ndamages. The UCC incorporates the rule of foreseeability (the Hadley rule) \nfor consequential damages (see Chapter 16). The rule is found in UCC § \n2-715(2)(a). As enacted in North Carolina at 25-2-715(2)(a), it provides:\n  (2) Consequential damages resulting from the seller’s breach include\n  (a) any loss resulting from general or particular requirements  \nand needs of which the seller at the time of contracting had reason \nto know and which could not reasonably be prevented by cover  \nor otherwise;\n This section of the Code contains the only express reference to mitigation in \nArticle 2, though you know that the concept should be applied because UCC  \n§ 1-102 tells you to supplement the Code with common-law principles.\n Suppose the wheat buyer in the example in the preceding section operates \na cereal factory and needs the wheat she contracted to buy to make cereal. \nWhen she doesn’t receive the wheat, she says she can’t make the cereal and \nclaims as consequential damages the lost profit from her cereal sales. The \nseller has two defenses to this claim:\n ✓ Lack of advance knowledge:  The seller is liable only for consequential \ndamages that, in the words of UCC § 2-715(2)(a), “the seller at the time \nof contracting had reason to know.” Although this seller would probably \nknow that the wheat was used to produce cereal, he wouldn’t know that \nthe buyer was running low on inventory and would have to stop produc -\ntion if she didn’t get this particular shipment. If the buyer had told the \nseller at the time they made the contract, “If I don’t get that wheat, my \nassembly line will stop, and I won’t be able to make cereal,” that discus -\nsion would’ve addressed the foreseeability issue.\n ✓ Loss prevention:  The seller is liable only for a loss “which could not reason -\nably be prevented by cover or otherwise.” Here, the buyer could’ve pre -\nvented the loss simply by covering — buying the wheat somewhere else. \nRemember:  The principle of mitigation doesn’t allow a buyer to rack up \nlosses at the seller’s expense when she reasonably could prevent them.\n275  Chapter 17: Exploring Remedies in Article 2 of the UCC\nIncluding incidental damages  \nand subtracting savings\nIncidental damages  is a phrase that’s unique to the Code. In the case of a \nbuyer seeking damages, it’s defined in UCC § 2-715(1). As enacted in North \nCarolina at 25-2-715(1), it provides:\n§ 25-2-715. Buyer’s incidental and consequential damages.\n(1) Incidental damages resulting from the seller’s breach include expenses \nreasonably incurred in inspection, receipt, transportation and care and \ncustody of goods rightfully rejected, any commercially reasonable charges, \nexpenses or commissions in connection with effecting cover and any other \nreasonable expense incident to the delay or other breach.\nIncidental damages are really a form of consequential damages, because \nthey’re expenses set in motion by a breach. If a buyer doesn’t get the correct \ngoods from a seller, he may incur expenses in storing those goods or returning \nthem. If the seller didn’t deliver the goods at all, the buyer may incur expenses \nto find another seller. The main point of this provision is to exempt these \nexpenses from the foreseeability requirement (see Chapter 16 for details). \nBecause these are minor expenses incurred in dealing with the consequence \nof the breach, contract law can assume that the seller would know that they \nwould result from a breach.\n Sometimes a buyer claims that hiring a lawyer to pursue the seller is a reason -\nable incidental expense or consequential loss, but courts have rejected this \nargument. Under the American Rule (see Chapter 16), a party isn’t entitled to \nattorney’s fees unless they provide for them in the contract or sue under a \nstatute that provides for them, and the UCC doesn’t.\nThe final part of the damages formula, both for cover damages and market dam -\nages, is to deduct “expenses saved in consequence of the seller’s breach.” The \nprinciple here is that to the extent the breach saved the buyer some money, \nthe damages should be reduced by that amount. For example, a buyer of winter \nwheat was going to pay $50,000 in shipping expenses to the seller under the \ncontract. When the seller breached, the buyer covered and paid only $30,000 in \nshipping expenses to the second seller. The damages the first seller pays should \nbe reduced by the $20,000 that the buyer saved because of the breach.\nKeeping the goods and claiming damages\nA seller may be in breach even if the buyer accepts the goods from the seller. \nFor instance, perhaps a buyer doesn’t discover within a reasonable time after \ndelivery that the goods aren’t as promised and he doesn’t have the right to \n276 Part V: Exploring Remedies for Breach of Contract \nrevoke acceptance under UCC § 2-608. Or the goods were supplied with a \nwarranty, and a buyer doesn’t discover a breach of warranty until later.\nWhen a buyer accepts goods and then finds that the seller is in breach,  \nthe remedy is provided in UCC § 2-714(2). As enacted in North Carolina at \n25-2-714(2), it provides:\n(2) The measure of damages for breach of warranty is the difference \nat the time and place of acceptance between the value of the goods \naccepted and the value they would have had if they had been as war -\nranted, unless special circumstances show proximate damages of a  \ndifferent amount.\nThe formula under this provision looks like this:\n Suppose a seller delivers a computer that’s warranted to have a 500-gigabyte \nhard drive. After acceptance, the buyer finds that the hard drive is only 250 \ngigabytes. The buyer is entitled to the difference in value between what was \npromised and what was accepted. You could measure this amount in different \nways: the difference in the sale price of the computer with the 500-gigabyte \nhard drive and the same computer with a 250-gigabyte hard drive, or the cost \nof giving the buyer what it was promised, which is usually the cost of repair.\nThe seller may claim that its 500-gig computer sells for $1,000, whereas its 250-\ngig computer sells for $950, making the difference in value $50. But the buyer \nmay claim that to have the 250-gigabyte drive replaced with a 500-gigabyte \ndrive would cost $100, so that repair cost represents the difference in value. \nThis question is a difficult one for a court, but the repair cost appears to be \nmore in line with the principle of the expectancy, because it’s the amount \nneeded to put the buyer where he would’ve been had the seller performed.\nThe formula for keeping the goods and then claiming damages may not seem \nfair to the seller in cases where a seller makes rash promises.\n Suppose a seller offers $1,000 for a computer that it promises has features only \ncomputers that cost $5,000 have. After I buy the $1,000 computer, I discover \nthat it doesn’t have all those features — it only has the features of a $2,000 com -\nputer. The formula says I have a claim for damages of $3,000 — the difference \nbetween the value of what I was promised ($5,000) and what I got ($2,000). The \nseller may think that’s unfair, because I didn’t lose any money — in fact, I got \na $2,000 computer for $1,000. Furthermore, the seller only got paid $1,000 but",19017
89-Providing the Seller a Remedy When the Buyers in Breach.pdf,89-Providing the Seller a Remedy When the Buyers in Breach,"277  Chapter 17: Exploring Remedies in Article 2 of the UCC\nhas to pay $3,000 in damages. Nevertheless, the rule of the expectancy says that \nI’m entitled to the benefit of the bargain I made, and had the seller performed, \nI would’ve had an increase in my wealth of $4,000. The formula gives me that \namount, because I spent $1,000 and got something worth $2,000 plus $3,000 in \ndamages, which leaves me where I would’ve been: $4,000 ahead.\nProviding the Seller a Remedy  \nWhen the Buyer’s in Breach\nAfter you understand the buyer’s remedies against the seller (see the ear -\nlier section “Giving the Buyer a Remedy When the Seller Is in Breach”), the \nseller’s claims against the buyer are easy, because they’re mostly the mirror \nimage of those damages with a few extra wrinkles thrown in. These remedies \ninclude the following:\n ✓ Damages for delivered goods:  Obtaining the contract price\n ✓ Resale:  Selling the goods to another buyer\n ✓ Market:  Not reselling the goods but calculating the damages based on \nthe market price\nIn this section, I explain all three of these remedies as well as what to do \nwhen none of them gives a party the benefit of the bargain.\nSeeking the contract price as damages\nIf a seller has delivered goods to a buyer and the buyer breaches the con -\ntract, the seller’s remedy is simple enough: The seller has performed his part \nof the contract, so he’s entitled to the amount of money that gives him what \nhe would’ve had: the contract price.\n Sometimes this remedy may seem unfair to the seller. Suppose, for example, \nthe seller promises to sell 100,000 bushels of wheat at $7.50 a bushel. The \nmarket price of wheat goes up to $8.00 a bushel, but the seller still delivers the \ngoods. The buyer, however, doesn’t pay the seller the agreed upon $750,000. \nEven though the seller has delivered goods worth $800,000, his expectancy \nwas to get $750,000 for them, so that’s all he can recover.\nYou can find this rule in UCC § 2-709(1)(a). As enacted in North Carolina at \n25-2-709(1), the rule provides:\n278 Part V: Exploring Remedies for Breach of Contract \n  § 25-2-709. Action for the price.\n  (1) When the buyer fails to pay the price as it becomes due the seller \nmay recover, together with any incidental damages under the next  \nsection, the price\n  (a) of goods accepted or of conforming goods lost or damaged \nwithin a commercially reasonable time after risk of their loss has \npassed to the buyer; and\n  (b) of goods identified to the contract if the seller is unable after \nreasonable effort to resell them at a reasonable price or the cir -\ncumstances reasonably indicate that such effort will be unavailing.\nSometimes the seller can recover the contract price of the goods even if he \ndoesn’t deliver them to the buyer. That rule is found in UCC § 2-709(1)(b). \nThis situation usually arises with unusual goods that have no market value.\n Suppose a buyer orders a neon sign for $2,000 that says “Eat at Joe’s” and \nrefuses to accept delivery when it’s finished. The seller has to mitigate by \nmaking reasonable efforts to find a buyer for the goods, but finding someone \nto buy an “Eat at Joe’s” neon sign is probably not going to happen. So he can \nrecover the $2,000.\nSelling to someone else and  \ncalculating resale damages\nMost of the time, when a seller finds that a buyer doesn’t want the goods \nhe contracted to buy, she sells them to someone else. This resale remedy is \nsimilar to the buyer’s cover remedy, in which the buyer purchases the goods \nfrom someone else and then recovers from the seller who’s in breach any \nadditional cost above the contract price (see the earlier section “Buying  \nsubstitute goods and calculating cover damages” for details).\nThe resale formula, as found in UCC § 2-706(1) is this:\n One difference between the resale formula and the cover formula in UCC \n§ 2-712 is that the seller’s remedies don’t include consequential damages, \nbecause when the buyer doesn’t perform, the seller doesn’t get money. To \n279  Chapter 17: Exploring Remedies in Article 2 of the UCC\nprove that nonpayment by one particular buyer caused a foreseeable loss to \nthe seller would be difficult, so as a matter of policy, don’t go there.\n Suppose a buyer in Boston contracted to buy from a seller in Seattle 100,000 \nbushels of winter wheat at $7.50 per bushel. The buyer agreed to pay the \nshipping cost of $50,000. The buyer breaches. The seller finds a buyer in \nMinneapolis who will pay $7.00 per bushel, but the seller has to pay shipping \ncosts of $30,000 to get it there. The numbers look like this:\nContract price:  $750,000\nResale price:  $700,000\nIncidental damages:  $30,000\nExpenses saved by the breach:  $0 (The seller saved nothing, because the \nbuyer was going to pay for shipping.)\nPlug the numbers into the formula:\nEven without the formula, you can see that $80,000 is the correct result  \nunder the rule of the expectancy. If the buyer had performed the contract, \nthe seller would’ve been out the wheat and would have $750,000. Because  \nof the breach, the seller has only $700,000 for the wheat and is out $30,000 for \nthe shipping. To bring the seller from where he is now (having $670,000) to \nwhere he would’ve been had the contract been performed (having $750,000), \nthe buyer has to give him $80,000.\nDeciding whether to complete  \nthe manufacture of the goods\nThe resale remedy assumes that the goods are ready for resale at the time \nof the breach, but what if they’re not? Should the seller continue to manufac -\nture the goods even though doing so may result in the buyer’s paying more in \ndamages? The seller has two options:\n ✓ Stop manufacturing the goods.\n ✓ Manufacture the goods and then sell them.\n280 Part V: Exploring Remedies for Breach of Contract \n Contract law expects the seller to choose the option that the seller reasonably \nbelieves will mitigate her loss to the greatest extent, thus minimizing the  \nbuyer’s liability.\n In the famous common law case of Rockingham County v. Luten Bridge Co.,  the \ncounty ordered a bridge to be built. After construction began, the county \nbreached the contract, saying it didn’t want the bridge. The contractor neverthe -\nless finished the job and then sued for the contract price. The court held that the \ncontractor couldn’t recover for the completed bridge because of mitigation.\nAssume that the contract price was $100,000 and that the contractor was \ngoing to spend $90,000 on labor and materials to make a $10,000 profit. As I \nexplain in Chapter 16, at whatever point the county breaches, the contrac -\ntor recovers enough damages to pay its expenses and end up with a $10,000 \nprofit. So the contractor gets no additional benefit by continuing to work —  \nit always comes out ahead $10,000. But the more work the contractor does, \nthe more money the county loses. To prevent those losses to the county, the \ncontractor must stop work when the county breaches.\nHowever, that common-law rule may not apply to the sale of goods, because \nthe seller can ship the goods elsewhere when they’re finished. Assume, for \ninstance, that a buyer contracts with a seller to build a machine for $100,000, \nand the seller expects to earn a $10,000 profit. After the seller invests $30,000 \nin the machine, the buyer breaches. To give the seller the expectancy, the \nbuyer would need to pay the seller $40,000 in damages. But if the seller com -\npletes the machine and sells it for $80,000, the damages would be only $20,000.\nUCC § 2-704(2) allows the seller to complete the manufacture “in the exercise \nof reasonable commercial judgment.” As enacted in North Carolina at § 25-2-\n704(2), it provides:\n(2) Where the goods are unfinished an aggrieved seller may in the exer -\ncise of reasonable commercial judgment for the purposes of avoiding loss \nand of effective realization either complete the manufacture and wholly \nidentify the goods to the contract or cease manufacture and resell for \nscrap or salvage value or proceed in any other reasonable manner.\nAn interesting problem arises if the seller thought it could reduce the dam -\nages by completing manufacture, but by the time it finishes, the machine is \nobsolete and all the seller can get for it is $20,000. The seller would claim a \nloss of $80,000, but the buyer would claim that the seller could’ve stopped \nproduction and had damages of only $40,000. The outcome of a situation like \nthis probably depends on whether the seller’s decision was reasonable at \nthe time it made the decision, not on how it looks in hindsight. Because the \npolicy of mitigation is so important, most courts agree that a party should \nrecover if it took reasonable steps to save the breaching party money —  \neven if those steps backfired.\n281  Chapter 17: Exploring Remedies in Article 2 of the UCC\nMaking the seller whole by calculating \nmarket damages\nJust as a buyer can decide not to cover and instead recover the difference \nbetween the market price and the contract price, so too can the seller decide \nnot to resell and instead recover the difference between the contract price \nand the market price. The formula to determine the amount the seller is eli -\ngible to recover as market damages, found in UCC § 2-708, is as follows:\nThe market price  is the price that the goods can be sold for at the time and \nplace for tender. ( Tender  means offering the performance.) Unless otherwise \nagreed, when a seller is obligated to send goods to a buyer, UCC § 2-504 says \nthat his obligation isn’t to get them to the buyer but to get them to the car -\nrier, such as a delivery service or railroad. In other words, in a shipment con -\ntract, the seller tenders the goods when he delivers them to the carrier.\n For example, a buyer in Boston contracts to buy from a seller in Seattle 100,000 \nbushels of winter wheat at $7.50 per bushel. The buyer agrees to pay the ship -\nping cost of $50,000. The wheat is to be shipped from Seattle on October 1, \narriving in Boston on October 5. Because this is a shipment contract under \nwhich the seller’s obligation is to tender the goods to the shipper in Seattle on \nOctober 1, the time and place for tender are October 1 in Seattle. So to find the \nmarket price, you’d look up the market price in Seattle on that date.\nAssume that market price in Seattle was $7.00 per bushel. The numbers look \nlike this:\nContract price:  $750,000\nResale price:  $700,000\nIncidental damages: $0\nExpenses saved by the breach:  $0 (The seller saved nothing, because the \nbuyer was going to pay for the shipping.)\n282 Part V: Exploring Remedies for Breach of Contract \nPlugging the numbers into the formula, you see that the buyer owes the seller \n$50,000 in market damages:\nSolving the mystery of lost profits\nSometimes remedies formulas don’t give a party the benefit of the bargain. In \nsuch cases, remember that the overall purpose of the rules is to compensate \nthe injured party for its loss. The Code states in UCC § 1-305 that because \ncompensating the injured party is more important than the literal rules, the \nCode remedies should be “liberally administered” to fairly compensate the \ninjured party.\n A good example of how the Code liberally administers remedies is the lost \nprofits rule  of UCC § 2-708(2). This rule provides that if the other measures of \ndamage wouldn’t give the seller its expectancy, the measure of damages is the \nprofit that the seller would’ve made. This rule applies only to volume sellers, \nor those able to sell a number of the goods.\n For example, assume that I have a contract to sell you my car for $10,000. You \nbreach, and immediately a third party buys the car for $10,000. Under the \nseller’s resale rule of UCC § 2-706, I received my expectancy. The difference \nbetween the contact price and the resale price is $0, so I lost nothing.\nThe same scenario with a new-car dealer has an entirely different outcome, \nhowever. Assume a new-car dealer contracts to sell you a new car for \n$25,000. You immediately say you don’t want it, and a few minutes later, a \nthird party walks into the showroom and buys the car for $25,000. You claim \nthat under UCC § 2-706, the car dealer hasn’t suffered any loss because it \nwas able to resell the car. But the dealer may claim that because it can get a \nsupply of cars from the manufacturer, it could’ve sold cars to both you and \nthe third party, so it’s entitled to the profit it lost on your sale. According \nto the Code, this argument is a good one, but it’s not easy to figure out how \nmuch that lost profit is — leave that task to the accountants.\n283  Chapter 17: Exploring Remedies in Article 2 of the UCC\n In Neri v. Retail Marine,  Mr. Neri bought a boat from Retail Marine for $12,587. \nThe boat had to be ordered from the manufacturer, but before it arrived, Neri \nbreached and said he didn’t want it. The shop spent $674 storing the boat, \ninsuring it, and paying finance charges on it. After four months, Retail Marine \nsold the boat for $12,587. Retail Marine claimed as damages from Neri the \n$2,579 profit it would’ve made, the $674 costs it incurred after the breach,  \nand $1,250 in attorney’s fees.\nThe trial court didn’t award any damages to Retail Marine. The appellate \ncourt, however, realized that this case was a classic example of when a \nseller should recover damages even if it resold the goods. The court quoted \nan authority that stated, “If the dealer has an inexhaustible supply . . . , the \nresale to replace the breaching buyer costs the dealer a sale because, had \nthe breaching buyer performed, the dealer would have made two sales rather \nthan one. The buyer’s breach, in such a case, depletes the dealer’s sales to \nthe extent of one, and the measure of damages should be the dealer’s profit \non the sale.” The court awarded the lost profit of $2,579. The court also deter -\nmined that the $674 was exactly the kind of incidental damages that a seller \ncan recover under UCC § 2-710. However, the court didn’t allow the shop to \nrecover attorney’s fees, because no provision in the Code provides for them \nand the contract didn’t provide for them, either.\n284 Part V: Exploring Remedies for Breach of Contract",14355

(You can read about breach in \nChapter 16. Chapter 17 gives you the lowdown on the most common rem -\nedies used to address breach of contract.)\nThis chapter discusses alternative remedies for breach, explores the sorts \nof transaction costs courts are likely to award in addition to damages, and \nexplains why the courts rarely award attorney’s fees or punitive damages in \ncontracts cases.\nDeciding Whether Equitable  \nRemedies Should Be Granted\nMerry Old England, where most American law came from, had two court sys -\ntems: courts of law and courts of equity. Each had different authority, which \nthey jealously guarded. As you may imagine, the courts of law  had authority \nto grant remedies at law, mainly money damages. The courts of equity  had \nauthority to grant equitable relief, which mainly means ordering somebody \n286 Part V: Exploring Remedies for Breach of Contract \nto do or not to do something. If you went to a court of equity, the judge \nwould look down his nose and ask, “Why isn’t the court of law good enough \nfor you?” You’d then have to explain why the remedy at law was inadequate.\nSuppose back then that your neighbor was building a dam, which, when fin -\nished, would cause water to back up and flood your property. You could wait \nuntil the property was destroyed and sue him at law for money damages. Or \nyou could explain to the court of equity that a better solution would be to  \nget an injunction to prevent your neighbor from building the dam in the  \nfirst place.\nIn most jurisdictions today, the courts of law and equity have been combined \ninto what’s known as the courts of general jurisdiction.  Exceptions exist, nota -\nbly in Delaware, which still has separate courts of equity. If you see a case \non appeal where a chancellor rather than a judge made the decision, you’re \nprobably looking at a court of equity case. Also, many courts of limited juris -\ndiction, such as small claims courts, lack equity powers and can award only \nmoney judgments.\n Even though the court systems have merged, the rule remains: To get equi -\ntable relief, you have to prove that the remedy at law is inadequate. In other \nwords, it’s not just about the money.\nCourts today award two principal forms of equitable relief:\n ✓ Specific performance:  Ordering a party to do something — usually what \nthe party promised to do in the contract\n ✓ Injunction:  Ordering a party not to do something\nThe following subsections describe these forms of equitable relief in detail.\nAwarding specific performance . . . or not\nCourts typically award specific performance when money damages are insuf -\nficient to settle a dispute. The clearest situation in which a court is likely to \naward specific performance involves real estate contracts. Because every \nparcel of real property is unique, money can’t buy a true substitute, so the \ncourt orders specific performance, which the courts can easily enforce —  \nif the seller refuses to convey the property to the buyer, the court can  \ndo it for her.\n In the rest of the world, specific performance is a common remedy. However, \ncourts in the U.S. are reluctant to award specific performance of a contract for \nthe following two reasons:\n287  Chapter 18: Checking for Additional Remedies\n ✓ Specific performance could send debtors to prison.  When a court \ngrants a judgment after a trial, such as finding that a defendant breached \nthe contract and the plaintiff is entitled to $10,000 in damages, it doesn’t \norder the defendant to pay the $10,000. If the judge ordered the defen -\ndant to pay the money and she doesn’t pay up, the defendant would be \nin contempt of court for violating a court order and could be thrown \nin jail. This order would amount to imprisoning debtors, and debtors’ \nprison is an institution that was abolished long ago. Instead, the court \ngives the plaintiff a piece of paper called a judgment that says he’s enti -\ntled to recover $10,000 from the defendant. With a judgment in hand,  \nthe plaintiff can use the resources of the state, such as the sheriff, to \nhelp collect the money.\n ✓ Courts don’t want to order specific performance when they would \nhave to supervise the performance.  If a builder doesn’t finish a con -\nstruction project and the court orders her to complete it, the owner \nwould probably return to court whining that the builder wasn’t doing  \na very good job. The court doesn’t want to get involved in supervising \nthe dispute. Letting the owner find another builder to finish the job is \nmuch easier for the court, so the court awards money damages.\nStopping a party with an injunction\nThe equitable remedy of an injunction  is nearly the opposite of specific per -\nformance. Instead of ordering a person to do something, an injunction orders \nher not to do something. As a practical matter, an injunction often induces \nthe parties to work out their dispute.\n Suppose New York City’s Metropolitan Opera (the Met) hires a star to sing on \na particular night. The star gets a better offer from La Scala in Milan, Italy, and \nsays, “Ha-ha! I’m going to sing at La Scala, instead.” To get the remedy at law, \nthe Met would need to hire a different singer and claim as damages the differ -\nence between what it was going to pay the original singer and what it had to \npay the substitute. But the Met claims that this remedy is inadequate because \nthe singer is unique. This argument is probably a good one. After all, fewer \npeople may be interested in seeing the other singer.\nThe court doesn’t want to order the singer to perform because of problems \nwith supervision (imagine the Met complaining to the judge, “She’s not sing -\ning well enough. Order her to sing better!”) and because doing so may amount \nto involuntary servitude. Instead, the court issues an injunction ordering the \nsinger not to sing on that night for anyone else. This injunction may be enough \nto convince the singer to resolve her differences with the Met.",6685
92-Undoing or Revising the Contract.pdf,92-Undoing or Revising the Contract,"288 Part V: Exploring Remedies for Breach of Contract \nUndoing or Revising the Contract\nCourts may employ the remedy of rescission  to undo a contract or reforma -\ntion to revise the contract. This section explains these two options in detail.\nUnwinding the contract through rescission\nOne alternative contract remedy is to tear up the contract and pretend \nit never happened. Contract law refers to this remedy as rescission.  I like \nto think of it as unwinding the contract, because when the contract is \nrescinded, the parties are supposed to be returned to their pre-contract  \npositions. Rescission can come about in a number of ways:Philadelphia Ball Club v. Lajoie\nAt the turn of the 20th century, the U.S. had \nonly one predominant professional baseball \nleague, the National League. In 1901, some \nentrepreneurs formed a rival league called the \nAmerican League. As often happens in profes -\nsional sports today, you can imagine that the \nnew league tried to recruit a lot of its players \nfrom the existing league. The only problem \nwas that those players had contracts with the \nNational League teams, and the teams didn’t \nwant to let the players go.\nOne such player was Nap Lajoie, a second base -\nman with the Philadelphia Phillies. He was lured to \nbreak his contract and sign with the Philadelphia \nAthletics of the American League. The Phillies \nsued for equitable relief, and the court had to \nresolve the difficult question of whether Lajoie \nwas a unique player. If he was just a run-of-the-\nmill player, the court reasoned that the remedy at \nlaw was adequate — the Phillies could just sign \nanother second baseman and collect the money \ndamages. But if he was unique, equitable relief \nwas appropriate. After examining his statistics, \nthe court concluded that “He may not be the sun in the baseball firmament, but he is certainly a \nbright particular star.” This conclusion was later \nproved prophetic when Lajoie was inducted into \nthe Hall of Fame.\nThe court didn’t grant an order of specific per -\nformance, which would order Lajoie to play for \nthe Phillies. It granted an injunction instead, \nordering him not to play baseball for any other \nteam. The action was brought in state court, \nhowever, so the injunction was valid only in \nPennsylvania, meaning Lajoie wouldn’t be able \nto play any home games for his new team, the \nAthletics. Rather than play him only on the road \n(outside the court’s jurisdiction), the Athletics \ntraded him to Cleveland. He avoided setting foot \nin Pennsylvania until the dispute was resolved \nwhen the two leagues worked out an agree -\nment in 1903.\nToday, the issue of whether a baseball player \nis unique isn’t subject to serious dispute. Most \npeople agree that athletes and star entertainers \nare unique for the purpose of granting equitable \nrelief when they breach their contracts.\n289  Chapter 18: Checking for Additional Remedies\n ✓ Agreement of the parties:  The parties are free to mutually agree to ter -\nminate their contract, as I explain in Chapter 12. The parties can then \ndecide whether to allocate payments. Even if they opt for no allocation \nof payment, consideration for the agreement to rescind still exists, \nbecause each party has gotten something: a release from their contrac -\ntual obligations.\n ✓ A successful defense to contract formation:  After forming a contract, \none of the parties may successfully claim a defense to contract forma -\ntion that vitiates,  or undermines, the contract (see Chapters 6 and 7). \nThese defenses include illegality, lack of consideration, lack of capacity, \nfraud, mistake, and the like. When the contract is avoided because of a \ndefense after one party already conferred a disproportionate benefit on \nthe other party, the courts can ensure a fair outcome by using the prin -\nciples of restitution to compensate the party who conferred the dispro -\nportionate benefit.\n  If I sell my house to you and you prove that we entered into the transac -\ntion because of a mutual mistake, contract law rescinds the contract and \ndischarges our duties. You return title of the house to me, and I return \nthe payments you made. However, because you got the benefit of living \nin the house, the court may require you to make restitution to me for \nyour use of the house before the rescission.\n ✓ A material breach:  If we have a contract and you commit a material \nbreach, I have the option of declaring that my performance under the \ncontract is discharged (check out Chapter 14). In addition, I can recover \ndamages for the breach. Whether you can recover restitution for any \nperformance you rendered prior to the breach was at one time hotly \ndebated. Now the position of the Restatement, as found in § 374, is that \nthe breaching party is entitled to restitution.\n In the 1834 case of Britton v. Turner,  Turner employed Britton to work for one \nyear for $120. Britton breached the contract after nine and a half months. \nBecause this was material breach of an entire contract, Turner was entitled to \nconsider the contract at an end and claim damages.\nThe issue was whether Britton had a claim for the work he had done prior to \nthe breach. The court must have concluded that he couldn’t claim damages \nfor breach of contract because he didn’t substantially perform. His claim was \nin restitution for the value of the benefit he had conferred on Turner. Still, at \nthat time, he was mostly out of luck because he didn’t have clean hands in \nthe matter — he was the party at fault, and the rule at the time was that the \ndirty contract-breaker wasn’t entitled to restitution.\nBut the court changed the rule. It reasoned that if a person in Britton’s situ -\nation didn’t recover anything, he had no incentive to continue performing. \nAfter all, the more he puts in before breach, the more he’d lose. Furthermore, \nan employer may have an incentive to make things difficult for an employee",6004
93-Letting the Parties Determine the Remedies for Breach.pdf,93-Letting the Parties Determine the Remedies for Breach,"290 Part V: Exploring Remedies for Breach of Contract \nand get him to quit before he finishes performing. So the court decided that \neven a dirty contract-breaker should get restitution.\nCalculating the amount of the restitution is a difficult question. Clearly \nTurner’s expectancy has to come first (see Chapter 16 for details on the \nexpectancy). If Turner had to pay someone $30 to finish the job, Britton \nshould get no more than $90, because Turner’s expectancy was to get the \njob done for $120. But if Turner got the contract completed for $20, Britton \nshould get no more than the pro-rata portion of the contract he performed. \nThat is, if the entire job was worth $120 and he completed 9.5/12 of it, he \nshould get no more than (9.5 ÷ 12) × $120 = $95.\n Today this problem doesn’t come up in employment contracts, because wage \nand hour laws protect employees by requiring that employers pay them for \nwork done. However, it can still arise in other transactions, such as construc -\ntion contracts. Most courts follow the rule of this case and grant restitution to \nthe contract-breaker.\nRewriting the contract  \nthrough reformation\nCourts primarily use reformation  (rewriting the contract) for correcting \nscrivener’s errors,  or mistakes made as an agreement is being written down. \nCourts rarely use reformation as a remedy, and when they do, it’s usually to \nconform the written contract to the parties’ understanding when they made \na mistake in transcribing it. If the parties agreed to certain terms and the \nperson who wrote up the agreement accidentally omitted a term, the writing \nis reformed to reflect the agreement that the parties made.\nA controversial use of reformation arises when an unanticipated price \nincrease of an input  (something required to produce what’s being sold) \nburdens the seller of the product or service, who then claims he is excused \nfrom performing the contract. (See Chapter 13 for more on excuse because of \nunanticipated events.) A few courts have taken it upon themselves to rewrite \nthe contract in those instances to make it fairer, but most courts say that \ncontracts are for the parties to make, not for the judges to make for them.\nLetting the Parties Determine  \nthe Remedies for Breach\nContract law supplies rules (referred to as default rules ), but the parties often \nhave the freedom to contract around those rules. (See Chapter 10 for more \n291  Chapter 18: Checking for Additional Remedies\nabout default rules. Chapters 16 and 17 cover the default rules that apply to dam -\nages.) Parties often attempt to contract around the rules by doing the following:\n ✓ Providing for liquidated damages,  or damages determined in advance  \nof breach\n ✓ Providing for limitations on the remedies that would otherwise  \nbe available\nI discuss both of these ways of contracting around the default rules in  \nthis section.\nCalculating liquidated damages\nTo avoid the complexity of calculating damages later, parties sometimes \nagree in advance to liquidated damages  — what the damages will be in the \ncase of breach. In fact, most economists favor the parties’ right to determine \ndamages in advance. However, the courts have a strong policy against puni-\ntive damages  (money awarded to punish the offender rather than to com -\npensate the innocent party) for breach of contract, so most courts allow a \nliquidated damages provision only if the situation passes the first two or all \nthree of the following tests:\n ✓ Damages must be difficult to foresee and calculate.  If a contract is for \nthe sale of goods, calculating actual damages is fairly easy, as I explain \nin Chapter 17. In a construction contract, however, foreseeable losses, \nsuch as those resulting from delay, may be difficult to determine. \nSubcontractors may not be available at the altered times. And tenants \nmay not be able to move in on time and may have claims against the \nowner. And the owner may need additional financing to weather the \nperiod before rents come in. In such a situation, liquidated damages \nwould be appropriate.\n ✓ The parties must make reasonable efforts to calculate the actual dam -\nages.  Given the first test, this calculation may seem impossible, but the \ngoal is to have damages that aren’t punitive. Come up with a number \nthat’s not arbitrary.\n  To prevent damages from appearing to be punitive, consider calculating \nthem on a per diem basis rather than just ballparking a huge lump sum. \nFor example, on a large construction project, liquidated damages mea -\nsured on a daily basis (say, $25,000 per day) would probably be more rea -\nsonable than a lump sum, such as $500,000, because damages for 1-day’s \ndelay can’t reasonably be the same as damages for a 20-day delay.\n292 Part V: Exploring Remedies for Breach of Contract \n ✓ In some jurisdictions, liquidated damages can’t exceed the actual dam -\nages that occurred after the breach.  This rule is known as the hindsight \nrule,  because it disallows liquidated damages based on what happened \nafter the breach even if the first two rules were followed at the time the \nparties agreed to the contract. Liquidated damages in excess of actual \ndamages appear to be punitive, especially where the actual damages are \nminimal, so a court may disallow liquidated damages and award actual \ndamages instead.\n The courts closely scrutinize liquidated-damages provisions, especially if the \nprovision appears to penalize the breaching party rather than compensate the \nnon-breaching party.\n For example, say you hire me as an employee for a year for $100,000. Our \ncontract says that I owe you $50,000 as liquidated damages if I breach. The \nproblem is that because you could probably hire a substitute employee for \nless than $150,000 if I breach, the provision appears to be in the contract to \nprevent me from breaching rather than to compensate you for my breach.  \nThe courts also scrutinize such provisions when a party has little or no bar -\ngaining power (as in the case of consumers) and the liquidated damages  \nseem unreasonable.\nDown payments or deposits that a buyer makes in advance of a purchase are \ngenerally not considered liquidated damages because the parties didn’t nec -\nessarily agree that the down payment was a reasonable amount for the seller \nto retain in the event of the buyer’s breach. The parties are free to contract \naround this rule by expressly agreeing that the down payment is forfeited \nas liquidated damages. For example, when a buyer agrees to purchase real \nestate, the agreement usually requires that the buyer pay a certain amount \nas a down payment, sometimes called an  escrow deposit.  If the buyer goes \nthrough with the purchase, this amount is credited to the sale price, but if \nthe buyer breaches, the agreement provides that the seller may retain this \namount as liquidated damages.\nAn interesting problem arises when parties include a liquidated-damages \nprovision in their contract but a breach results in no actual damages. The \nquestion that arises is whether a party is eligible to recover the liquidated \ndamages even though it suffered no loss.\n For example, suppose a builder is ten days late and the owner demands the \n$25,000 per day in liquidated damages they agreed to in their contract, even \nthough the owner admits that he suffered no actual damages. Contract law \nhas at least three different thoughts on how to resolve the issue:\n293  Chapter 18: Checking for Additional Remedies\n ✓ The economist’s view:  Each party took a risk that the actual damages \nmay be more or less than the actual damages. For instance, if the owner \nhad actually been damaged in the amount of $500,000, he would still get \nonly $250,000. Therefore, the liquidated damages should be recovered \neven in the absence of actual damages.\n ✓ The hindsight rule:  Many courts apply the hindsight rule — now that \nthey know from hindsight the actual damages, they refuse to enforce a \nliquidated damages clause if the actual damages turn out to be nonexis -\ntent or minimal.\n ✓ The middle road:  Some courts take a middle road, allowing the liqui -\ndated damages unless the difference between the liquidated damages \nand the actual damages is so great as to be unconscionable.\nAs you can see from this discussion, contract law leaves a lot of room to chal -\nlenge a liquidated damages clause. The fact that a device designed to prevent \nlitigation may actually end up causing a lot of litigation is unfortunate.\nCalifornia and Hawaiian Sugar Co. v. Sun Ship, Inc.\nCalifornia and Hawaiian Sugar Co., or C&H \nSugar, grew its sugar cane in Hawaii and \nprocessed it in California. In 1979, C&H Sugar \ndecided it would save a lot of money if, instead \nof paying a number of carriers to transport its \nsugar, it built a giant ship just for this purpose.\nSo in the fall of 1979, C&H Sugar contracted \nwith Sun Ship to build the sugar ship for about \n$25 million, with a delivery date of June 30, 1981. \nThe parties realized that if the ship wasn’t deliv -\nered on time, C&H Sugar would be in a pickle, \nbecause it would then have to find alternate \nshipping and may have to pay premium prices \nto get it at the last minute. Because the dam -\nages would be difficult to estimate, this situa -\ntion warranted a liquidated damages provision, \nthus satisfying the first test for enforcement \nof liquidated damages. The parties agreed to \nliquidated damages of $17,000 for every day delivery was late. Because these were sophis -\nticated parties who were trying to work out a \nreasonable formula for liquidated damages, \nthey passed the second test.\nSun Ship experienced many problems build -\ning the ship and delivered it on March 16, 1982, \nalmost nine months late. C&H Sugar demanded \n$4.4 million in liquidated damages. Fortunately \nfor C&H Sugar, many ships were available at \nthe time, so it suffered only $368,000 in losses \nbecause of the breach. Sun Ship tried to invoke \nthe hindsight rule, claiming that it shouldn’t \nhave to pay liquidated damages that were so \nfar out of proportion to the actual damages. \nBut the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, applying \nPennsylvania law, refused to apply the hind -\nsight rule, determining that because the parties \nhad determined the computation of the dam -\nages, the court wasn’t going to interfere.\n294 Part V: Exploring Remedies for Breach of Contract \nProviding for limited remedies\nParties often add a provision to their contract to limit the remedies for \nbreach. As I explain in Chapter 10, merchant sellers often limit the remedies \nfor breach by disclaiming the implied warranty of merchantability and adding \na limited express warranty of their own, which usually specifies available \nremedies and the amount of consequential damages. Alternatively, they may \ngive the implied warranty of merchantability but limit the remedies available \nfor its breach. This section discusses how to limit available remedies and \nconsequential damages.\nLimiting available remedies\nManufacturers often limit the remedy for breach of warranty to “repair and \nreplace.” For example, instead of giving you money damages for breach of \nwarranty, an automobile manufacturer promises to repair or replace defec -\ntive parts for a certain period of time. This remedy leads to an interesting \nsituation when the repair doesn’t take and the buyer has to keep bringing the \ngoods back for repair after repair.\nThe Code has a solution to this problem in UCC § 2-719(2). As enacted in \nNorth Carolina at 25-2-719(2), it provides:\n(2) Where circumstances cause an exclusive or limited remedy to fail of \nits essential purpose, remedy may be had as provided in this act.\n Most courts find that the remedy “fails of its essential purpose” when the \nbuyer doesn’t get what she reasonably expected — goods that work properly. \nIn the event that a buyer doesn’t get what she expected, a common remedy is \nrevocation of acceptance  under UCC § 2-608, which allows the buyer to return \nthe goods and get her money back. Many states have supplemented this rule \nwith a lemon law  that permits the buyer of a car under warranty to return the \ncar if it’s not fixed after a certain number of attempts at repair or a certain \nnumber of days in the shop.\nLimiting consequential damages\nThe default rule is that a buyer can recover as consequential damages the \nlosses set in motion by a breach (see Chapters 16 and 17 for details). Sellers \nare particularly concerned about the amount of these damages, which can \neasily exceed the cost of their product, so they often limit the damages in  \nthe contract.\nThe rule for the sale of goods is in UCC § 2-719(3). As enacted in North \nCarolina at 25-2-719(3), it provides the following:",12885
94-Awarding Transaction Costs on Top of Damages.pdf,94-Awarding Transaction Costs on Top of Damages,"295  Chapter 18: Checking for Additional Remedies\n(3) Consequential damages may be limited or excluded unless the limitation \nor exclusion is unconscionable. Limitation of consequential damages for \ninjury to the person in the case of consumer goods is prima facie uncon -\nscionable but limitation of damages where the loss is commercial is not.\n As you can see from the Code, parties have freedom of contract to limit con -\nsequential damages, but the seller in a consumer goods transaction can’t limit \nliability for personal injury.\n Suppose a company buys accounting software for $499. After it’s installed, the \nsystem crashes due to a bug in the software. The company spends thousands \nof dollars to reboot its system and work around the system while it’s down. \nWhen the company makes its claim against the software vendor, the vendor \noffers to give it $499, pointing out that the contract says, “Damages for breach, \nincluding consequential damages, are limited to the amount of the purchase \nprice of the product.” These limitations are generally enforceable. Note that \nthis example involves software, which is probably not a “good” under Article 2, \nwhich defines goods as things that are movable. Nevertheless, the warranty \nprovisions of most software contracts are structured like those in contracts \nfor the sale of goods, and courts frequently apply the same rules. Because the \nrule wasn’t written for this transaction, judges say it’s applied by analogy.\nIn a typical warranty provision, the seller limits the remedy for breach and \nexcludes consequential damages. An interesting question arises in such a \ncase when the court finds that the limited remedy fails of its essential pur -\npose and the court therefore strikes it from the contract. Does the court \nstrike the consequential damages exclusion as well? Jurisdictions take three \ndifferent approaches to this problem:\n ✓ They strike both provisions.\n ✓ They strike only the limited remedy, not the consequential damages \nexclusion.\n ✓ They strike both provisions if included in the same paragraph but only \nthe limited remedy if the provisions appear in separate paragraphs.  \n(I call this the arbitrary approach. )\nAwarding Transaction Costs  \non Top of Damages\nThe plaintiff in a contracts case has a tough time coming out ahead or break -\ning even. In theory, the injured party gets what he would’ve had if both parties \n296 Part V: Exploring Remedies for Breach of Contract \nhad performed. However, to recover those damages, he incurs transaction \ncosts,  including attorney’s fees and the cost of litigation. This section explores \nwhether a plaintiff can obtain money from the defendant to pay for some of \nthese transaction costs. I also include a subsection on the rare instances when \ncourts award punitive damages to help plaintiffs recover their costs.\nGetting attorney’s fees\nThe general rule in U.S. law is that each side pays its own attorney’s fees, win \nor lose. This rule, which is called the American Rule,  differs from the English \nRule,  which requires the loser to pay the winner’s attorney’s fees.\n Consider the American Rule when planning whether to bring a contract claim. \nBecause contract damages are fairly predictable, you can tell your client how \nmuch she’s likely to recover and the likely cost to get that recovery. Your \nclient can then make a business decision as to whether pursuing the claim  \nis worth it.\nThe American Rule is a default rule, so parties can contract around it. In fact, \nsometimes these provisions are one-sided. A bank, for example, may put in \nthe contract that the bank gets attorney’s fees from the customer but not \nvice versa. Most jurisdictions consider these one-sided provisions unfair,  \nand by either statute or case law they require that the provisions be read  \nas reciprocal.\n Some statutes provide for attorney’s fees, so a plaintiff may want to bring a \nclaim under such a statute instead of or in addition to making a claim under \nthe common law or the UCC. For example, most consumer protection stat -\nutes provide for attorney’s fees on the theory that by bringing such a claim, \nthe attorney is serving the public good. Read the statute carefully, however, \nbecause some statutes provide that only the plaintiff can recover fees, \nwhereas others provide that either party can recover fees.\nRecovering transaction costs\nYou often see at the end of a case that one party is allowed to recover its \ncosts. Unfortunately, the party isn’t allowed to recover all the expenses he \nincurred in bringing the suit. Civil procedure statutes strictly enumerate \nwhich costs a party may recover, and typically they allow the recovery of \nonly limited expenses, such as filing fees and the cost of depositions. They \ndon’t include the main cost, which is usually attorney’s fees.",4888
95-Finding the Law that Governs the Contract.pdf,95-Finding the Law that Governs the Contract,"297  Chapter 18: Checking for Additional Remedies\nPunitive damages? Fuhgeddaboudit!\nPunitive damages are rarely awarded in contracts cases, because such damages \nwould discourage breach. You may think it strange not to discourage breach, \nbut breach can be “efficient.” Economists say that goods and services should be \nfree to flow to where they can be most efficiently used, not necessarily to where \nthey’ve been allocated by contract. For example, a person shouldn’t be discour -\naged from taking a better job out of fear of having to pay damages in excess of \nthe employer’s actual loss. The employee who leaves her employer in the lurch \nmay commit a moral wrong, but contract law is concerned only with the legal \nwrong — and that wrong can be righted with compensation.\nOne of the few times courts may award punitive damages is in bad-faith \ninsurance claims. If the insured person makes a valid claim but the insurance \ncompany refuses to pay in bad faith (with no good reason) and compels the \ninsured to sue in order to recover, the court may grant punitive damages to \ndiscourage this behavior from the insurance company. Some courts have \nsaid that punitive damages may be available when the parties have a “special \nrelationship,” but the only relationship that’s been found to clearly fit this \ncategory is between insurance company and insured. In addition, some  \nconsumer-protection statutes provide for punitive damages in order to dis -\ncourage a business from engaging in unfair or deceptive acts or practices.\n Of course, if you can make a claim for a tort (a wrongful act that results in \ninjury) that’s independent of the contract, you can bring a tort claim and pos -\nsibly receive punitive damages. Malpractice claims are a good example. If you \nhave a contract with a professional, such as a lawyer or a doctor, she prob -\nably breaches the contract when she doesn’t perform in a reasonable manner. \nYou could bring the claim for breach of contract, but bringing the claim in tort \nmay have its advantages, including the chance to recover for pain and suffer -\ning and to possibly receive punitive damages.\nFinding the Law that  \nGoverns the Contract\nThrough freedom of contract (see Chapter 10), parties may choose which \nset of rules govern the contract and where the trial is to take place in the \nevent of breach. How these two issues play out follows the usual pattern: The \ndefault rules are in place, but the parties are free (with certain exceptions, of \ncourse) to contract around those rules.\n298 Part V: Exploring Remedies for Breach of Contract \nWhen disputes arise over which set of rules govern the contract or the location \nof the forum for dispute, contract law offers some guidance, as I explain next.\nSelecting the governing law through  \na choice-of-law clause\nThe phrase choice of law  means choosing the law that governs any possible \ncontract disputes. A body of law called conflict of laws  governs the choice-of-\nlaw rules. Unfortunately, these rules aren’t very tidy when it comes to choos -\ning the law that governs a contract dispute, and different jurisdictions have \ndifferent rules. These rules can be divided into two categories, the old rule \nand the modern rule, as I explain in this section.\nExamining the old rule\nUnder the old rule,  the law that applies is the law of the place where the \nlast act occurred that resulted in contract formation. This act is usually the \nacceptance. If one party signs the contract in Ohio and the other signs in \nIndiana, the second signature is the acceptance (the contract is formed at \nthat point), so Indiana law governs. Drafters may manipulate this rule. For \nexample, the business in Ohio may add to the contract language stating, “No \ncontract is formed unless approved by our home office in Omaha, Nebraska.” \nIn that case, the contract is formed in Nebraska, so Nebraska law governs.\nThis rule isn’t very helpful in cases where the issue is whether a contract was \nformed. In the famous case of Leonard v. Pepsico,  for example, Pepsi claimed \nthat no contract was formed. The judge wasn’t sure which law to apply but \nsaid it didn’t really matter because the case concerned fundamental prin -\nciples of contract law that are pretty much the same everywhere.\nStudying the modern rule\nUnder the modern rule,  the law that applies is the law of the jurisdiction \nthat has the most significant contacts with the transaction. So if a builder in \nMontana agrees to build a home for a Washington resident in Idaho, and the \ncontract is signed in California, Idaho law would probably govern. Although \nfour states have contacts with the transaction, the most significant contacts \nare with Idaho, where the real property is located and the performance will \ntake place. In a contract for the sale of goods, the place where the goods are \ndelivered is generally the most significant contact.\nParties are generally free to use their freedom of contract to choose the law \nthat will govern their agreement as long as the contract has some reason -\nable connection with that jurisdiction. If, for example, parties in Montana \n299  Chapter 18: Checking for Additional Remedies\nwere to enter into a songwriting agreement, they could probably provide that \nCalifornia law governs the contract. Even though the contract doesn’t have \nany direct connection with that jurisdiction, providing for California law to \ngovern is reasonable because California has a significant body of law related \nto entertainment contracts, and Montana doesn’t.\n The parties can’t choose the law of a jurisdiction that offends the policy of the \nlaw of the jurisdiction whose law would’ve applied if the parties hadn’t chosen \nthe law. In other words, parties can’t expect a jurisdiction to apply laws that \noffend it. But a court can manipulate the rule in order to apply its own law  \nto the case.\n In a famous case involving the arbitration clause in a contract for a Subway \nsandwich shop franchise in Montana, the contract provided for Connecticut \nlaw, which is where Subway has its headquarters. This connection was strong \nenough to permit the parties to choose Connecticut law, but the Montana \ncourt objected to Connecticut’s policy of giving favorable treatment to arbi -\ntration clauses and refused to apply that law. Having thrown out the choice-\nof-law clause, it then applied the law of the jurisdiction that had the most \nsignificant contacts with the transaction — Montana!\n If a court is asked to apply law other than the  law of the forum  (the jurisdiction \nwhere the court is sitting), the lawyers must supply information about the law \nin that other jurisdiction to the court to aid its decision making. So if the rules \nof civil procedure lead you to litigate your case in Montana but you’ve agreed \nto apply California law, you have to educate the court on the relevant California \nlaw. This situation happens frequently in federal courts that often handle cases \nbased on diversity of citizenship. Federal contract law doesn’t exist, so the fed -\neral court must determine which state’s law applies to the transaction.\nSelecting the place of trial through  \na choice-of-forum clause\nWhereas a choice-of-law clause gets you the law you desire, a choice-of-forum  \nclause allows you to require that a suit be brought in a particular court. A \nparty may add such a provision to a contract because a particular forum is \nconvenient and perhaps provides a home-field advantage.\n The U.S. Supreme Court doesn’t hear many contracts cases (see why in \nChapter 1), but it does have jurisdiction over disputes that arise under admi -\nralty law  (law on the high seas). One such case involved a choice-of-forum \nclause. In Carnival Cruise Lines v. Shute,  Mrs. Shute was injured when she fell \non a Carnival ship at sea. The Shutes sued Carnival in Washington state, where",7966
96-Resolving a Dispute through Alternative Dispute Resolution.pdf,96-Resolving a Dispute through Alternative Dispute Resolution,"300 Part V: Exploring Remedies for Breach of Contract \nthe couple lived. But Carnival claimed they had to bring suit in Florida, where \nCarnival is headquartered, because the contract contained a choice-of-forum \nclause. The Shutes claimed the clause was unconscionable, because it was \nburied in the fine print of the contract and would cause inconvenience and \nfinancial hardship. The court nevertheless upheld the clause, explaining that \neven though the agreement was a contract of adhesion  (one party drafts it for \nthe other party to sign without negotiation), the clause was fair and the Shutes \nhad reason to know of it.\n A case decided by the Supreme Court in admiralty has mandatory authority \nonly in admiralty-law cases. State courts, or federal courts using state contract \nlaw in diversity cases, are free to ignore the holding of admiralty-law cases like \nthe Shute  case when deciding contracts cases. Nevertheless, such cases have \npersuasive authority.\nResolving a Dispute through Alternative \nDispute Resolution\nAlthough the default rule says that cases are heard in the court system, par -\nties are free to contractually opt out of the court system and agree on an \nalternative dispute resolution  (ADR) approach instead. They can bind them -\nselves in their contract to ADR, or they can agree to ADR after the dispute \narises. The two most common ADR methods are arbitration and mediation, \nwhich I describe in this section.\nLitigation is an all-or-nothing proposition, and many parties agree to a settle -\nment along the way. The court system often has procedures that encourage \nsettlement. Many court systems have procedural rules that require mediation \nat some point, and frequently they offer an arbitration alternative. For exam -\nple, if you go to small-claims court, the judge may give you the alternative of \nhaving the case heard by a volunteer arbitrator rather than the judge. In fact, \nthose TV show “judges” you see are really arbitrators who are resolving dis -\nputes that the parties have agreed to have heard by the arbitrator.\nResolving disputes through arbitration\nThe most common method of ADR is arbitration,  in which the parties refer \nthe case to a presumably impartial third party who acts like a judge and \ndecides the case. Arbitration is binding (most common) or nonbinding. With \nbinding arbitration,  the parties agree upfront that the arbitrator’s decision \ncan be entered and enforced just like a judgment in court. With nonbinding \n301  Chapter 18: Checking for Additional Remedies\narbitration, a party can opt out after the arbitrator presents her decision. In \nautomobile warranty disputes under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, for \nexample, the arbitrator’s decision is binding on the automobile manufacturer \nbut not on the consumer.\n If you’re negotiating a contract that has an arbitration clause, consider choos -\ning an arbitrator who brings particular expertise to the case. For example, if \nthe dispute is about a construction contract, you may want to choose some -\none who’s knowledgeable in construction matters.\nAlthough arbitration has some drawbacks, it offers the following benefits \nover litigation:\n ✓ Less expensive: You have to pay the arbitrator, which costs more than \nthe “free” judge, but you usually spend less on attorney’s fees and  \npre-trial procedures.\n ✓ Faster:  Arbitrators can limit or expedite the discovery  (pretrial proce -\ndures that enable a party to obtain information from the other party) \nthat bogs down so many court cases.\n ✓ More flexible:  Arbitrators aren’t bound by the rules of law, so they can \nbe more flexible in developing solutions to resolve the parties’ dispute. \nNor do arbitrators have to follow the rules of evidence, so the parties \nhave little to appeal from in an arbitrator’s decision — an error of law  \nis generally not appealable.\n ✓ Less formal: Arbitration proceedings are usually less formal than trials, \noften leading to a less adversarial and more collaborative atmosphere.\n ✓ Less controversial: Most arbitrator decisions simply say, “I find for A in \nthe amount of $X,” which gives the parties little to quarrel over.\n ✓ Private:  Arbitration is private, resulting in no public record of the  \nproceedings.\nIn the old days, courts were concerned that arbitrators were taking business \nfrom the courts, but now the diversion of cases from an overburdened court \nsystem is generally welcomed. No one objects to instances where the parties \nagree to take their dispute to arbitration after the dispute arises (as opposed \nto when they bind themselves ahead of time by contract).\nSo what’s not to like in arbitration? Sellers in consumer transactions often \ninclude an arbitration clause in a contract of adhesion to restrict the con -\nsumer’s options and avoid litigation. To protect a party that lacks bargaining \npower, a court may declare a term unconscionable (as I explain in Chapter 6), \nand some courts have used this power to strike down arbitration clauses.\n302 Part V: Exploring Remedies for Breach of Contract \nThe U.S. Supreme Court, however, has issued a string of opinions strongly \nsupporting arbitration by applying the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) to \narbitration cases in state courts. The FAA provides that a court may not \ninvalidate an arbitration clause “save upon such grounds as exist at law or \nin equity for the revocation of any contract.” In other words, a court can’t \nsay that the clause is unconscionable just because it’s an arbitration clause. \nAlthough this battle is likely to continue, courts are finding their hands tied \nin resisting arbitration clauses unless the arbitration clause itself is so one-\nsided as to be unconscionable.\nTrying mediation\nMediation  differs from arbitration in that the third party who was asked to \nmediate a dispute doesn’t have the power to make a decision that’s bind -\ning on the parties. Instead, the mediator tries to get the parties to reach a \nsettlement of their dispute that satisfies both parties’ interests. Sometimes \na contract provision requires the parties to mediate, but this provision only \nrequires them to make a good-faith effort to resolve their dispute. If they’re \nunable to reach an agreement, they’re free to walk away.\nMediators cite several benefits of mediation over litigation:\n ✓ Personal empowerment:  Parties have more control over the dispute \nresolution process. They don’t simply hand the dispute over to lawyers \nto resolve.\n ✓ More conducive to peacemaking:  Mediation is less adversarial and \nmore collaborative. The focus isn’t on winning but on finding a solution \nthat’s mutually satisfactory.\n ✓ More-durable solutions:  The parties take ownership of the dispute and \nthe resolution of it, so they tend to buy into the solution. As a result, the \nparties are more likely to comply with and less likely to appeal the  \ndecision.\n ✓ Fewer unresolved issues:  Often disputes are about more than money \ndamages. Mediation enables the parties to address personal losses and \nemotional issues that fall outside the law. Parties are able to mend their \nrelationship or part on more amicable terms.",7238

For \nexample, third parties may have an interest in enforcing a warranty (see \nChapter 18 for details). If I give you food at my house and the food makes you \nsick, you may want to bring a claim against the seller who sold me the food, \neven though you’re not a party to the contract between me and the seller, \nmaking you a third party. Provisions in the UCC resolve whether you can \nbring such a claim.\nThird parties may also get involved in other ways — by becoming third-party \nbeneficiaries, by interfering in the performance of a contract between two \nother parties, or by having the rights or duties of the contract assigned or \ndelegated to them. This chapter focuses on third-party beneficiaries and \npeople who interfere in another parties’ contract by inducing one of them \nto breach. Here, you find out how to determine whether someone is a third-\nparty beneficiary. You also see the potential consequences a third party may \nsuffer as a result of interfering in a contract between other parties. (For more \nabout assignment and delegation, see Chapter 20.)\n306 Part VI: Bringing Third Parties into the Picture \nDetermining Whether a Party  \nIs a Third-Party Beneficiary\nIn a third-party beneficiary  transaction, a party who’s not a party to the con -\ntract sues to enforce a promise that one of the parties made. Contract law \nhad trouble finding a theoretical justification to allow this but ultimately \nallows it as part of the role of contract law to carry out the parties’ intent.\nEveryone agrees that whether a party is a third-party beneficiary hinges on \nwhether the parties intended that party to be a third-party beneficiary of \nthe promise. The challenge is to find that intent. The Second Restatement of \nContracts (which has been around since 1981 and has become so familiar that \nI simply call it the Restatement ) takes a somewhat circular approach to this \nproblem. In § 302, the Restatement creates two categories of beneficiaries: \nintended and incidental. It goes on to say that a beneficiary of a promise is an \nintended beneficiary if the parties so intend and one of the following applies:\n(a) the performance of the promise will satisfy an obligation of the  \npromisee to pay money to the beneficiary; or\n(b) the circumstances indicate that the promisee intends to give the  \nbeneficiary the benefit of the promised performance.\nThe First Restatement of Contracts, which came out in the 1920s, is some -\nwhat more helpful because it provides names for these two categories of \nthird-party beneficiaries:\n ✓ Creditor beneficiary (a):  One to whom one of the parties to the contract \nowed money that he arranged to pay\n ✓ Donor beneficiary (b):  One to whom the parties to the contract \nintended to make a gift\nThis section explores these two categories in turn, describes a third category \nfor parties who have only an incidental interest in the contract, and introduces \nthree key questions you can ask to determine whether a third party is likely to \nqualify as a third-party beneficiary. It also discusses the rights of third-party \nbeneficiaries and whether the parties to the contract can change those rights.\nCreating a creditor beneficiary by  \ntelling someone to pay your debt\nThe parties intend to create a creditor beneficiary when performance of the \npromise will satisfy the promisee’s obligation to pay money to the beneficiary. \n307\nChapter 19: Deciding Whether a Third Party Can Enforce or Interfere with a Contract\nIn other words, A and B make a contract in which B promises A that he’ll do \nsomething for C. They intend to make C a creditor beneficiary if B’s perfor -\nmance will satisfy an obligation of A to pay money to C.\n For example, John owes Terry $100. John sells a widget to Peter for $100 and as \npart of the contract, John tells Peter to pay the $100 to Terry rather than to John. \nPeter doesn’t pay. Terry asks whether she can sue Peter for the $100. Terry is \nobviously a third party, but contract law must determine whether she qualifies \nas a third-party beneficiary, which she must be in order to have the right to sue.\nHere’s how to determine whether the parties to a contract intended to create \na creditor beneficiary:\n 1. Identify the promise that the third party is seeking to enforce.\n  In this example, Terry is seeking to enforce Peter’s promise to John.\n 2. Ask whether the performance of the promise will satisfy an obligation \nof the promisee to pay money to the beneficiary.\n  Yes, the performance will satisfy John’s obligation to pay Terry. \nTherefore, Terry is a creditor beneficiary and, as a third-party benefi -\nciary, can sue Peter to enforce the promise.\nSecuring the rights of third-party beneficiaries\nFor a long time, American contract law had a \nhard time recognizing the rights of third-party \nbeneficiaries simply because it couldn’t see \nhow a person who wasn’t a party to the con -\ntract could sue to enforce the contract. The \nprincipal case that changed the rule in the U.S. \nwas the 1859 New York case of Lawrence v. \nFox. Holly owed Lawrence $300. Holly loaned \nFox $300, and in return, Fox promised to pay \nthe $300 to Lawrence to satisfy Holly’s debt to \nLawrence. When Fox didn’t pay him, Lawrence \nsued Fox.\nThe court had trouble finding consideration \nfrom Lawrence that would allow him to enforce Fox’s promise to someone else. But it claimed it \nfound a principle in the law of trusts that in the \ncase of “a promise made to one for the benefit \nof another, he for whose benefit it is made may \nbring an action for its breach.” This sounds like \na conclusion rather than a justification, but the \nlong and short of it is that the promise became \nenforceable.\nCuriously, two years later an English court \ndecided on similar facts that the beneficiary \ncouldn’t recover. Third-party beneficiaries \nin England finally got the right to enforce \nthe promises through legislation rather than \nthrough court decisions.\n308 Part VI: Bringing Third Parties into the Picture \n This situation arises in many real-world transactions, such as real estate con -\ntracts. Suppose I buy a house from you, and in the process, I take out a $100,000 \nmortgage from the bank. I then sell the house to Terry, and she assumes the \nmortgage; that is, she promises me that she’ll pay the bank. However, she \ndoesn’t pay the bank. The bank can still come after me (if you don’t understand \nwhy, see Chapter 20), but the bank wants to know whether it can go after Terry. \nHere’s how to decide whether the bank is a third-party beneficiary:\n 1. Identify the promise that the bank is seeking to enforce: Terry’s promise \nto pay the bank.\n 2. Ask whether the performance of the promise will satisfy an obligation of \nthe promisee (me) to pay money to the beneficiary (the bank). Yes, that’s \nwhy I got Terry to make the promise to me. Therefore, the bank is a third-\nparty beneficiary and can sue Terry to enforce the promise. (By the way, \nmost mortgages today have a provision expressly saying that the mort -\ngage isn’t assumable and that the balance is due on sale of the property.)\nCreating a donor beneficiary  \nby making a gift\nAccording to the Restatement, a third party is a third-party beneficiary if “the \npromisee intends to give the beneficiary the benefit of the promised perfor -\nmance.” This third party is referred to as a donor beneficiary  (donor  meaning \nthe giver of a gift). In other words, A and B make a contract in which A gets B \nto promise to give something to C.\n For example, John sells a widget to Peter for $100. As part of the contract, \nJohn tells Peter to pay that $100 to John’s favorite charity. Peter doesn’t pay. \nThe charity asks whether it can sue Peter for the $100.\nTo determine whether the parties to a contract intended to create a donor \nbeneficiary, here’s what you do:\n 1. Identify the promise that the third party is seeking to enforce.\n  The charity wants to enforce Peter’s promise to pay the charity $100.\n 2. Ask whether the promisee intends to give the beneficiary the benefit \nof the promised performance.\n  Yes, John (the promisee) said he intends to give the charity (the benefi -\nciary) the benefit of the $100. Therefore, the charity is a donor beneficiary \nand, as a third-party beneficiary, can sue Peter to enforce the promise.\nThe most common example of a donor beneficiary is the beneficiary in a life \ninsurance policy. I agree to pay the insurance company a premium in return \nfor its promise to pay my beneficiary upon my death. The third party is \n309\nChapter 19: Deciding Whether a Third Party Can Enforce or Interfere with a Contract\nclearly an intended beneficiary and can sue to enforce the insurance compa -\nny’s promise. Notice that the beneficiary gave no consideration in return for \nbeing named as a beneficiary. As I explain in Chapter 3, this is a gift promise \nand is not binding. Therefore, I can generally revoke (take back) this prom -\nise to make someone my beneficiary, such as by designating a new benefi -\nciary. However, my promise may be enforceable on a theory of reliance (see \nChapter 4 for details on reliance).\nCreating an incidental beneficiary: \nAnother name for loser\nAfter defining what qualifies someone as a third-party beneficiary, the \nRestatement says that if you’re not a third-party beneficiary, you’re an incidental \nbeneficiary,  which really means you’re a loser — you have no right to enforce the \ncontract. To determine whether someone’s an incidental beneficiary, look for a \nthird party who benefits from the contract and then ask whether the reason the \nparties entered into the contract was to benefit that third party. If the answer is \nno, then the third party is an incidental beneficiary.\n For example, suppose I hire you to do some research for me for the summer. \nI promise that in payment, I’ll buy you a new Mercedes from Midtown Motors. \nNeedless to say, you accept my offer. You do a fantastic job on the research, \nand I say, “Let’s go down and pick out that Mercedes.” You say, “Professor \nBurnham, I didn’t do it for the Mercedes. I did it for the love of contract law. \nThat’s good enough for me, and you don’t have to get me the Mercedes.” You’re \nhappy, I’m happy, but unfortunately the third party to our contract, Midtown \nMotors, is unhappy. They sue to enforce the contract, claiming to be a third-\nparty beneficiary. Would they have benefitted from performance of the con -\ntract? Yes, indeed. Did we enter the contract with the intention of benefitting \nthem? Nope. That makes Midtown Motors an incidental beneficiary — they lose.\nAsking three key questions to identify \nthird-party beneficiaries\nAs a quick check to determine the likelihood that a third party qualifies as a \nthird-party beneficiary, ask the three questions I present in this section. The \nanswers to these questions won’t give you a definitive determination, but \nthey can be helpful in making the determination.\nIs the third party named in the contract?\nA third-party beneficiary is usually named in the contract. This alone isn’t \nenough to make someone a third-party beneficiary, however. When you name \nthe beneficiary of an insurance policy, you most certainly intend that party \n310 Part VI: Bringing Third Parties into the Picture \nto be a third-party beneficiary. But if I name Midtown Motors as the place I’ll \npurchase a car to pay you for your research work, I probably didn’t intend \nMidtown Motors to be a third-party beneficiary. The intent all depends on the \ncontext in which that party is named.\n When writing a contract that names a beneficiary, consider adding that the \nparties expressly do or do not intend the party to be a third-party beneficiary.\nDoes performance run to that third party?\nAnother test is whether performance of the contract runs to that third party. \nIf so, an intent to benefit that party is more likely. In a life insurance contract, \nthe insurer will perform directly to that third party (the beneficiary) by \npaying that person the money. In our research contract, in which I promise \nto buy you a car in payment for your work, my performance runs to you, not \nto Midtown Motors. (We could say it runs through  them but not to them.)\n In a case where an insurance company promised the buyer of an automobile \nthat it would provide liability insurance, a person injured by the buyer sued \nthe insurance company. Obviously, the injured person was not specifically \nnamed in the contract, but the purpose of the contract was to compensate \nthose who were injured by the buyer, so that was close enough to name the \ninjured person as a third-party beneficiary.\nThis issue of who performance runs to sometimes comes up with govern -\nment contracts that intend to serve a public interest. Did the government \nintend to benefit those directly affected by the contract or to benefit the gen -\neral welfare? Courts have generally determined that such a contract wasn’t \nintended to benefit any particular person unless the terms of the contract \nprovided for that.\n For example, suppose the government contracts with a business to retrain \nunemployed workers in a particular city, and the business doesn’t do it. Do the \nunemployed workers have a claim against the business? Probably not. The gov -\nernment’s intent in contracting with the business was to serve the general good \nby reducing unemployment, not to benefit any particular unemployed worker.\nDid the promisee intend to benefit the third party?\nQuestions about third-party beneficiaries all come back to intent. One way \nto focus on that intent is to think of the promise from the point of view of \nthe promisee — the one to whom the promise was made. If someone is a \nthird-party beneficiary, then the scope of the promisor’s obligation has been \nexpanded from the promisee to the third party as well.\nAfter that’s been established, ask whether the promisee bargained for that \nexpanded obligation. In the case of the auto insurance policy, that answer is \neasy, because the promisee sought the promise of the insurance company \nto benefit the injured party in case of an accident. But if you agreed to be my",14719

Probably not. You were most likely looking  \nafter yourself.\nChanging a third-party beneficiary’s rights\nThe parties to a contract are generally free to modify their contract, changing \ntheir duties to each other, as I explain in Chapter 12. Similarly, the parties are \ngenerally free to change the beneficiary of a contract. However, exceptions \narise when the rights of the beneficiary are said to have vested,  meaning they \ncan’t be changed without her consent.\nThe rights of a beneficiary usually vest in the following situations:\n ✓ Express agreement:  A term in the contract provides that the beneficiary \ncan’t be changed.\n ✓ Reliance:  The beneficiary changes her position in reliance on the promise.\n Changing a named beneficiary can be an issue with life insurance policies. \nIf the beneficiary of a life insurance contract has relied on the promise, the \ninsured may not be able to change the duty to the beneficiary — for example, \nby changing the person named as beneficiary. In many jurisdictions, courts \nfound that the insured was unable to change the beneficiary unless he or she \nreserved that power in the policy. Most policies now provide that the insured \nparty has the power to change the beneficiary.\nInterfering with Someone Else’s  \nContract: A Big No-No\nTortious interference  arises when a third party induces one of the parties to \nthe contract to breach the contract. This gives the injured party a couple of \noptions: She can sue the party to the contract for breach of contract, and she \ncan sue the third party for tortious interference with contract.\n Tortious interference is a tort claim, not a contract claim. Some describe it as \na “business tort,” and maybe because tortious interference is less common \nthan other torts, it’s often not studied in Contracts or Torts classes. But it’s \nimportant because a person may not be aware that he’s setting himself up for \na tort claim when he induces a party to breach a contract. Of course, the tort \nis committed only when the interference is “improper,” and the problem that \nusually arises is in trying to determine whether the person’s interference was \nimproper or justified.\n312 Part VI: Bringing Third Parties into the Picture \nThis section explains how to recognize tortious interference with a contract \nand how the courts determine whether such interference is improper.\nFinding the tort of tortious  \ninterference with contract\nA party can’t get punitive damages for a breach of contract claim. However, \na party may be able to get punitive damages for proving an intentional  tort \n(wrongful act resulting in injury), such as tortious interference with contract.\nIn fact, one of the biggest judgments in U.S. legal history came when Pennzoil \nsued Texaco for tortious interference with its contract to buy Getty Oil. The \njury found Texaco liable for tortious interference and assessed damages of \nmore than $10.5 billion (reduced to a mere $8.5 billion on appeal), forcing \nTexaco into bankruptcy.\nRestatement of Torts § 766 describes  tortious interference:\nOne who intentionally and improperly interferes with the performance of a \ncontract (except a contract to marry) between another and a third person \nby inducing or otherwise causing the third person not to perform the con -\ntract, is subject to liability to the other for the pecuniary loss resulting to \nthe other from the failure of the third person to perform the contract.\nWhy is the contract to marry exempt?\nMarriage is at root a contract. Think of grounds \nfor annulment as circumstances that avoid \nthe contract, and think of grounds for divorce \nas material breach of the contract. No-fault \ndivorce is mutual rescission.\nIn the old days, a person who had a romantic \nrelationship with one of the parties was liable \nfor tortious interference with the marriage \ncontract. The tort was called alienation of \naffections  or criminal conversation,  suggest -\ning that it could be a crime as well. Nowadays, \nalthough we don’t condone this behavior, most \njurisdictions have statutes that bar civil or \ncriminal liability for it.Engagement to marry is also a contract. But if \none party breaks off the engagement, the other \nparty usually can’t sue for damages for breach \nof contract. The so-called heartbalm statutes  in \nmost jurisdictions have eliminated that claim, \nwith the exception of recovering out-of-pocket \nexpenses incurred in preparing for the wedding.\nTortious interference can apply to interference \nwith the formation of a contract, just as it can \napply to the contract itself. In the movies, the \nhero is always sweeping in at the last moment \nto snatch the bride away from Mr. Wrong. \nThis sounds like tortious interference, but the \nRestatement specifically provides that this \nbehavior carries no tort liability.\n313\nChapter 19: Deciding Whether a Third Party Can Enforce or Interfere with a Contract\nThe most difficult of these elements to prove is that the interference was \nimproper, because the party who interfered usually claims that its interfer -\nence was justified. The next section tackles that issue.\nConsidering claims that the  \ninterference is improper\nThe defendant in a tortious interference claim usually defends by saying that \nif it did interfere, its interference was not improper but justified. For example, \nnot long ago, every night people across America got annoying phone calls \nat dinnertime with offers from long-distance services. Everyone already had \na long-distance service, so if you accepted one of these offers, you had to \nbreak your existing contract with another service. Although the calls may \nlook like tortious interference, they were probably not heavy-handed enough \nto qualify as improper. The company offering the service could claim that its \naction was justified by free enterprise, with competing parties free to offer \ntheir wares to customers, who could then decide whether they wanted to get \nout of their existing contracts in order to accept.\n A more heavy-handed example was dramatized in the movie The Insider.  \nJeffrey Wigand was a scientist employed by Brown & Williamson Tobacco \nCompany. In his contract, he promised not to divulge corporate secrets to \nanyone. Nevertheless, he made some disclosures to the CBS team that pro -\nduces 60 Minutes.  Brown & Williamson could’ve sued Wigand for breach of \ncontract, but they went after the deeper pocket: They threatened to sue CBS \nfor tortious interference. CBS’s defense would’ve been that they’re in the news \nbusiness and the public had a right to know this information. Nevertheless, \nthe threat worked, and 60 Minutes  didn’t air the episode.\n The case of Phillips v. Montana Educational Association  (MEA) is not an impor -\ntant one, but it nicely illustrates the analysis of a claim for tortious interfer -\nence with contract. Phillips was an employee of the MEA who was fired. \nInstead of suing his employer for breach of contract, he sued the Board of \nDirectors of the Association for tortious interference with contract. Clearly  \nhe and the Association had a contract, and the directors had caused it to be \nterminated. The only issue was whether their action was improper.\nThe court found that the duty of the board of directors of a corporation is to \nact in the best interests of that corporation. It may be in the best interests \nof the corporation to breach a contract the corporation has with some other \nparty. As long as they were acting in good faith, then the board of directors \nwas justified in inducing the corporation to breach the contract with Phillips.\n314 Part VI: Bringing Third Parties into the Picture",7941

101-Determining Whether Rights May Be Assigned.pdf,101-Determining Whether Rights May Be Assigned,"Chapter 20\nAcknowledging the Rights  \nand Duties of Third Parties\nIn This Chapter\n▶ Getting to know each party’s rights and duties\n▶ Recognizing when a party can or can’t assign rights to a third party\n▶ Knowing when a party can or can’t delegate duties to a third party\n▶ Novation: Rewriting a contract to remove a party\nT \nhe parties to a contract may assign their rights or delegate their duties \nto a third party. For example, if Acorn Industries buys out Hickory, Inc., \nthen Acorn buys Hickory’s contract rights and obligations. If prior to the \nbuyout, Hickory had contracted with Filberts to purchase 3,000 rubber duck -\nies for $1,250, then Hickory assigns to third-party Acorn its right to purchase \nthose rubber duckies, and it delegates to Acorn its duty to pay the $1,250 to \nFilberts. Likewise, Hickory assigns its right to the services of its employees to \nAcorn, and it delegates its duty to pay those employees to Acorn.\nThis chapter describes what constitutes each party’s rights and duties under \ntheir contract and explains how to determine when a party to the contract \nis allowed to assign her rights or delegate her duties or is prohibited from \ndoing so. You also find out how to write language into a contract that pro -\nhibits assignment or delegation or both, and you see how to remove a party \nfrom a contract so the person no longer has the duty to perform under it.\nBreaking Down a Contract  \ninto Rights and Duties\nBefore trying to figure out whether a party to a contract is allowed to assign \nhis rights or delegate his duties to a third party, you need to be able to recog -\nnize each party’s rights and duties as specified in the contract:\n316 Part VI: Bringing Third Parties into the Picture \n ✓ Right:  As a promisee in a contract, a party has the right to the  \npromisor’s performance.\n ✓ Duty:  As a promisor, a party has the duty to perform.\nAfter you’ve identified what constitutes the rights and duties of each party, \nyou can develop a better understanding of how the parties may be able to \ntransfer those rights and duties to a third party.\n The following examples examine rights and duties in three different types of \ncontracts: the sale of goods, construction, and services.\nIn a contract in which a seller agrees to sell a buyer all the widgets it requires \nfor $100 each, the buyer’s and seller’s rights and duties look like this:\nRight Duty\nBuyer Receive the widgets Pay for widgets\nSeller Receive the payment Tender the widgets\nIn a contract in which a builder agrees to build a house for an owner for \n$300,000, the builder’s and owner’s rights and duties look like this:\nRight Duty\nBuilder Receive $300,000 Build the house\nHomeowner Get the house Pay $300,000\nIn a contract in which a famous artist agrees to paint the president’s portrait \nfor $50,000, the president’s and painter’s rights and duties look like this:\nRight Duty\nPresident Have his portrait painted Pay $50,000\nPainter Receive $50,000 Paint the portrait\nDetermining Whether Rights  \nMay Be Assigned\nA contract right is a piece of property that can be bought and sold. The party \nto the contract that assigns the right is the assignor,  and the third party who \nreceives the right is the assignee.\n If you took out a student loan from Bank A, for example, you might receive a \nletter from the bank telling you that from now on, you should send your pay -\nment to Bank B rather than Bank A. What happened behind the scenes is that \n317  Chapter 20: Acknowledging the Rights and Duties of Third Parties\nBank A had a contract with you and assigned the right to receive your payments \nunder that contract to Bank B. After you get an effective notice of the assign -\nment, you should perform for the assignee, Bank B, which now has the right to \nyour performance. Transfers of the right to receive money constitute a substan -\ntial part of the world economy.\nThis section explains how contract law applies the general rule and examines \nexceptions to that rule.\nApplying the general rule:  \nFreely assigning rights\n The general rule is that parties may freely assign contract rights. The assignee \n“stands in the shoes of the assignor,” who essentially drops out of the picture. \nThis rule is pretty much the same in the common law and in the Code. You \ncan find it in the UCC in § 2-210(2). As enacted in North Carolina at 25-2-210(2), \nit provides in part:\n(2) Unless otherwise agreed all rights of either seller or buyer can be \nassigned except where the assignment would materially change the duty \nof the other party, or increase materially the burden or risk imposed  \non him by his contract, or impair materially his chance of obtaining \nreturn performance.\nThe right to receive money is an example of a freely assignable right. \nApplying the general rule, you can see that assigning this right doesn’t mate -\nrially change the duty of the obligor  (the party who promised to perform), \nbecause it’s just as easy for the obligor to pay the assignee as to pay the \nassignor. All three hypothetical contracts in the earlier section “Breaking \nDown a Contract into Rights and Duties” contain a right to receive money.\nWhen the right involves something other than receiving money, assignment \ncan be more problematic, as I explain next.\nSpotting exceptions to the  \nassignment of rights\nAs the UCC states, the rule of free assignment of rights has a number of \nexceptions. One is the usual exception to default rules: The parties can agree \nto some other arrangement in their contract (see “Prohibiting Assignment \nand Delegation,” later in this chapter, for details). The other exceptions  \noccur when the assignment would do one of the following:\n318 Part VI: Bringing Third Parties into the Picture \n ✓ “Materially change the duty of the other party”\n ✓ “Increase materially the burden or risk imposed on him by his contract, \nor impair materially his chance of obtaining return performance”\n Here’s how these exceptions might play out in the three examples I introduce \nearlier in the section “Breaking Down a Contract into Rights and Duties”:\n ✓ Potential changes in quantity — a material change in duty:  In a normal \nsituation for the sale of goods, the buyer can often assign its right to \nreceive the goods, as long as delivery to the assignee isn’t any more \ndifficult for the seller as a result. But consider an example in which the \nseller is obligated to tender all the widgets the buyer requires. In this \nrequirements contract, the quantity to be supplied depends on the buy -\ner’s needs (see Chapter 2 for details on requirements contracts).\n  Assume that a giant corporation buys out the business that originally \ncontracted to buy the widgets. The original buyer assigns the rights \nunder its contracts to the business that takes it over. The new company \nwould then tell the seller under the widgets contract that the right to \nall the widgets the business requires have now been assigned to it. This \ncould disrupt the seller’s expectations, because it probably entered \nthe contract based on the size of the original buyer’s business. It could \nobject to the assignment on the grounds that the assignment materially \nchanged its duty.\n ✓ Reducing the assignor’s motivation to pay — impaired chances of \nreturn performance:  In the construction example, a builder agrees to \nbuild a house for an owner for $300,000. Suppose the owner tells the \ncontractor that he has assigned the right to have the house built to his \nneighbor, who owns a nearby lot. Even though building the house for \nthe neighbor is no more difficult for the contractor, the original owner \nnow has no incentive to pay for the house, because this was an assign -\nment of the right to get the house, not a delegation of the duty to pay. So \nthe contractor may claim that the assignment has impaired his chance \nof getting the return performance of payment.\n ✓ Choice of person — a material change in duty: In the artist example, \nan artist is to paint the president’s portrait. This is a personal services \ncontract. If the president decides he doesn’t have time to get his portrait \npainted, he might tell the painter, “I’ve assigned my right to Professor \nBurnham. Paint his portrait instead.” Although painting my portrait \nwould be no more difficult for the painter, he can object to the assign -\nment on the grounds that the contract involved a choice of person  — it \nmattered to him who he was going to paint.",8557
102-Determining Whether Duties May Be Delegated.pdf,102-Determining Whether Duties May Be Delegated,"319  Chapter 20: Acknowledging the Rights and Duties of Third Parties\nDetermining Whether Duties  \nMay Be Delegated\nThe general rule in contract law is that parties may freely delegate their \nduties under the contract. The party doing the delegating is the delegating \nparty  or delegator,  and the one to whom the duty is delegated is the delegate  \nor delegatee.\n The big difference between assigning rights and delegating duties is that the \nassignee takes the place of the assignor, whereas the delegatee doesn’t take \nthe place of the delegator; hence, the delegating party remains liable for per -\nformance and breach. In other words, an obligor can’t get out of his contrac -\ntual duties by delegating them.\nThis section examines how contract law applies the general rule and looks at \nexceptions to that rule when parties delegate their duties.\nApplying the general rule:  \nFreely delegating duties\nThe rule allowing parties to freely delegate their duties under the contract is \nessentially the same in the common law and the Code. You can find it in the \nUCC in § 2-210(1). As enacted in North Carolina at 25-2-210(1), it provides:\n(1) A party may perform his duty through a delegate unless otherwise \nagreed or unless the other party has a substantial interest in having his \noriginal promisor perform or control the acts required by the contract. \nNo delegation of performance relieves the party delegating of any duty  \nto perform or any liability for breach.\n You may be surprised that duties can be so easily delegated, but when you \nthink about it, this happens all the time. For example, you’re working for \nHomebrew Software. On Friday, you get notice that Megasoft has taken over \nthe company, and starting Monday, you’ll be working for them. What’s hap -\npened is that Homebrew assigned its right to your services and delegated \nthe duty to pay you to Megasoft. You may despise Megasoft, but that doesn’t \nmatter. As long as your duties are unchanged, contract law says that the party \nyou perform for makes no difference. And as long as you’re paid, who’s paying \nyou doesn’t matter.\n320 Part VI: Bringing Third Parties into the Picture \nConstruction contracts commonly employ delegation. An owner probably \nhires a particular contractor, such as ABC Construction, because she heard \nthat they’re very reliable and do excellent work. Imagine her surprise when \nXYZ Construction shows up to do some of the work. But the delegation of \nperformance of parts of a construction contract is very common. That’s what \nsubcontracting  is all about: The prime contractor has delegated some of its \nduties to the subcontractor.\n One of the reasons subcontracting is widely permitted is that the original \nparty remains liable for performance and breach, even after the delegation. \nBecause ABC Construction promised the owner they would do the job, dele -\ngating their duties to XYZ Construction doesn’t relieve ABC of that obligation, \nand they can be sued for XYZ’s breach.\nBack to the source: Spotting exceptions  \nto the delegation of duties\nThe exception to free delegation arises when the “other party has a sub -\nstantial interest in having his original promisor perform or control the acts \nrequired by the contract.” With the sale of goods, a seller is generally free to \ndelegate his duty to tender the goods, because if the goods are  fungible  (the \nsame regardless of the source), who provides them makes little difference. \nOn the other hand, if the source of the goods or services makes a substantial \ndifference in performance, then the party can’t delegate the duty.\n For example, suppose the famous artist tells the president, “I’ve delegated my \nduty to paint your portrait to someone else.” Even if that person was a repu -\ntable artist, the president would likely object, claiming he had a substantial \ninterest in having his original promisor perform because of that person’s par -\nticular abilities as an artist.\n In Macke Co. v. Pizza of Gaithersburg, Inc.,  a company called Virginia had a \ncontract to install and service vending machines at Pizza’s pizza shops. Macke \nthen purchased Virginia’s assets, which included an assignment of Virginia’s \nrights, including the right to receive money from Pizza, and a delegation of \nVirginia’s duties, including the obligation to install and service Pizza’s vending \nmachines. Pizza refused to accept performance from Macke, claiming that the \ndelegation was not effective, and Macke sued for breach.\nThe trial court found that because Pizza had picked Virginia on account of  \nits skill, judgment, and reputation, the contract involved a choice of person, \nso the duties couldn’t be delegated. But the appellate court explained that \neven though services were involved, this was the kind of service that any",4858
103-Prohibiting Assignment and Delegation.pdf,103-Prohibiting Assignment and Delegation,"321  Chapter 20: Acknowledging the Rights and Duties of Third Parties\ncompany in that line of business could perform. The court cited language \nfrom a California case that held that duties under a contract to grade a street \ncould be delegated:\nAll painters do not paint portraits like Sir Joshua Reynolds, nor land -\nscapes like Claude Lorraine, nor do all writers write dramas like \nShakespeare or fiction like Dickens. Rare genius and extraordinary skill \nare not transferable, and contracts for their employment are therefore \npersonal, and cannot be assigned. But rare genius and extraordinary skill \nare not indispensable to the workmanlike digging down of a sand hill or \nthe filling up of a depression to a given level, or the construction of brick \nsewers with manholes and covers, and contracts for such work are not \npersonal, and may be assigned.\nUsing UCC § 2-609 to get assurances\nIf the contract doesn’t involve fungible goods, a buyer may be concerned \nabout whether the delegate is going to do the job. Sure, the buyer can always \nsue the delegating party in the event of breach, but she doesn’t want a law -\nsuit; she wants performance. A party who’s concerned that the other party \nmay not perform can demand assurances, as I explain in Chapter 15.\nThe Code provides for a party in this situation to similarly demand assur -\nances from the delegate. UCC § 2-210(6), as enacted in North Carolina at  \n25-2-210(1), provides:\n(6) The other party may treat any assignment which delegates perfor -\nmance as creating reasonable grounds for insecurity and may without \nprejudice to his rights against the assignor demand assurances from the \nassignee (Section 2-609).\n For example, if I ordered food from a certain caterer and the caterer later \ntells me that another caterer will be providing the food, I may be concerned \nbecause I was relying on the reputation of the original caterer. I could demand \nassurances from the new caterer, and if I didn’t get reasonable assurances, \nthen I could regard the delegation as ineffective.\nProhibiting Assignment and Delegation\nAs with most default rules, the rules on assignment and delegation are gener -\nally subject to the agreement of the parties. The parties may put language \nin the contract to prohibit assignment and delegation. This section explains \n322 Part VI: Bringing Third Parties into the Picture \nhow to draft language to prohibit assignment and delegation and describes \nthe limitations that pertain to such prohibitions.\nDrafting an effective prohibition\n When drafting a prohibition, use specific language to clearly express what the \nparties intend to prohibit: assignment of rights, delegation of duties, or both. If \nyou want to prohibit both assignment and delegation, for example, spell it out \nby saying, “Rights under this contract may not be assigned, and duties under \nthis contract may not be delegated.”\n Don’t draft something vague like “This contract may not be assigned.” \nContracts are not assigned; rights are. Did the drafter mean to prohibit the \nassignment of rights, the delegation of duties, or both? This problem arises  \nso often that the UCC has a rule that addresses it. UCC § 2-210(4), as  \nenacted in North Carolina at 25-2-210(4), provides:\n(4) Unless the circumstances indicate the contrary a prohibition of \nassignment of “the contract” is to be construed as barring only the  \ndelegation to the assignee of the assignor’s performance.\nUnder this rule, if you prohibit “assignment of the contract,” the result is \nthat you’ve prohibited only the delegation of duties and not the assignment \nof rights. Although this result may seem surprising, it makes sense in light of \nthe rules of interpretation I explain in Chapter 11. The goal of interpretation \nis to carry out the intent of the parties. Parties are generally more concerned \nabout delegation than assignment, so they probably intended only to pro -\nhibit delegation. Furthermore, because the general policy is to permit assign -\nment and delegation, this interpretation supports that policy by giving the \nlanguage a narrow reading.\nRecognizing key limitations on prohibition\nBecause contract law strongly supports assignment and delegation, parties \nmay encounter limitations on their ability to prohibit assignment and delega -\ntion. The two key limitations are these:\n ✓ Limitations on prohibiting the assignment of the right to receive money\n ✓ Limitations on the remedy, even if a prohibition is effective\nThis section explains these limitations in detail.\n323  Chapter 20: Acknowledging the Rights and Duties of Third Parties\nRestricting the assignment of the right to receive money\nThe right to receive money for goods sold or services rendered on credit \nis called an account.  Businesses commonly sell their accounts or use their \naccounts as collateral to secure a loan — a practice known as accounts receiv -\nable financing, which is an important part of commerce.\n A gym, for example, having gotten you to sign a contract for a year’s member -\nship at $100 per month, has an account — the right to receive $1,200 from you \nover the next 12 months. It can convert that contract to cash now by selling \nthe contract rights at a discounted (reduced) rate (say, $1,000) or by bor -\nrowing money and using the account as collateral. The buyer or lender, as an \nassignee, can then go after you if you don’t pay.\n To prevent restrictions on accounts receivable financing, Article 9 of the \nUCC provides that prohibitions on assignment aren’t effective with respect \nto contracts used in financing. For example, if a contract for the sale of goods \ncontains a provision that states, “Rights under this agreement may not be \nassigned,” then the buyer would be prohibited from assigning its right to \nreceive the goods. However, the seller still would be able to assign its right \nto receive the money in order to get financing, because that prohibition on \nassignment isn’t enforceable.\nFiguring the consequences of breach of a prohibition\nNot all courts agree on the effect of the breach of a clause that prohibits \nassignment and delegation. The majority rule is that the assignment or  \ndelegation is still effective, but the other party can recover damages. The \nminority rule is that the assignment or delegation is not effective.\n For example, you contract to have work done by ABC Construction, and \nyou don’t want them to subcontract the work. You put in the contract, \n“Duties under this contract may not be delegated.” You then see that XYZ \nConstruction is doing the work. Under the majority rule, the delegation is \neffective and you’re entitled to any damages. This rule makes little sense to \nme, because you’re entitled to damages anyway if XYZ doesn’t perform prop -\nerly, so the prohibition doesn’t get you anything. Under the minority rule, the \ndelegation is not effective and you can refuse to accept performance by XYZ.\n If you’re in a jurisdiction where the only consequence is damages, you can put \nlanguage in the contract to provide for the consequences you intend. You can \nsay something like, “Duties under this contract may not be delegated, and any \nattempted delegation is ineffective.”\nIf the other party breaches the contract by delegating their duty when the \ncontact says they can’t delegate, that’s probably not enough to allow the",7440
104-Part VII The Part of Tens.pdf,104-Part VII The Part of Tens,"324 Part VI: Bringing Third Parties into the Picture \nnon-breaching party to terminate the contract. You can terminate a contract \nonly if the other party commits a material breach, and breaching the clause \nprohibiting delegation is probably not material. However, you’re free to draft \nan express condition to that effect (see Chapter 14 for details). You can say \nsomething like, “Duties under this contract may not be delegated. If duties \nare delegated, then the other party does not have to accept performance \nfrom the delegate and can terminate the contract.”\nSubstitutions: Making a New  \nContract through Novation\nPeople sometimes forget the rule that delegation doesn’t relieve a party of \ntheir obligations, which may lead to unfortunate consequences. The solution \nto this problem is to enter into a novation  — a new contract under which the \noriginal party is discharged and another party is substituted.\n For example, a husband and wife jointly take out a car loan and agree to repay \nthe loan to the bank. Then the couple decides to separate. In their separation \nagreement (the contract that provides the terms for their separation), they \nstate that the husband will own this car and will make the payments to the \nbank. Later, the husband doesn’t pay the bank, and the bank comes after the \nwife. The wife explains that the husband is now responsible for those pay -\nments. But what really happened is that the husband and wife delegated to \nthe husband the duty to make the payments. The delegation doesn’t relieve \nthe delegating party, who remains liable for performance and breach. The wife \nhas to pay. Here, instead of delegating the duty to the husband, the couple \nshould’ve asked the bank to agree to a novation — a new contract in which \nthe bank would discharge the husband and wife from the original contract  \nand enter into a new contract with the husband.\nPart VII\nThe Part of Tens\nIn this part . . .\nT \nhis part is comprised of two chapters. The first one \nexplains how to solve contract law problems, whether \nyou’re encountering them on an exam, interviewing a  \nclient, or analyzing a contract. This chapter provides ten \nessential questions you need to ask in your contract  \nanalysis — a checklist of sorts that you can use to be sure \nyou haven’t overlooked a key issue.\nThe second chapter introduces you to ten A-listers in the \nhistory of contract law. It explains why each individual is \nimportant, describes the person’s philosophy of contract \nlaw, and highlights the significant contribution he made to \nthe evolution of contract law.",2624
105-Chapter 21 Ten Questions to Ask When Analyzing a Contracts Problem.pdf,105-Chapter 21 Ten Questions to Ask When Analyzing a Contracts Problem,"Chapter 21\nTen Questions to Ask When \nAnalyzing a Contracts Problem\nIn This Chapter\n▶ Taking the IRAC approach to resolving contract issues\n▶ Asking questions about contract formation, enforceability, and defenses\n▶ Posing questions about where to find and how to interpret contract terms\n▶ Asking about breach, remedies for breach, and third-party rights and duties\nL \naw school exams and the essay portion of the bar exam present you \nwith facts to analyze. The key word here is analyze.  Your assessors \ndon’t want to hear you advocate a position, and they aren’t very interested \nin your conclusion. They’re interested in your analysis  — your ability, given \ncertain facts, to reason from issues to possible outcomes.\n When answering an exam question or fielding such a question from a client, \nstart with the facts and then engage in the following thought process, which \nlaw school instructors refer to as IRAC (Issue, Rule, Analysis, Conclusion):\n 1. Issue: Identify the issue.\n  To identify an issue, ask lots of questions about the legal consequences \nof the facts that you’re given. When you see the issue, asking the right \nquestion should lead you to the applicable legal rule.\n 2. Rule: State the appropriate rule to resolve this issue.\n  The rule may be a black-letter rule, a principle, or a case or series of \ncases relevant to the issue.\n 3. Analysis (or Application): Perform your analysis.\n  The outcome of a legal case is a function of both facts and rules. Your \nanalysis of the problem demonstrates how well you’ve mastered the \ninterplay of facts and rules in a given situation to predict what the  \noutcome is likely to be. In the process, you may identify additional  \nsub-issues and have to loop back to the I in IRAC.\n328 Part VII: The Part of Tens \n 4. Conclusion: State the tentative solution to (the predicted outcome of) \nthe legal problem raised in the issue.\n  Don’t worry about having a firm conclusion. Raising questions is more \nimportant than answering them.\nIRAC in action\nHere’s a sample question. It’s probably too \nsimple to be representative of law school \nexams, which often have fact patterns that \nraise multiple issues. However, this example \ngives you a general idea of how to answer a \nquestion by using the IRAC approach:\nQuestion:  John Brown orally agrees to buy Mary \nSmith’s house for $300,000. Mary then goes to \nsee her lawyer, but he is not in the office, so \nshe leaves a note on his desk that says, “Just \nagreed to sell my house for $300,000 to John \nBrown. Please draw up papers. [signed] Mary \nSmith.” The next day, someone else offers Mary \n$325,000 for the house. She asks you whether \nher agreement to sell the house to John Brown \nis binding. Is it?\n 1. Identify the issue.\n  The key fact here is that the agreement \nwas oral. So you form the issue around the \nlegal significance of that fact: Is Mary’s  \nagreement to sell the house to John \nenforceable even though it’s oral?\n 2. State the rule required to resolve the issue.\n  Agreements to convey real estate are \nwithin the statute of frauds and are not \nenforceable unless evidenced by a writing.\n 3. Perform your analysis.\n  Apply the rule to the facts: This is an  \nagreement to convey real estate, so it’s within the statute of frauds. It’s not  \nenforceable unless evidenced by a writing,  \nwhich raises a sub-issue: Is there a  \nwriting that evidences this contract? The \nrule is that the writing must identify the  \nsubject matter of the contract, show that \na contract was made between the parties,  \ncontain the essential terms of the  \ntransaction, and be signed by the party \nagainst whom enforcement is sought.\n  The writing Mary left on the lawyer’s desk \nevidences the agreement. It indicates \nthat the agreement is between John and \nMary and that it is for the sale of Mary’s \nhouse, and the writing states the sales \nprice. These terms are probably sufficient, \nbecause other terms could be supplied by \ncustom and usage and the default rules. \nMary, who is the person against whom \nJohn would be enforcing the agreement, \nsigned the writing. It would not bind John if \nhe were the person who refused to perform \nthe contract.\n 4. Compose your conclusion.\n  Therefore, it appears that the agreement \nis binding on Mary because even though \nit’s oral and therefore within the statute \nof frauds, there’s a writing signed by Mary \nthat contains the essential terms of the \nagreement.",4511
106-Is a Promise Enforceable without a Contract.pdf,106-Is a Promise Enforceable without a Contract,"329  Chapter 21: Ten Questions to Ask When Analyzing a Contracts Problem\nUse the ten questions in this chapter as a checklist to ensure that you’ve \nidentified all the issues surrounding a given legal problem. This checklist is \nlike a condensed outline, so you have to flesh it out with answers to follow-up \nquestions. For example, stating “Is a contract formed?” is too broad of a  \nquestion to state as an issue on an exam. You need to narrow it down by \nasking which facts suggest that a contract may not have been formed and \nthink through subtopics of contract formation.\nThe questions and explanations for each question in this chapter can help \nyou flesh out the broad questions raised by the issues and tip you off to facts \nthat often signal a particular issue. Memorize these ten questions!\n Law school exams and the essay portion of the bar exam serve as realistic \ntraining, because you can expect to have similar experiences with clients. \nWhen a client comes to see you, relates some facts (or at least their version of \nthe facts, as you will sometimes discover to your sorrow), and asks what the \nlikely outcome will be, you don’t give an answer. You look very thoughtful and \nsay, “It depends.” What the outcome primarily depends on is the answers to \nthe issues that arise. Those issues are the questions about the legal significance \nof the facts that you need to ask in order to solve your client’s problem (or the \nproblem on the exam).\nWas a Contract Formed?\nThe first question to ask is “Was a contract formed?” Formation issues often \nask whether the offer, acceptance, and consideration necessary for a contract \nare present. If the facts are “A and B agreed that B would buy a widget from A \nfor $400,” then don’t bother looking for formation issues.\nBut if the facts don’t say that an agreement was made, look for facts that \nmake you wonder whether someone presented an offer, whether someone \naccepted, and whether consideration was present. For example, suppose the \nfacts are “A wrote to B that for the next ten days, he would sell his widget for \n$400. On the ninth day he said he changed his mind, and on the tenth day B \naccepted.” Now you have an issue: Was A’s offer still open when B accepted it?\n Like the answers on Jeopardy, your issues should always be in the form of a \nquestion. Don’t start by answering, “A’s offer was not open when B accepted \nit,” and then explain why. That’s not raising an issue — that’s defending a \nconclusion. If your analysis is wrong (for example, maybe A was a merchant \nmaking a firm offer under UCC § 2-205), you won’t get much credit. But if you \nraised the right issue and then went off the track in your analysis, you’ll still \nget some credit.",2759
107-Do the Parties Interpretations of the Contracts Language Differ.pdf,107-Do the Parties Interpretations of the Contracts Language Differ,"330 Part VII: The Part of Tens \nIs a Promise Enforceable  \nwithout a Contract?\nIf your analysis leads you to conclude that the parties don’t have a contract, \ndon’t stop there. Contract law is more generally about the enforcement of \nobligations. Look for whether the transaction includes a promise and, if it \ndoes, whether the promise is enforceable without a contract. A promise may \nbe enforceable without a contract if the doctrine of reliance or restitution \ncomes into play (see Chapter 8 for details):\n ✓ Reliance:  Look for reliance on a promise, and if you find it, analyze it \nunder Restatement § 90. Remember that the remedy in reliance may be \nlimited to the extent of the reliance. If I promise you $1,000 and you  \nreasonably rely on the promise by spending $700, you’ll probably \nrecover only $700. (If you spend $1,200, this raises the issue of whether \nspending $1,200 in reliance on a promise of $1,000 is reasonable.)\n ✓ Restitution:  If the parties have no contract but one party has conferred \na benefit on another party, ask whether the principle of restitution  \ncompels that party to give up the benefit. Sometimes an obligation to \npay for a benefit is a contract “implied in law,” which really means  \nrestitution. The remedy in restitution is generally the value of the ben -\nefit conferred, which can be difficult to measure.\nDoes a Party Have a Defense to  \nthe Contract That Was Formed?\nEven if the parties formed a contract through offer and acceptance, one of \nthe parties may be able to raise some affirmative defense that voids or avoids \nthe contract. If the defense voids  the contract, the parties didn’t form a contract, \nbut if the defense avoids  the contract, then presumably the parties had a  \ncontract initially. The affirmative defenses include illegality, unconscionability, \ncapacity, fraud, duress, undue influence, and mistake. (See Part II of this book \nfor details on contract defenses.)\n Don’t make up facts to raise issues that can lead to a contract defense. For \nexample, if the facts are “A and B entered into a contract,” don’t raise an issue \nlike “What if A was mentally incapacitated?” when no facts suggest it. On the \nother hand, if the facts say, “A and B, who was 17 years old,  entered into a  \ncontract,” raise an issue about the legal significance of that fact: “Is the con -\ntract voidable because B was a minor?”\n331  Chapter 21: Ten Questions to Ask When Analyzing a Contracts Problem\n Be on the lookout for contracts within the statute of frauds, because that \nraises the issue of whether the contract has to be evidenced by a writing. A \ntipoff is a fact like “A called B on the telephone  and ordered a widget for $600.” \nWhen you see the words “on the telephone,” a light should go on, and you \nshould raise the issue of whether this contract is enforceable if it’s oral.\nIf a defense is successful, then the court usually tries to put the parties back \nwhere they were before the agreement was made, which may require using \nprinciples of reliance and restitution. For example, if you see that a real \nestate contract is not enforceable because it’s oral, look for a fact that says \none party made a down payment to the other. The issue is then whether that \nparty can get the down payment back through restitution.\nWhere Do You Find the  \nTerms of the Contract?\nOften after the parties reduce their agreement to a signed writing, one party \nclaims that the agreement includes another term that they discussed during \nnegotiations. This issue invokes the parol evidence rule, as I explain in \nChapter 9.\n The fact that parties had a side understanding before they signed an agreement \ncan tip you off to a parol evidence rule issue. Look for facts like “ Just before \nthey signed their agreement,  A said to B, ‘Will you agree to tear down that  \nicehouse?’ and B responded, ‘I will.’ They then signed the agreement.”\nThere’s a difference between the parties’ agreement — what they in fact \nagreed to — and their contract — the sum of their legal obligations. One \nbig difference is that parties can’t possibly include language that addresses \nevery aspect of the transaction or everything that might happen in the future.\n Make sure you know which terms a court will supply under the gap-fillers or \ndefault rules. For example, if the facts say that “A agreed to sell a widget to \nB,” then you must raise issues such as whether the fact that the parties didn’t \nagree on a price is fatal to the contract and, if not, what the rule is for price in \nthe absence of an agreement. A court will also read in the parties’ course of \nperformance, course of dealing, and applicable trade usage. In a sale of goods \ntransaction, it will read in the implied warranties. And in all transactions, it \nwill read in the obligation of good faith and fair dealing. See Chapter 10 for \nmore about finding contract terms that aren’t written down.\n If you don’t know a rule, ask what’s reasonable — you won’t be far off.",5049
108-Did a Breach Occur Before Performance Was Due.pdf,108-Did a Breach Occur Before Performance Was Due,"332 Part VII: The Part of Tens \nDo the Parties’ Interpretations of  \nthe Contract’s Language Differ?\nAfter you find the terms of the contract, a dispute may arise as to the meaning \nof the words the parties used, which raises an issue of interpretation. In such \na situation, the court will determine whether the language is ambiguous. \nOne of the issues is which extrinsic evidence (evidence outside the contract) \nthe court will admit to resolve this question. The court will also use some \nrules of interpretation for guidance, so know those rules, which I explain in \nChapter 11. If the court concludes that each party had its own meaning for an \nessential term and those meanings are equally reasonable, then the issue is \nwhether the court will have to throw up its hands and say there is no  \ncontract because of a misunderstanding.\nIs a Party in Breach?\nBreach  means not doing what you promised to do. Often issues arise  \nbecause a party didn’t perform and then claims it’s not in breach because \nits performance was discharged. Discharge may arise by modification or by \naccord and satisfaction, as I explain in Chapter 12.\n To spot a modification issue, look for facts that show the parties changed \ntheir initial agreement after  it was formed. For example, the facts say, “On  \nJune 1, A agreed to sell a widget to B for $400. On June 2, B asked if A would \nreduce the price to $350, and A agreed.” Because the second agreement took \nplace after the initial agreement was made, the issue is whether the modi -\nfication is enforceable. If they instead agreed to another term before  they \nsigned the agreement, it is likely to be a parol evidence rule issue. Look to see \nwhether the agreement has a NOM (no oral modification) clause. If so, and the \nparties made an oral modification, raise an issue as to the enforceability of the  \nmodification under the waiver doctrine.\nThe claim of discharge may arise because of impracticability or frustration, \nas I explain in Chapter 13.\n To find impracticability and frustration issues, look for an event after  the  \ncontract was formed that did one of the following:\n ✓ Made performance impossible or very difficult for a seller\n ✓ Took the value out of the performance for a buyer\n333  Chapter 21: Ten Questions to Ask When Analyzing a Contracts Problem\nIf you see a fact like “Farmer A agreed to sell his crops to B. Just before \nthe harvest, a plague of locusts wiped out the crop,” the issue is probably \nwhether A’s nonperformance is excused by the occurrence of the event. If the \nparties had a belief that was not in accord with the facts before  they entered \nthe contract, it’s a mistake issue instead.\nDid a Condition Have to Occur Before  \na Performance Was Due?\nThe Restatement defines a condition  as an event that is not certain to occur \nbut that must occur before performance is due (see Chapter 14). This \ndescription helps you see the issue when the facts show that a party claims \nthat it’s not in breach because its performance was conditional.\nLook for some event that had to occur before performance was due. For \nexample, if A and B agreed that A would buy B’s house if A could get a  \nmortgage, then when A refuses to buy the house, you need to raise the issue \nof whether A’s performance was excused because the event of getting a  \nmortgage had not occurred.\n In addition to conditions that the parties expressly state, watch out for implied \nconditions  (conditions supplied by the court), including the other party’s  \nperformance in an exchange. If A promised to build a house for B for $300,000 \nand B refuses to pay, ask whether A has brought about the event that had to \noccur before B had to pay: building the house. B may claim that A didn’t do \neverything he promised, which may raise an issue of substantial performance —  \ncontract law will cut some slack and say that if the breach by one party is only \nimmaterial, then the other party still has to perform. Look for facts that raise \nan issue of substantial performance, like “A finished building a house for B \nexcept that A used Cohoes pipe for the plumbing, although the specifications \nrequired Reading pipe.”\n Don’t forget that a party’s “substantial performance” doesn’t necessarily \nexcuse their breach. The other party still has to perform but may deduct  \ndamages. For example, suppose a builder completes a house that he promised \nto build for $300,000; however, he used Cohoes pipe rather than the Reading \npipe he promised, and the owner refuses to pay. First ask whether the builder \nsubstantially performed. If the answer is yes, then you can say that the condition \noccurred that had to occur before the owner had to perform by paying for the \nhouse. But because the builder is in breach, the owner may deduct damages \nfor the breach (wrong kind of pipe) from the payment.",4906
109-How Does the Contract Affect Third Parties.pdf,109-How Does the Contract Affect Third Parties,"334 Part VII: The Part of Tens \nDid a Breach Occur Before  \nPerformance Was Due?\nBreach prior to the time of performance is called anticipatory repudiation.  \nWhether a breach occurs at the time for performance or in advance of that \ntime often doesn’t matter. Problems arise, however, when one party treats a \nbreach as material breach by anticipatory repudiation, thus discharging their \nobligations under the contract, and the other party claims it didn’t breach. \n(For more about anticipatory repudiation, see Chapter 15.)\n To find an anticipatory repudiation, look for waffling words in the facts, such \nas “A and B agreed that A would sell B his entire potato crop on August 1. On \nJuly 1, the market price was going up, and A said to B, ‘ I’m not sure you are \ngoing to get my potatoes .’” The issues here are whether what A said constitutes \nan anticipatory repudiation and what B can do to be sure.\nWhat Are the Remedies for Breach?\nIf the parties have a contract and a party breaches, then you may need to \nlook for issues involving the remedies. The general remedy is money damages, \nmeasured by the expectancy  — the amount of money required to put the  \nnon-breaching party where he would’ve been had the contract been performed \n(see Chapter 16). In computing the expectancy, you may have to deal with \nthe issues of foreseeability, certainty, and mitigation:\n ✓ Foreseeability:  Look for facts that indicate damages that don’t involve \nthe direct loss of the subject matter of the contract but that were triggered \nby the breach. For example, if the facts say, “When A didn’t get the grain \non time, he was unable to make any money from his bread factory,”  then \nyou have an issue of whether that type of loss, called consequential  \ndamages,  is recoverable.\n ✓ Certainty:  When the issue is certainty, the facts raise questions about \nwhether the party can compute her loss to a reasonable certainty. For \nexample, if the facts say, “When A didn’t publish the book, the author lost \nroyalties.”  That’s undoubtedly true, but the issue is whether the royalties \ncan be calculated to a reasonable certainty.\n ✓ Mitigation:  With mitigation, the issue is whether the non-breaching \nparty is making efforts to reduce the losses. For example, if the owner \nof the bread factory claims that she couldn’t make bread because the \ngrain was delivered late, ask what efforts she made to get the grain from \nanother seller.\n335  Chapter 21: Ten Questions to Ask When Analyzing a Contracts Problem\nThe issue of whether specific performance  (a court ordering a party to perform  \ninstead of paying money damages) is appropriate may be raised if the \nfacts suggest that the subject matter of the contract is unique. Look also at \nwhether the parties agreed to the amount of damages in a liquidated damages \nclause,  and if they did, raise the issue of whether that clause is enforceable.\nLook at your old friends reliance and restitution as remedies that the non-\nbreaching party can claim, particularly if measuring the expectancy is difficult. \nLook for losses they’ve suffered that they might not get back any other way. \nFor example, an actress agrees to appear in a Broadway musical and then \nbreaches before rehearsals begin. The producer is entitled to the money he \nwould’ve made had the show opened on Broadway. This amount is impossible \nto determine to a reasonable certainty, so he may recover in reliance the  \nout-of-pocket expenses he incurred prior to the breach.\nFinally, an issue as to whether the breaching party may be able to claim  \nrestitution might be present, particularly if the breaching party can’t recover \non the contract because she didn’t substantially perform. For example, if \na contractor promised to build a house with Reading pipe and built it with \nCohoes pipe, your analysis may lead you to the conclusion that the contractor \ndid not substantially perform. Therefore, under the contract, the owner’s \nduty to pay for the house is discharged, excusing him from paying the \nbuilder. You now have another issue: Can the builder recover in restitution \nfor the part of the house that she completed?\nHow Does the Contract  \nAffect Third Parties?\nIf the facts show that the contract involves a third party  (one who’s not a \nparty to the contract), then an issue may involve that party. Here are some \nissues relating to third parties:\n ✓ Enforcing promises: If the third party is trying to enforce a promise \nmade under the contract, then the issue is likely whether that party is a \nthird-party beneficiary (see Chapter 19).\n ✓ Warranty claims: The party may also be a third-party beneficiary if it’s \nmaking a warranty claim under the UCC when that party isn’t a party \nto the contract. For example, if the facts say, “A borrowed B’s Powerco \nelectric drill that B bought at Megamart. The drill fell apart, injuring A,” \nthen an issue exists as to whether A can make a warranty claim against \nPowerco or Megamart.\n336 Part VII: The Part of Tens \n ✓ Tortious interference: If the third party induces the breach, the issue \nis likely to be whether one of the parties to the contract has a claim \nagainst the third party for tortious interference with contract.\nIf contract rights are assigned or duties are delegated, then issues may arise \nas to whether the assignment or delegation is permissible under the default \nrules or under any language in the particular contract. If it’s not permissible, \nan additional issue may arise as to the remedy. (For more about the assignment \nof rights and delegation of duties, see Chapter 20.)",5654

It has evolved over several  \ncenturies and is a community project. This chapter shines the spotlight on \nseveral key figures, past and present, and their contributions to contract law. \nIn describing these authorities, I reference some of the legal theories associated \nwith them, including formalism, legal realism, relational contract theory, and \nlaw and economics. If you’re interested in further exploring these theories of \ncontract law, I recommend Robert Hillman’s The Richness of Contract Law  and \nPeter Linzer’s A Contracts Anthology .\nLord Mansfield\nWilliam Murray, the Earl of Mansfield (1705–1793), was the Chief Justice of \nthe King’s Bench of England during the late 18th century. He’s credited with \nmodernizing English commercial law at a time of rapid industrialization. \nMansfield revived a centuries-old tradition of having juries of merchants \ndecide commercial cases not on the basis of some abstract law imposed from \non high but on the basis of what was customary practice. This tradition  \ncontinues in the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), where an important \nsource of the parties’ agreement is usage of trade and where standards are \nfrequently found in what is “commercially reasonable.”",1594

Langdell is credited with replacing lectures \nwith the case method of instruction, so you can thank him for the fact that \nit’s hard (and rewarding!) to figure out contract law by reading cases (and \nI can thank him for the fact that the case method probably drove you to \nbuy Contract Law For Dummies ). Curiously, although his method is still in \nuse today, the reason for it has completely changed. In an age of science, \nLangdell thought that the cases were scientific data from which the principles \nof contract law could be extracted through dissection. Today, contract law \nuses the case method to compare and contrast decisions made in different \nfact situations in order to appreciate the complexity of a rule in action.\nSamuel Williston\nSamuel Williston (1861–1963) was a professor of contract law at Harvard \nand the principal Reporter for the First Restatement of Contracts (1932). \nWilliston’s monumental treatise on contract law, first published in 1920, is \nconsidered the first work that established Contracts as a field of its own. \nWilliston was a bit rigid, exemplifying a school known as legal formalism,  \nwhich relies heavily on logic and form rather than on context and substance. \nFormalists tend to see law as a closed system, separated from social policy, \nand are reluctant to explore what the law should be as opposed to what it \nsays. Williston’s treatise is being revised and updated by other scholars, so if \nyou check out Williston on Contracts,  use the 4th Edition if you want to get the \nmodern take on the subject and the older editions if you want to get a flavor \nof Williston.\nArthur Corbin\nArthur Corbin (1874–1967) was a professor of contract law at Yale Law School \nwhose monumental treatise on contract law was first published in 1950. Corbin \nhad a greater capacity than Williston for recognizing that one rule could not  \nfit all situations, and the two scholars often clashed philosophically. You  \nfrequently see their opposing views being voiced in the cases.\nCorbin was more of a legal realist, interested in context such as the agreement \nthe actual parties made, whereas Williston, as a formalist, often looked at the \ncontract more bloodlessly, as if abstract objective parties made it.

Cardozo (1870–1938) worked his way up through the New York \nstate court system, being appointed to the Court of Appeals (the highest court \nin the state) in 1914. His decisions in the area of contract law are remarkable \nfor their elegance of expression and insight into doctrine. In decisions such \nas Wood v. Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon  (1917) and Jacob & Youngs v. Kent  (1921), \nhe dragged contract law kicking and screaming into the 20th century by  \nrecognizing the significance of context over formal logic.\nAt the end of his career, Cardozo took the seat of another great thinker on \ncontracts, Oliver Wendell Holmes, on the United States Supreme Court,  \nserving from 1932 until his death.\nKarl N. Llewellyn\nKarl Llewellyn (1893–1962), a law professor at Columbia University and the \nUniversity of Chicago, was the principal author of the UCC. Llewellyn is \nassociated with the movement known as legal realism,  which saw law not as \na discrete study but as one of many social sciences, including psychology, \nsociology, and anthropology, that can be used to solve human problems. His \nstudy of the Northern Cheyenne tribe, The Cheyenne Way  (1941), is said to \nhave influenced his drafting of the UCC, which frequently relies on cultural \nnorms and shared values. Law students are sometimes forced to read his \nintroduction to law, The Bramble Bush  (1930), which has some sound ideas \nthat, like much of his work, is obscured by an inelegant writing style.\nE. Allan Farnsworth\nAllan Farnsworth (1928–2005) was a professor of law at Columbia University \nand the principal Reporter for the Second Restatement of Contracts (1981), \ntaking over that position on the death of Robert Braucher, another great \nContracts scholar. Although Farnsworth was not an innovator, he had an \nenormous talent for synthesis and clear expression. His treatise, Farnsworth \non Contracts,  now carried on by Larry Garvin, is the most comprehensive and \nreadable single-volume work on contract law.

This view finds shortcomings in looking \nat a particular contract in isolation as a transaction between two autonomous \nparties, as a legal formalist might look at it. Instead, relational theory looks \nat the contract in the context of a web of exchange relationships. Macneil’s \nbook, The New Social Contract  (1980), explains this theory.\nRichard Posner\nRichard Posner (1939–), a law professor at the University of Chicago who \nwas appointed to serve as a judge on the 7th Circuit United States Court of \nAppeals, is a leading exponent of the Law and Economics movement and \na very prolific writer on legal subjects. His book Economic Analysis of Law  \nintroduces the reader to economic principles and then shows how to use \nthem to solve problems in all areas of law, not just Contracts. He and the \n“Chicago school of economics” have many disciples today, making it a major \nforce in the field of law. His well-crafted opinions often provide great insight \ninto how economic principles can solve problems in contract law.\nStewart Macaulay\nStewart Macaulay (1931–), a professor at the University of Wisconsin School \nof Law, wrote a groundbreaking article called “Non-Contractual Relations in \nBusiness: A Preliminary Study” (1963), which showed that in practice,  \nbusinesspeople often follow their own norms based on what makes sense to \nthem rather than what contract law or their contract says.\nMacaulay’s writing is full of insights into the way things really work.
