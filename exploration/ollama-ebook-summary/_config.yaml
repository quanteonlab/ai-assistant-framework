  flashcards:
    prompt: |
      Create flashcards from the provided text following this exact format:

      1. Each flashcard must start with a level 4 header (####) describing the concept
      2. Provide background context, relevant formulas, and explanations after the header
      3. The objective is familiarity, not pure memorization - explain context and background
      4. Add C/Java code or pseudocode when relevant, explaining the logic in detail
      5. For mathematical expressions:
         - Use $$ for block math (equations on their own line)
         - Use $ for inline math (equations within text) - NO SPACES between $ and content
         - CORRECT: $f(t)$ or $E = mc^2$
         - WRONG: $ f(t) $ or $ E = mc^2 $
         - Example: The equation $$E = mc^2$$ is famous. Einstein's $E = mc^2$ relates energy and mass.
      6. Use :p to denote the question/prompt
      7. Wrap the answer between ??x and x??
      8. Separate each flashcard with ---
      9. Each flashcard should have only ONE question
      10. If multiple cards cover the same topic, specify descriptions to differentiate them

      Example format:
      #### Concept Title
      Background context explaining the concept. Include any relevant formulas or data here.
      For example, the quadratic formula is $$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$
      If applicable, add code examples with explanations.
      :p What is the question about this concept?
      ??x
      The answer with detailed explanations.
      You can use inline math like $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$ (no spaces!) or block math:
      $$
      \int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
      $$
      Include code examples if relevant:
      ```java
      public class Example {
          // code here
      }
      ```
      x??

  flashcard_rating:
    prompt: |
      Rate the following flashcard on a scale of 1-10 based on how technically useful and important it is for long-term retention as an engineer or technical professional.

      When evaluating relevancy, prioritize the focus area specified for this book (if provided above).
      For example:
      - If the focus is "programming techniques", prioritize practical coding patterns and best practices
      - If the focus is "mathematical concepts", prioritize theorems, proofs, and problem-solving methods
      - If the focus is "system design patterns", prioritize architecture and scalability concepts

      Consider:
      - Technical depth and accuracy
      - Practical applicability in real-world engineering
      - Relevance to the book's focus area (if specified above)
      - Fundamental concepts vs trivial facts
      - Long-term value for career development
      - Core concepts that build foundational knowledge

      Rating scale:
      10: Critical foundational concept every engineer must know, highly relevant to focus area
      8-9: Highly valuable technical knowledge with broad applicability to the focus area
      6-7: Useful technical information worth remembering, reasonably relevant
      4-5: Moderately useful, somewhat niche or context-specific
      2-3: Low technical value, trivial or overly specific
      1: Not useful for technical professionals, or completely irrelevant to focus area

      Respond with ONLY a single number from 1-10, nothing else.

  chinese_flashcards:
    prompt: |
      Create Chinese language flashcards from the provided text. Generate TWO types of flashcards:

      IMPORTANT: For mathematical expressions, use $$ for block math and $ for inline math.
      Inline math must have NO SPACES: $f(t)$ is CORRECT, $ f(t) $ is WRONG.
      Example: $$E = mc^2$$ or inline $E = mc^2$

      TYPE 1: ADVANCED TERMINOLOGY FLASHCARDS
      These focus on advanced/specialized Chinese vocabulary. Format:
      #### [Topic/Context]
      [Brief background explaining the term usage and context]
      :p [Chinese characters]:::[Pinyin], [English translation]
      ??x
      [Detailed explanation of usage, context, example sentences in both Chinese and English]
      x??

      Example:
      #### Transportation Terminology
      This term is commonly used in formal contexts when discussing vehicle operation.
      :p 行驶的时间:::Xíngshǐ de shíjiān, Travel time / Duration of travel
      ??x
      Used to refer to the time taken for a vehicle to travel. Example:
      - 从北京到上海的行驶的时间大约需要五小时。(Cóng Běijīng dào Shànghǎi de xíngshǐ de shíjiān dàyuē xūyào wǔ xiǎoshí.)
      - The travel time from Beijing to Shanghai takes approximately five hours.
      x??

      TYPE 2: COMPREHENSION FLASHCARDS
      These test understanding of concepts with bilingual content. Format:
      #### [Concept Title in English and Chinese]

      :p [Question in English with Chinese translation]
      ??x
      [Answer in both English and Chinese with detailed explanations]

      #### 中国历史朝代 / Chinese Historical Dynasties
      中国有许多朝代，每个朝代都有其独特的文化和贡献。
      China has many dynasties, each with unique culture and contributions.
      :p What were the major achievements of the Tang Dynasty? / 唐朝的主要成就是什么？
