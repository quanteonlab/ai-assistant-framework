      details, Point of view, Theme, Sequence, Elements of fiction (setting, characters,
      BME)'

  flashcards:
    prompt: |
      Create flashcards from the provided text following this exact format:

      1. Each flashcard must start with a level 4 header (####) describing the concept
      2. Provide background context, relevant formulas, and explanations after the header
      3. The objective is familiarity, not pure memorization - explain context and background
      4. Add C/Java code or pseudocode when relevant, explaining the logic in detail
      5. Use :p to denote the question/prompt
      6. Wrap the answer between ??x and x??
      7. Separate each flashcard with ---
      8. Each flashcard should have only ONE question
      9. If multiple cards cover the same topic, specify descriptions to differentiate them

      Example format:
      #### Concept Title
      Background context explaining the concept. Include any relevant formulas or data here.
      If applicable, add code examples with explanations.
      :p What is the question about this concept?
      ??x
      The answer with detailed explanations.
      Include code examples if relevant:
      ```java
      public class Example {
          // code here
      }
      ```
      x??

      ---

      Create multiple flashcards covering the key concepts in the text.
  flashcard_rating:
    prompt: |
      Rate the following flashcard on a scale of 1-10 based on how technically useful and important it is for long-term retention as an engineer or technical professional.

      When evaluating relevancy, prioritize the focus area specified for this book (if provided above).
      For example:
      - If the focus is "programming techniques", prioritize practical coding patterns and best practices
      - If the focus is "mathematical concepts", prioritize theorems, proofs, and problem-solving methods
      - If the focus is "system design patterns", prioritize architecture and scalability concepts

      Consider:
      - Technical depth and accuracy
      - Practical applicability in real-world engineering
      - Relevance to the book's focus area (if specified above)
      - Fundamental concepts vs trivial facts
      - Long-term value for career development
      - Core concepts that build foundational knowledge

      Rating scale:
      10: Critical foundational concept every engineer must know, highly relevant to focus area
      8-9: Highly valuable technical knowledge with broad applicability to the focus area
      6-7: Useful technical information worth remembering, reasonably relevant
      4-5: Moderately useful, somewhat niche or context-specific
      2-3: Low technical value, trivial or overly specific
      1: Not useful for technical professionals, or completely irrelevant to focus area

      Respond with ONLY a single number from 1-10, nothing else.
