#### Interdiffusion and Impurity Diffusion
Background context: Interdiffusion refers to the diffusion of atoms between two different materials, while impurity diffusion involves the movement of atoms in a host material.

Interdiffusion is the process by which atoms of one metal diffuse into another, creating an alloyed region. This can be observed macroscopically through changes in concentration over time. Impurity diffusion refers to the movement of atoms in a host material that are not part of its normal composition.

Heating a Cu-Ni diffusion couple at an elevated temperature (below the melting point) for an extended period allows atoms to diffuse, creating a condition where pure copper and nickel are found at the extremities. A mixed alloyed region forms between them with concentrations of both metals varying with position.

This result demonstrates that copper atoms have migrated into the nickel, and vice versa.

:p What is interstitial diffusion?
??x
Interstitial diffusion involves atoms moving from interstitial positions to adjacent empty lattice sites. This process is common for impurities such as hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen because their smaller atomic sizes allow them to fit into these positions more easily.

The negative sign indicates that diffusion occurs down the concentration gradient, from a high to a low concentration.

#### Steady-State Diffusion
Background context: In steady-state diffusion, the flux does not change with time. This means that the mass of diffusing species entering one side of a barrier equals the mass exiting the other side. An example is the diffusion of atoms of a gas through a thin metal plate where the concentrations on both surfaces are held constant.

:p What characterizes steady-state diffusion?
??x
In steady-state diffusion, the flux does not change with time. This implies that there is no net accumulation of diffusing species in the medium; the mass entering one side equals the mass exiting the other side.
