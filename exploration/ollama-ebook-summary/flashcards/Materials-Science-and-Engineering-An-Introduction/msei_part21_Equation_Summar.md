#### Critical Resolved Shear Stress (τcrss)
Critical resolved shear stress is a crucial parameter in understanding dislocation movement and strengthening mechanisms. It represents the minimum resolved shear stress required for dislocations to move within a crystal under applied stress.

Background context:
In metals, dislocation motion plays a significant role in plastic deformation and strengthening. The resolved shear stress (τR) experienced by dislocations along their slip systems is crucial for their motion. For a single crystal stressed in tension with an angle λ between the tensile axis and the slip direction, and an angle φ between the tensile axis and the normal to the slip plane, the resolved shear stress τR can be calculated using Equation 7.2:
$$\tau_R = \sigma \cos\phi \cos\lambda$$

The critical resolved shear stress (τcrss) is defined as the maximum value of this resolved shear stress that allows dislocations to move. This value is essential because it determines whether plastic deformation will occur.

:p What is the formula for calculating the critical resolved shear stress?
??x
The formula for the critical resolved shear stress, τcrss, is derived from the resolved shear stress (τR) equation:
$$\tau_{\text{crss}} = \sigma_y (\cos\phi \cos\lambda)_{\max}$$where $\sigma_y$ is the yield strength of the material. This value represents the minimum stress required for dislocation motion to occur.

#### Grain Growth and Average Grain Size
Grain growth is an essential process in materials science, particularly after heat treatment or during long-term use under elevated temperatures. The average grain size (d) can be determined using Equation 7.7:
$$d = d_0 + K t^{n}$$

Background context:
When a metal undergoes grain growth, the average grain size increases over time due to the tendency of smaller grains to grow at the expense of larger ones. The initial average grain size (d0) serves as the starting point for this process.

The equation includes material constants K and n, where K depends on the diffusion rate within the metal and n is the grain size exponent, which can have a value close to 2 in many materials.

:p What is the formula used to calculate the average grain size during grain growth?
??x
The formula for calculating the average grain size (d) during grain growth is given by:
$$d = d_0 + K t^{n}$$where $ d_0$ is the initial average grain size, K is a material constant dependent on diffusion rates, t is the time over which grain growth occurs, and n is the grain size exponent.

#### Hall-Petch Equation for Yield Strength
The Hall-Petch equation describes how the yield strength of metals increases with decreasing average grain size. This relationship helps in understanding how finer grains can enhance the mechanical properties of materials.

Background context:
The Hall-Petch equation relates the yield strength (σy) to the average grain size (d):
$$\sigma_y = \sigma_0 + k_y d^{-1/2}$$where $\sigma_0 $ is a material constant representing the residual stress, and$k_y$ is another material constant related to the dislocation density.

:p What equation describes the relationship between yield strength and grain size?
??x
The Hall-Petch equation describes the relationship between yield strength (σy) and average grain size (d):
$$\sigma_y = \sigma_0 + k_y d^{-1/2}$$where $\sigma_0 $ is a material constant representing the residual stress, and$k_y$ is another material constant related to the dislocation density.

#### Percent Cold Work
Percent cold work quantifies the extent of deformation in materials subjected to plastic deformation without prior recrystallization. This measure is useful for understanding processing history and predicting mechanical properties.

Background context:
Cold working refers to the process of deforming a material at temperatures below its recrystallization temperature, typically room temperature or lower. The percent cold work (percentCW) can be calculated using Equation 7.8:
$$\text{percentCW} = \left( \frac{A_0 - A_d}{A_0} \right) \times 100$$where $ A_0 $ is the initial cross-sectional area of the specimen, and $ A_d$ is its cross-sectional area after deformation.

:p How is percent cold work calculated?
??x
The formula for calculating percent cold work (percentCW) is:
$$\text{percentCW} = \left( \frac{A_0 - A_d}{A_0} \right) \times 100$$where $ A_0 $ is the initial cross-sectional area of the specimen, and $ A_d$ is its cross-sectional area after deformation.

#### Dislocation Density
Dislocation density is a crucial factor in understanding plastic deformation mechanisms. It represents the number of dislocations per unit volume within a crystal.

Background context:
In materials science, the presence of dislocations significantly influences mechanical properties such as yield strength and ductility. The critical resolved shear stress (τcrss) depends on the dislocation density (D), which can be related to the grain size using the Hall-Petch equation.

:p What is the term used to describe the number of dislocations per unit volume?
??x
The term used to describe the number of dislocations per unit volume is called dislocation density (D).

#### Failure in Structures
Failure modes in structures, such as the failure of an oil tanker and a commercial aircraft, illustrate how small flaws can lead to catastrophic outcomes under applied stress. This phenomenon is related to fracture mechanics.

Background context:
- **Oil Tanker Failure**: The failure was due to the propagation of a crack around the girth of the tanker starting from a small notch.
- **Aircraft Failure**: The failure occurred due to metal fatigue aggravated by crevice corrosion, resulting in explosive decompression and structural failure during operation in a humid and salty coastal environment.

:p What are some examples of structures that have failed due to specific failure modes?
??x
Examples of structures that have failed due to specific failure modes include:
- An oil tanker that fractured due to the propagation of a crack starting from a small notch.
- A Boeing 737-200 commercial aircraft that experienced explosive decompression and structural failure due to metal fatigue aggravated by crevice corrosion.
