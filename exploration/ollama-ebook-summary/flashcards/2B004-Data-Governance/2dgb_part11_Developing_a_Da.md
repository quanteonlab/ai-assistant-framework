#### Natural Experiment Definition
A natural experiment is a situation where participants are naturally divided into experimental and control groups based on factors outside the control of the investigators. This method is used when random assignment to conditions is not feasible or ethical, such as in observational studies.

In our example, runners fell into different shoe groups based on their preferences rather than being randomly assigned by researchers. The large number of participants ensured good quality experimental and control groups while controlling for external factors.

:p What is a natural experiment?
??x
A natural experiment occurs when participants are divided into experimental and control groups based on naturally occurring factors, not controlled by the investigators.

#### Data Compilation and Analysis in Natural Experiment
The New York Times compiled vast datasets of marathon and half-marathon results to analyze the impact of different running shoes. They compared performance across similar conditions (same races) with varying shoe types or athletes participating in multiple races on different dates.

:p How did The New York Times ensure consistency in their natural experiment?
??x
To ensure consistency, The New York Times included factors such as weather and course difficulty. They also excluded outliers from less-frequented races or extreme conditions. By doing so, they aimed to maintain high-quality records suitable for comparison.

#### Nike Study Consistency with Natural Experiment
The conclusion that Nike shoes were associated with better performance was consistent with their funded study but derived naturally from the data collected by The New York Times.

:p How did The New York Times conclude about the effectiveness of Nike shoes?
??x
The New York Times analyzed 280,000 marathon and 215,000 half-marathon results, comparing performance across different shoe types under similar conditions. Their findings suggested that runners often performed better when wearing Nike shoes.

#### Importance of Data Governance Policy
A data governance policy is a documented set of guidelines for managing an organization's data assets consistently and ensuring their proper use. It includes policies on data quality, access, security, privacy, and usage.

:p What is the purpose of a data governance policy?
??x
The purpose of a data governance policy is to ensure consistent, efficient, and effective management of data across an organization’s life cycle. It also ensures appropriate protection based on the value and risk of different categories of data.

#### NASA Incident and Data Governance Lessons
In 1999, NASA's Mars Climate Orbiter mission failed due to a unit conversion error between metric and imperial systems used by two partners. To avoid similar issues, they implemented strict checks and balances.

:p What caused the failure of the Mars Climate Orbiter?
??x
The Mars Climate Orbiter mission failed due to a mismatch in units (metric vs. imperial) between NASA and its partner, leading to incorrect calculations for spacecraft operations.

- Policy scope
- Definitions and terms
- Policy principles
- Program structure
- Policy review
- Further assistance

:p What does the policy scope cover in a data governance program?
??x
The policy scope covers:
- Specific data assets that are governed by the policy.
- Inventory of data sources.
- Data classifications (sensitive, confidential, publicly available) along with required levels of security and protection.
x??

#### Policy Principles and Standards
Background context: The principles define rules and standards for the governance program, including procedures to enforce them. These cover aspects like data access, usage, integration, and integrity.

:p What are some examples of policy principles that might be included in a data governance policy?
??x
Examples of policy principles include:
- Data access: Who has access to what data.
- Data usage: How the data will be used and what is acceptable.
- Data integration: Transformations the data will undergo.
- Data integrity: Expectations around data quality.
