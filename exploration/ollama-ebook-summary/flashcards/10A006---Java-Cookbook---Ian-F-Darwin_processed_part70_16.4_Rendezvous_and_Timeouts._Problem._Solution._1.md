#### Rendezvous and Timeouts Concept
Background context explaining how join() method works to synchronize threads. The `join()` method allows one thread to wait for another thread to finish its execution before proceeding. This is useful when you need to ensure that a certain task is completed or timed out.
:p What does the `join()` method do in Java?
??x
The `join()` method waits until the target thread completes its execution. It can be called with no arguments, which means it will wait indefinitely for the thread to terminate, or with a timeout value, allowing the main thread to proceed after a specified amount of time if the target thread hasn't finished.
```java
public class Join {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t = new Thread() {
            public void run() {
                System.out.println("Reading" );
                try {
                    System.in.read();
                } catch (java.io.IOException  ex) {
                    System.err.println(ex);
                }
                System.out.println("Thread Finished." );
            }
        };
        System.out.println("Starting" );
        t.start(); // Start the thread
        try {
            t.join(); // Wait for the thread to finish
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
    }
}
```

#### Usage of `join()` with No Arguments
Background context explaining how using `join()` without arguments makes the main thread wait indefinitely until the target thread finishes its execution.
:p How does a call to `t.join()` work when no timeout value is provided?
??x
When `t.join()` is called without any arguments, it causes the current thread (main thread in this case) to wait indefinitely until the thread `t` has finished executing. This means the main thread will halt execution and not proceed further until `t` completes its `run()` method.
```java
public class Join {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t = new Thread() {
            public void run() {
                System.out.println("Reading" );
                try {
                    System.in.read();
                } catch (java.io.IOException  ex) {
                    System.err.println(ex);
                }
                System.out.println("Thread Finished." );
            }
        };
        System.out.println("Starting" );
        t.start(); // Start the thread
        t.join(); // Wait indefinitely for the thread to finish
    }
}
```
x??
---

#### Usage of `join()` with a Timeout Argument
Background context explaining how using `join()` with a timeout value allows the main thread to proceed after a specified amount of time, even if the target thread hasn't finished.
:p How does a call to `t.join(timeout)` work in Java?
??x
When `t.join(long timeout)` is called, it causes the current thread (main thread) to wait for up to `timeout` milliseconds. If the thread finishes within this time, the method returns normally; otherwise, it returns immediately and may throw an `InterruptedException`. This is useful when you want to avoid blocking indefinitely.
```java
public class Join {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Thread t = new Thread() {
            public void run() {
                System.out.println("Reading" );
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(5000); // Simulate a long running task
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                }
                System.out.println("Thread Finished." );
            }
        };
        System.out.println("Starting" );
        t.start(); // Start the thread
        if (!t.join(2000)) { // Wait for up to 2 seconds, then proceed
            System.out.println("Timed out before completion.");
        }
    }
}
```

#### Synchronized Keyword Usage
Background context: The `synchronized` keyword is used to control access to shared resources in a multi-threaded environment. It ensures that only one thread can execute the synchronized method or block of code at any given time, thus preventing race conditions and data corruption.

If applicable, add code examples with explanations:
```java
class SafeCounter {
    private int count = 0;

    // Synchronized method to ensure thread-safe increment operation
    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        SafeCounter counter = new SafeCounter();
        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> { for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) counter.increment(); });
        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> { for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) counter.increment(); });

        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        // Wait until both threads finish
        t1.join();
        t2.join();

        System.out.println("Count: " + counter.count);
    }
}
```
:p What is the purpose of using the `synchronized` keyword in this example?
??x
The `synchronized` keyword ensures that only one thread can execute the `increment` method at a time, preventing race conditions and ensuring the final count is accurate.
x??

---

#### Thread Synchronization Example with Array Appending
Background context: In multi-threaded environments, it's crucial to ensure data integrity by synchronizing access to shared resources. If multiple threads attempt to modify an array simultaneously without proper synchronization, race conditions can occur.

:p What issue arises when two threads try to append elements to a simple array concurrently?
??x
When two threads try to append elements to a simple array concurrently, one thread may overwrite the element being appended by another thread before it is fully stored. This leads to data corruption and potential runtime errors.
x??

---

#### Synchronized Block Example
Background context: The `synchronized` keyword can also be applied to blocks of code within methods. Using synchronized blocks provides more granular control over which parts of a method should be protected.

:p How can you use the `synchronized` keyword with a block of code?
??x
You can use the `synchronized` keyword with a block of code by specifying an object as the lock. This ensures that only one thread at a time executes the block, even if it spans multiple lines.
```java
class SafeVector {
    private Object[] data = new Object[10];
    private int max = 0;

    // Synchronized block to ensure thread-safe addition
    public void add(Object obj) {
        synchronized (this) { // 'this' refers to the current object instance
            if (max < data.length) {
                data[max] = obj;
                max++;
            } else {
                System.out.println("Vector is full");
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        SafeVector vector = new SafeVector();
        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> { for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) vector.add(i); });
        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> { for (int i = 5; i < 10; i++) vector.add(i); });

        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        // Wait until both threads finish
        t1.join();
        t2.join();

        System.out.println("Vector: " + java.util.Arrays.toString(vector.data));
    }
}
```
x??

#### Synchronized vs. Combined Code Example
Background context: Combining operations in a synchronized block can prevent race conditions, but it's essential to understand that `synchronized` works at the method or block level and not just between statements.

:p Why combining two lines of code does not guarantee thread safety?
??x
Combining the two lines of code into one does not guarantee thread safety because an interrupt could still occur between the store operation (writing data[max] = obj) and the increment operation (max++). The `synchronized` keyword ensures that these operations are atomic with respect to other threads.
```java
public void add(Object obj) {
    // Incorrect approach - can lead to race conditions
    max++;
    data[max] = obj;
}
```
x??

---

#### Thread Interruption Handling in Synchronized Context
Background context: Even when using `synchronized` blocks, threads can still be interrupted by external forces. Proper handling of interruptions is crucial for robust multi-threaded applications.

:p How should you handle interruptions in a synchronized method?
??x
You should use the `InterruptedException` to properly handle interruptions within a synchronized block or method. This allows your application to gracefully respond to interruptions and manage thread lifecycle appropriately.
```java
class InterruptSafeThread implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        try {
            // Simulate long-running task that can be interrupted
            for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
                Thread.sleep(100);
                if (Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) {
                    System.out.println("Interrupted!");
                    break;
                }
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            // Handle interruption
            System.out.println("Handling interrupted state");
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Thread t = new Thread(new InterruptSafeThread());
        t.start();
        // Intentionally interrupt the thread after some time
        Thread.sleep(200);
        t.interrupt();
    }
}
```

#### Synchronized Methods and Blocks Overview
Background context explaining synchronized methods and blocks. This is an essential concept for ensuring thread safety in Java, where multiple threads can interact with shared resources without causing data corruption or inconsistent states.

:Synchronized methods and blocks allow controlling access to shared resources so that only one thread can execute the code at a time. Synchronizing entire methods ensures that no other method can run while it is executing, whereas synchronizing blocks allows finer-grained control over which sections of code are protected from concurrent execution by other threads.
??x
Synchronized methods and blocks help prevent race conditions and ensure that critical sections of code are executed atomically. By using synchronization, you can guarantee thread safety without blocking the entire method or unnecessary parts of it.

```java
// Example: Synchronized Method
public synchronized void add(Object obj) {
    // Code to be executed by one thread at a time
}

// Example: Synchronized Block
public void add(Object obj) {
    synchronized (someObject) {
        // Code to be executed in one thread at a time, using someObject as the monitor
    }
}
```

#### Servlet Synchronization with `synchronized` Keyword
Background context explaining how the `synchronized` keyword is used within servlets. This example demonstrates synchronizing access to shared resources like application attributes.

:p How does the `BuzzInServlet` use synchronization?
??x
The `BuzzInServlet` uses a synchronized block around the code that updates and checks the state of the "buzzed" Boolean variable, ensuring that only one contestant can change this state at a time. This prevents two contestants from winning simultaneously by pressing their buzzer.

```java
public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
        throws ServletException, IOException {
    ServletContext application = getServletContext();
    boolean iWon = false;
    String user = request.getRemoteHost() + '@' + request.getRemoteAddr();

    // Synchronized stuff first and in one place.
    synchronized (application) { 
        if (application.getAttribute(WINNER) == null) {
            application.setAttribute(WINNER, user);
            application.log("BuzzInServlet: WINNER " + user);
            iWon = true;
        }
    }

    response.setContentType("text/html");
    PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
    out.println("<html><head><title>Thanks for playing</title></head>");
    out.println("<body bgcolor=\"white\">");

    if (iWon) {
        out.println("<b>YOU GOT IT</b>");
        // TODO - output HTML to play a sound file :-
    } else {
        out.println("Thanks for playing, " + request.getRemoteAddr());
        out.println(", but " + application.getAttribute(WINNER) + " buzzed in first");
    }

    out.println("</body></html>");
}
```

#### Synchronization with `ArrayList`
Background context explaining how to synchronize access to a shared resource like an `ArrayList`. This example demonstrates using the `ArrayList` instance as the monitor.

:p How should you synchronize access to an `ArrayList` in Java?
??x
To ensure thread safety when accessing or modifying an `ArrayList`, you can use synchronization on the `ArrayList` instance itself. Here, the code checks if the `ArrayList` contains a specific object and performs actions accordingly within a synchronized block.

```java
synchronized (myArrayList) {
    if (myArrayList.indexOf(someObject) == -1) {
        // Do something with it.
    } else {
        create an object and add it...
    }
}
```

This ensures that only one thread can access or modify the `ArrayList` at a time, preventing race conditions.

```java
// Example of using synchronized block on ArrayList
public void updateList(Object obj) {
    synchronized (myArrayList) {
        if (!myArrayList.contains(obj)) {
            myArrayList.add(obj);
        } else {
            // Handle existing object
        }
    }
}
```

#### Servlet Methods and Roles

Background context: The provided text describes a servlet, `BuzzInServlet`, that handles both GET and POST requests. It distinguishes between different user roles (contestant vs. host) and performs specific actions based on the command received.

:p What are the two main methods used in this servlet to handle different types of HTTP requests?
??x
The `doGet()` method is responsible for handling GET requests, while the `doPost()` method handles POST requests.
x??

---

#### Handling GET Requests

Background context: The `doGet()` method processes a simple HTML link from the contestant's page that leads to this servlet. It does not require any special actions since contestants can only press a button to buzz in.

:p What is the role of the `doGet()` method in handling requests from contestants?
??x
The `doGet()` method handles GET requests sent by contestants, allowing them to buzz in by pressing a link on their HTML page.
x??

---

#### Handling POST Requests

Background context: The `doPost()` method processes commands from the host. It can either reset the buzzer or display the winner based on the command received.

:p What does the `doPost()` method do when it receives a "reset" command?
??x
When the `doPost()` method receives a "reset" command, it resets the buzzer for the next question by setting the `WINNER` attribute in the application scope to null. It also sets a message indicating that the buzzer has been reset.
```java
synchronized (application) {
    application.setAttribute(WINNER, null);
}
session.setAttribute("buzzin.message", "RESET");
```
x??

---

#### Displaying the Winner

Background context: The `doPost()` method can display the current winner if a "show" command is received. It retrieves the winner from the application scope and sets an appropriate message for the host.

:p What does the `doPost()` method do when it receives a "show" command?
??x
When the `doPost()` method receives a "show" command, it checks the `WINNER` attribute in the application scope. If there is no winner yet, it sets a message indicating so; otherwise, it sets a message showing the name of the current winner.
```java
String winner = null;
synchronized (application) {
    winner = (String)application.getAttribute(WINNER);
}
if (winner == null) {
    session.setAttribute("buzzin.message", "<b>No winner yet.</b>");
} else {
    session.setAttribute("buzzin.message", "<b>Winner is: </b>" + winner);
}
```
x??

---

#### Error Handling

Background context: The `doPost()` method includes error handling for invalid commands. It sets an appropriate message if the command received is not recognized.

:p How does the `doPost()` method handle invalid commands?
??x
The `doPost()` method checks if the received command is valid. If it's not, it sets a message indicating that the command is invalid.
```java
else {
    session.setAttribute("buzzin.message", "ERROR: Command " + command + " invalid.");
}
```
x??

---

#### Synchronized Code Blocks

Background context: The `doPost()` method uses synchronized code blocks to ensure thread safety when accessing and modifying shared resources, such as the application scope.

:p Why are synchronized blocks used in this servlet?
??x
Synchronized blocks are used to ensure that only one thread can access or modify a specific resource at any given time. In this case, the `doPost()` method uses synchronized blocks around operations that change the `WINNER` attribute in the application scope.
```java
synchronized (application) {
    // code here
}
```
x??

#### Overview of Threaded Java Concepts
This section covers various synchronization techniques and their implementation in Java. It introduces the use of `Lock` mechanisms from the `java.util.concurrent.locks` package to manage thread access more efficiently than traditional synchronized blocks.

:p What are some key features of the Lock mechanism introduced in this section?
??x
The `Lock` mechanism provides a flexible way to synchronize threads, allowing for more control over locking and unlocking processes compared to the traditional `synchronized` keyword. Key methods include:

- `lock()`: Acquires the lock.
- `tryLock()`: Tries to acquire the lock if free immediately.
- `tryLock(long time, TimeUnit units)`: Tries to acquire the lock with a timeout.
- `unlock()`: Releases the acquired lock.

:p How does using `Lock` improve upon traditional synchronized methods?
??x
Using `Lock` improves flexibility and control over thread synchronization. It allows for try-locking (where you can check if a lock is available before waiting) and interruptible locking, which are not possible with traditional synchronized blocks. This makes it easier to implement complex concurrency scenarios.

:p What is the general pattern for using Locks in Java?
??x
The typical usage pattern involves acquiring the lock before performing critical sections of code and ensuring that the lock is released afterward:

```java
Lock lock = ...;
try {
    lock.lock();
    // Perform actions protected by the lock.
} finally {
    lock.unlock();
}
```
This ensures that the unlock operation will always be executed, even if an exception occurs. This pattern supports more complex concurrency patterns compared to traditional synchronized blocks.

:p How does a `ReadWriteLock` differ from a standard `Lock`?
??x
A `ReadWriteLock` is specifically designed for scenarios where multiple readers can access data simultaneously while ensuring exclusive write access. It consists of two separate locks: one for reading and another for writing:

- The read lock allows any number of threads to hold it concurrently.
- The write lock blocks all other operations, including other reader locks.

:p How does the `ReentrantReadWriteLock` implementation work?
??x
The `ReentrantReadWriteLock` class provides both a read lock and a write lock. It supports reentrancy for readers but not writers. Here is an example of using it:

```java
ReadWriteLock rwlock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
// Locking the read lock.
rwlock.readLock().lock();
try {
    // Perform read operations here.
} finally {
    rwlock.readLock().unlock();
}
```

:p Can you give a real-world application scenario for `ReadWriteLock`?
??x
A typical use case is in web-based voting applications where:
- Multiple readers (users) can view the current vote counts without modifying them.
- Writers (administrators) can update the vote counts.

The `BallotBox` class in the provided example demonstrates this pattern, using a `ReadWriteLock` to manage access between reading and writing threads efficiently.

:p How does the `ReadersWritersDemo` class implement concurrent voting?
??x
In the `ReadersWritersDemo` class, multiple reader threads are created to simulate voters who read the current vote counts. A single writer thread simulates an administrator who updates the votes:

```java
// Start two reader threads.
for (int i = 0; i < NUM_READER_THREADS; i++) {
    new Thread(() -> {
        while (!done) {
            rwlock.readLock().lock();
            try {
                theData.forEach(p -> 
                    System.out.printf("votes: %d%%\n", p.getPercent()));
            } finally {
                // Unlock in "finally" to ensure it gets done.
                rwlock.readLock().unlock();
            }
            try {
                Thread.sleep((long)(Math.random() * 1000));
            } catch (InterruptedException ex) {
                // Nothing to do
            }
        }
    }).start();
}

// Start one writer thread.
new Thread(() -> {
    while (!done) {
        rwlock.writeLock().lock();
        try {
            theData.voteFor(((int)(Math.random() * theData.getCandidateCount())));
        } finally {
            rwlock.writeLock().unlock();
        }
    }
}).start();
```
This implementation ensures that readers can access the data concurrently, while writers are blocked until all readers have finished their operations.
