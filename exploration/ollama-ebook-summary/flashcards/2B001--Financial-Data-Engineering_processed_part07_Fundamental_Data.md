#### Fundamental Data Overview
Background context explaining fundamental data, including its sources and importance. Fundamental data encompasses financial statements like balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements, which provide insights into a firm's structure, operations, and performance.

:p What are the main types of financial statements that convey information about firms?
??x
The main types of financial statements include:
- **Balance Sheet**: Provides figures on assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity.
- **Income Statement**: Shows financial performance over a specific period, such as revenues and net profit.
- **Cash Flow Statement**: Offers details on cash movements.

These statements are crucial for understanding the firm's financial health and operations. For example, ROE (Return on Equity) is calculated by dividing net income by shareholders' equity: \( \text{ROE} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Shareholders' Equity}} \).

#### Characteristics of Fundamental Data
Explanation of the characteristics of fundamental data, such as low frequency and delayed reporting.

:p What are some key characteristics of fundamental data?
??x
Key characteristics include:
- **Low Frequency**: Financial statements are released infrequently, typically quarterly or annually.
- **Delayed Reporting**: Data for a specific period is often published with a time lapse, meaning it’s not available immediately after the event.
- **Revisions and Corrections**: Figures can be revised and corrected after initial release (reinstatements), and data backfilling can occur.

These characteristics affect how data is handled, particularly in terms of PIT (Point-in-Time) versus non-PIT datasets.

#### PIT vs Non-PIT Data
Explanation of the differences between Point-in-Time (PIT) and non-PIT data, including their implications for historical studies.

:p What are the main differences between PIT and non-PIT data?
??x
- **PIT Data** records data with timestamps reflecting the filing or release date. It allows asking questions like "When was the data released?" and "What data was known at that time?"
- **Non-PIT Data** is stamped with the fiscal year-end date or the latest update date, representing the most recent version of the data.

Table 2-7 illustrates:
| Data type | Preliminary result | Fiscal year-end release | Correction | Version 101 | 110 | 120 |
|-----------|--------------------|------------------------|------------|-------------|-----|-----|
| PIT       | 101                | 110                    | 120        | 101         | 110 | 120 |
| Non-PIT   | 120                | 120                    | 120        | 120         | 120 | 120 |

PIT data keeps all historical snapshots, while non-PIT only shows the latest version.

#### Financial Highlights from a Bank Annual Report
Explanation of how to read and interpret financial highlights in an annual report.

:p What are some key items in ADK's annual financial highlights?
??x
Key items include:
- **Total Net Revenues**: $102 billion in 2020 (versus $99 billion in 2021).
- **Net Income**: $23 billion in 2020 (versus $25 billion in 2019).
- **Return on Common Equity**: 11% in 2020 (versus 16% in 2019).
- **Total Assets**: Over $3 trillion.
- **Headcount**: 150,432 employees.

These metrics provide insights into the bank's financial health and stability. For example, the Tier 1 capital ratio of 15% indicates strong financial stability according to Basel III standards (minimum 6%).

#### Total Net Revenue and Financial Performance
Background context explaining total net revenue, its calculation, and its significance for financial performance. This includes understanding how it is derived from revenues after deducting certain costs but before dividends are paid.
:p What is the definition of total net revenue?
??x
Total net revenue represents the total income generated by a company from its core operations before deducting expenses and other costs. It is calculated as:
\[ \text{Net Revenue} = \text{Total Sales} - \text{Costs of Goods Sold (COGS)} - \text{Operating Expenses} + \text{Other Income} \]
For the provided data, it shows a consistent revenue growth year over year.

#### Total Noninterest Expense
Background context explaining total noninterest expenses, their components, and how they impact net income. Highlight that these are operational costs not related to interest payments on borrowed funds.
:p What are non-interest expenses?
??x
Non-interest expenses refer to the operating costs of a business that do not directly relate to the cost of borrowing money (interest). These include items such as salaries, rent, utilities, and administrative costs. They significantly impact net income by reducing revenue after expenses have been accounted for.
Example:
```java
public class FinancialData {
    public int calculateNetIncome(int totalRevenue, int nonInterestExpenses) {
        return totalRevenue - nonInterestExpenses;
    }
}
```

#### Cash Dividends per Share and Return on Common Equity
Background context explaining the calculation of cash dividends per share and its relationship to net income. Also explain how it contributes to the return on common equity.
:p How is the cash dividend per share calculated?
??x
Cash dividends per share are calculated by dividing the total cash dividends paid in a period by the number of outstanding shares. The formula for this calculation is:
\[ \text{Dividend Per Share} = \frac{\text{Total Cash Dividends}}{\text{Number of Outstanding Shares}} \]
For example, if a company pays $23,100 million in dividends and has 6,745 million outstanding shares (assuming the share price times outstanding shares gives total market capitalization), then:
\[ \text{Dividend Per Share} = \frac{\$23,100}{\text{Outstanding Shares}} \]
This value is also relevant to understanding return on common equity.

#### Market Capitalization and Headcount
Background context explaining what market capitalization and headcount represent in financial terms. Discuss their relevance to a company’s valuation and operational size.
:p What does market capitalization measure?
??x
Market capitalization measures the total value of a publicly traded company's outstanding shares of stock, calculated as:
\[ \text{Market Capitalization} = \text{Share Price} \times \text{Number of Shares Outstanding} \]
For example, if a company has a share price of $10 and 25 million shares outstanding, its market capitalization would be:
\[ \$10 \times 25,000,000 = \$250,000,000 \]
This figure is crucial for assessing the size and valuation of a company in the financial markets.

#### Order Book and Match Algorithms
Background context explaining order books, their structure (MBO vs. MBP), and how different match algorithms work. Discuss the importance of these concepts in trading.
:p What is an order book?
??x
An order book is an electronic ledger that records buy and sell orders for a specific security at a given trading venue. It has two main representations: Market by Order (MBO) and Market by Price (MBP).
- MBO shows each individual order with details on price, quantity, and time of entry.
- MBP consolidates orders into price buckets to display the total quantity at each price level.

For example:
```java
public class OrderBook {
    private Map<Double, List<Order>> buyOrders = new TreeMap<>();
    private Map<Double, List<Order>> sellOrders = new TreeMap<>();

    public void addOrder(Order order) {
        if (order.isBuy()) {
            buyOrders.compute(order.getPrice(), (price, list) -> {
                if (list == null) list = new ArrayList<>();
                list.add(order);
                return list;
            });
        } else {
            sellOrders.compute(order.getPrice(), (price, list) -> {
                if (list == null) list = new ArrayList<>();
                list.add(order);
                return list;
            });
        }
    }

    // Other methods to match orders and calculate bid/ask prices
}
```

#### OTC Markets and Forex Quotes

Background context: Over-the-Counter (OTC) markets, like foreign exchange (Forex) markets, are decentralized and do not have a centralized exchange. The exchange rate for currency pairs is determined by the supply and demand between individual participants.

In the Forex market, there is no enforced exchange rate for a specific currency pair. Instead, each quote provider sets its own rates based on their internal factors such as liquidity, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

:p What are some characteristics of quotes in OTC markets like Forex?
??x
Quotes in OTC markets like Forex have several key characteristics:
- Each quote is specific to the provider (your bank or a Forex broker).
- The exchange rate you see on Google for EUR/USD is not necessarily the market price.
- You should not expect it to match the one you get offered when converting money from one currency to another.

These variations are due to the decentralized nature of OTC markets and the individual strategies employed by different providers. 
??x
:p How does the tick size affect listed stock prices?
??x
The tick size is a minimum increment in which the price of a listed stock can change. This means that stock prices cannot fluctuate by less than this specific amount.

For example, according to SEC Rule 612:
- If the quotation, order, or indication of interest is priced equal to or greater than $1.00 per share, the minimum pricing increment must be no smaller than $0.01.
- For quotations, orders, or indications of interest priced less than $1.00 per share, the minimum pricing increment is $0.0001.

This rule ensures that stock prices are reported in a way that reflects their actual value more accurately and reduces market manipulation through small price changes. 
??x
:p What is nonsynchronous history in financial markets?
??x
Nonsynchronous history refers to discrepancies in the timing of transactions across different securities. For example, security A might trade once every minute while security B trades only once every five hours.

These differences are due to varying market liquidity and can lead to issues where one security’s price might not be up-to-date when referencing another security's transaction times. This is a significant challenge in real-time trading systems.
