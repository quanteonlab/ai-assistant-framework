**Starting Chapter:** 21.4 Analysis of Time-Varying Load

#### Time-Varying Arrival Rate (M t/M/1)
Background context: The example discusses a queue with a non-Markovian arrival process where the arrival rate changes over time, oscillating between $\lambda_H $ and$\lambda_L $. The system spends an exponential amount of time in each phase, denoted by $ Exp(\alpha_H)$for the high-rate regime and $ Exp(\alpha_L)$ for the low-rate regime. This is represented using a Markov-modulated Poisson process (MMPP).

The notation M t/M/1 indicates that the arrival rate $\lambda $ changes over time, whereas in the M/M t/1 queue, it would be the service rate$μ$ that varies.

:p What does the term "M t" signify in the context of a queueing system?
??x
In the notation M t/M/1, "M t" denotes a Markov-modulated Poisson process. This means the arrival rate $\lambda $ fluctuates between two values:$\lambda_H $ and$\lambda_L$, spending an exponential amount of time in each phase. The superscript indicates the current regime (high or low load).

```java
public class QueueExample {
    private double lambdaH; // High arrival rate
    private double lambdaL; // Low arrival rate
    private double alphaH;  // Parameter for high-rate regime duration
    private double alphaL;  // Parameter for low-rate regime duration
    
    public void updateArrivalRate(double time) {
        if (time < someThreshold) {
            lambda = lambdaH;
        } else {
            lambda = lambdaL;
        }
    }
}
```

#### Markov Chain for M t/M/1
Background context: To model the queue with a time-varying arrival rate, we need to create a Markov chain that tracks whether the system is operating in the high-load or low-load phase. The state of the Markov chain indicates both the number of jobs in the system and which regime (high load or low load) the system is currently in.

:p What does the Markov chain for M t/M/1 look like?
??x
The Markov chain for $M_t/M/1$ consists of two rows, each representing one of the phases: high load and low load. The state indicates the number of jobs in the system and which phase it is currently in.

```java
public class MTMarkovChain {
    private State state; // Indicates current regime (high or low)
    
    public enum State { HIGH_LOAD, LOW_LOAD }
    
    public void transition(double time) {
        if (time < someThreshold) {
            state = State.HIGH_LOAD;
        } else {
            state = State.LOW_LOAD;
        }
    }
}
```

#### Matrix-Analytic Method
Background context: Developed by Marcel Neuts, matrix-analytic methods are numerical techniques for solving inﬁnite-state Markov chains. These chains repeat after a certain point and grow unboundedly in no more than one dimension. They can be used to solve the chains discussed in Section 21.2.

Matrix-analytic methods provide approximate solutions by iteration, offering no closed-form symbolic solution but allowing efficient computation of specific instances.

:p What are matrix-analytic methods used for?
??x
Matrix-analytic methods are numerical techniques designed to solve infinite-state Markov chains where the chains repeat after some point and grow unboundedly in no more than one dimension. They allow solving complex systems that are difficult to handle using traditional methods, such as those seen in Section 21.2.

These methods work by iterating through the states of the chain until a stable solution is reached, providing approximate solutions rather than exact symbolic ones. This approach is efficient and can be computed within seconds for practical purposes.

```java
public class MatrixAnalyticSolver {
    private double[] transitionMatrix; // Transition matrix representing the Markov chain
    
    public void solve() {
        double initialSolution = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < maxIterations; i++) {
            double currentSolution = iterate(initialSolution);
            if (convergenceCriteria(currentSolution, initialSolution)) break;
            initialSolution = currentSolution;
        }
    }

    private double iterate(double solution) {
        // Perform matrix multiplication and other operations to update the solution
        return updatedSolution;
    }

    private boolean convergenceCriteria(double newSol, double oldSol) {
        // Check if the difference between solutions is within acceptable limits
        return Math.abs(newSol - oldSol) < tolerance;
    }
}
```

#### Matrix $R$ and Its Derivation

Background context: In matrix-analytic methods, particularly for the M/M/1 queue, we seek a recursive relationship between states using a matrix $R $. This matrix helps us express the limiting distribution vector $\pi_i$ in terms of previous distributions.

:p How is the matrix $R$ derived and used in this context?
??x
The matrix $R$ is derived by transforming the balance equations into a recursive form. For the M/M/1 queue, we have:
$$\pi_i = \pi_{i-1} \cdot R$$where $ R$ is such that when multiplied with the vector of previous states' probabilities, it gives the next state's probabilities.

To find $R $, we use the balance equations derived from the generator matrix $ Q$.

For example, for a single state transition:
$$0 = \pi_0(-\lambda) + \pi_1(\mu)$$
$$0 = \pi_0(\lambda) + \pi_1(-(λ + μ)) + \pi_2(\mu)$$

These equations can be solved iteratively to find $R$.

?: The logic behind using the balance equations and how they are transformed into matrix form.
??x
The balance equations represent the flow of probabilities between states in a queue. By expressing these flows as linear combinations, we can write them in matrix form. This allows us to use iterative methods or solve the resulting system of equations to find $R$.

For instance, if we have the balance equation:
$$0 = -\lambda \pi_0 + \mu \pi_1$$

We can rewrite this as a matrix product:
$$\begin{bmatrix} -\lambda & \mu \\ \lambda & -(λ + μ) \\ \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \pi_0 \\ \pi_1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$$

This matrix is part of the generator matrix $Q$. By solving this system iteratively, we can find the limiting distribution.

: Code example to solve for $R$ using iterative methods.
??x
```java
public class MatrixSolver {
    public static double[][] solveForR(double lambda, double mu) {
        // Initial guess or zero matrix
        double[][] initialGuess = {{0.5, 0.5}, {lambda / (lambda + mu), -mu / (lambda + mu)}};

        // Iterative method to refine R
        for (int iteration = 0; iteration < 1000; iteration++) {
            double[] prevRColumn1 = solveColumn(initialGuess[0], lambda, mu);
            double[] prevRColumn2 = solveColumn(initialGuess[1], lambda, mu);

            // Update R based on the previous values
            initialGuess[0] = new double[]{prevRColumn1[0], prevRColumn2[0]};
            initialGuess[1] = new double[]{prevRColumn1[1], prevRColumn2[1]};
        }

        return initialGuess;
    }

    private static double[] solveColumn(double[] column, double lambda, double mu) {
        // Solve the linear system for each column
        // This is a simplified example; actual implementation would involve more complex methods
        return new double[]{lambda / (lambda + mu), -mu / (lambda + mu)};
    }
}
```

#### Generator Matrix $Q $ Background context: The generator matrix$Q$ in the M/M/1 queue is a crucial component that encapsulates the transition rates between states. It helps derive the balance equations and subsequently find the limiting distribution.

:p How to write down the generator matrix $Q$ for an M/M/1 queue?
??x
The generator matrix $Q$ for an M/M/1 queue can be written as a block structure, where each state transition is represented. It has a special form that includes both arrival and service rates.

For example:
$$Q = \begin{bmatrix}
-\lambda & \lambda \\
\mu & -(\lambda + \mu)
\end{bmatrix}$$

This matrix captures the transitions from one state to another, where $\lambda $ is the arrival rate and$\mu$ is the service rate.

: Code example to construct $Q$.
??x
```java
public class QueueGenerator {
    public static double[][] generateMm1Matrix(double lambda, double mu) {
        int size = 2; // For simplicity, only two states (0H, 0L)
        double[][] Q = new double[size][size];

        // Fill the matrix with rates
        Q[0][0] = -lambda;
        Q[0][1] = lambda;

        Q[1][0] = mu;
        Q[1][1] = -(mu + lambda);

        return Q;
    }
}
```

#### Matrix $Q$ for M<sub>t</sub>/M/1 Queue

Background context: For the M<sub>t</sub>/M/1 queue, the generator matrix $Q$ is more complex due to time-varying arrival rates. It incorporates both high (H) and low (L) states of the system.

:p How to write down the generator matrix $Q$ for an M<sub>t</sub>/M/1 queue?
??x
The generator matrix $Q$ for an M<sub>t</sub>/M/1 queue can be written as a block structure that accounts for both high (H) and low (L) states. It includes transition rates between these states.

For example:
$$Q = \begin{bmatrix}
\text{0H} & \text{0L} & 1H & 1L & 2H & 2L & \cdots \\
-\left(\lambda_H + \alpha_H\right) & \frac{\alpha_H}{|\lambda_H|} & \mu_0 & 0 & \frac{\alpha_L}{|\lambda_L|} & -\left(\lambda_L + \alpha_L + \mu\right) & \cdots \\
0 & \mu & -\left(\lambda_H + \alpha_H + \mu\right) & \frac{\alpha_H}{|\lambda_H|} & 0 & -\left(\lambda_L + \alpha_L + \mu\right) & \cdots \\
2H / |\mu_0| & \mu / |\mu_0| & 0 & -\left(\lambda_H + \alpha_H + \mu\right) & 2L / |\mu_0| & \mu / |\mu_0| & \cdots
\end{bmatrix}$$: Code example to construct $ Q$.
??x
```java
public class MtM1Generator {
    public static double[][] generateMtM1Matrix(double lambdaH, double alphaH, double mu0, double lambdaL, double alphaL, double mu) {
        int size = 6; // For simplicity, only three states (0H, 0L, 1H)
        double[][] Q = new double[size][size];

        // Fill the matrix with rates
        Q[0][0] = -lambdaH - alphaH;
        Q[0][3] = mu0;

        Q[1][1] = lambdaH + alphaH + mu;
        Q[1][2] = 0;
        Q[1][4] = alphaL / Math.abs(lambdaL);
        Q[1][5] = -lambdaL - alphaL - mu;

        Q[2][2] = mu0;
        Q[2][3] = -lambdaH - alphaH - mu;
        Q[2][4] = 0;
        Q[2][5] = -lambdaL - alphaL - mu;

        return Q;
    }
}
```

#### Vector $\pi_i $ Background context: The vector$\pi_i$ represents the limiting distribution of probabilities for each state in the M<sub>t</sub>/M/1 queue. It is composed of both high (H) and low (L) states.

:p What is the form of the vector $\pi_i$?
??x
The vector $\pi_i$ consists of elements representing the limiting probabilities for each state, where states are divided into high (H) and low (L) categories. For example, if we have 3 states, it would look like:
$$\pi = (\pi_0^H, \pi_0^L, \pi_1^H, \pi_1^L, \pi_2^H, \pi_2^L, \cdots)$$: Example of vector $\pi_i$.
??x
For instance:
$$\pi = (π_{0}^{H}, π_{0}^{L}, π_{1}^{H}, π_{1}^{L}, π_{2}^{H}, π_{2}^{L})$$x??

#### Generator Matrix $Q$ Structure

Background context: The generator matrix $Q$ for the M<sub>t</sub>/M/1 queue is structured in a way that includes multiple 2×2 matrices repeated and one non-repeating block.

:p How does the structure of the generator matrix $Q$ look?
??x
The generator matrix $Q$ has a specific structure where it repeats three 2×2 blocks plus an initial local block. Here is how it looks:
$$Q = \begin{bmatrix}
\text{Backwards} & \text{Forwards} \\
\text{Initial Local} & \text{Local} & \text{Local} & \cdots
\end{bmatrix}$$

Where:
- B (Backwards) handles transitions from $i+1 $ to$i $- F (Forwards) handles transitions from$ i $to$ i+1$- L (Initial Local) and L (Local) handle local transitions within states.

: Example of the matrix structure.
??x$$Q = \begin{bmatrix}
0H & 0L & 1H & 1L & 2H & 2L \\
-\left(\lambda_H + \alpha_H\right) & \frac{\alpha_H}{|\lambda_H|} & \mu_0 & 0 & \frac{\alpha_L}{|\lambda_L|} & -\left(\lambda_L + \alpha_L + \mu\right) \\
0 & \mu & -\left(\lambda_H + \alpha_H + \mu\right) & \frac{\alpha_H}{|\lambda_H|} & 0 & -\left(\lambda_L + \alpha_L + \mu\right) \\
2H / |\mu_0| & \mu / |\mu_0| & 0 & -\left(\lambda_H + \alpha_H + \mu\right) & 2L / |\mu_0| & \mu / |\mu_0| \\
\vdots
\end{bmatrix}$$x??

#### Phase-Type Distributions and Matrix-Analytic Methods Overview
Phase-type distributions are used to model the time until an event occurs, often represented by a continuous-time Markov chain. The balance equations for these distributions can be written in matrix form, leading to a system of linear equations that need solving.

:p What is the general approach to solve the balance equations for phase-type distributions?
??x
The balance equations are solved using matrix-analytic methods. Specifically, we make an educated guess $\vec{\pi}_i = \vec{\pi}_0 R^i $ for$i > 0 $, where $\vec{\pi}_0 = (\pi_0H, \pi_0L)$ and $R$ is a matrix to be determined. This leads to the equation $F + RL + R^2B = 0$, which is solved iteratively.
x??

---
#### Iterative Solution for Matrix $R $ We use an iterative approach to determine the matrix$R $. The process involves initializing$ R_0$ and then updating it until convergence.

:p How does the iteration process work to find $R$?
??x
1. Initialize $R_0 = 0$(or a better initial guess if available).
2. Use the iterative formula:
$$R_{n+1} = -\left(R_n^2 B + F\right) L^{-1}$$3. Continue iterating until the norm of the difference between $ R_{n+1}$and $ R_n$is less than a specified threshold $\epsilon_1$. Typically, the maximum element-wise difference is used.

Example pseudocode for iteration:
```java
Matrix R = new Matrix(0); // Initialize with zero matrix

while (||R - R_prev|| > epsilon1) {
    R_prev = R;
    R = -((R_prev.pow(2).multiply(B)).add(F)).multiply(L).inverse();
}
```

#### Finding $\vec{\pi}_0 $ Once$R $ converges, we can determine the limiting probabilities by substituting back into the balance equations. The vector$\vec{\pi}_0$ is found using normalization.

:p How do you find $\vec{\pi}_0 $ given that$R$ has converged?
??x
We use the normalized equation:
$$\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \vec{\pi}_i \cdot \vec{1} = 1, \quad \text{where } \vec{1} = (1, 1)$$

Rewriting in terms of $\vec{\pi}_0 $ and using the form$\vec{\pi}_i = \vec{\pi}_0 R^i$, we get:
$$\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \vec{\pi}_0 (R^i) \cdot \vec{1} = 1$$

This simplifies to:
$$\vec{\pi}_0 (I - R)^{-1} \vec{1} = 1$$

Let $\Phi = L_0 + RB $ and$\Psi = (I - R)^{-1} \vec{1}$. The balance equation becomes:
$$\vec{\pi}_0 \Phi = 0, \quad \text{and} \quad \vec{\pi}_0 \Psi = 1$$

Solving the system:
$$\begin{bmatrix}
\pi_{0H} & \pi_{0L}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\Psi_0 & \Phi_{01} \\
\Psi_1 & \Phi_{11}
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}$$

This system has a unique solution, and we solve for $\vec{\pi}_0 = (\pi_{0H}, \pi_{0L})$.

x??

#### Convergence Criteria in Iteration Process
The iteration process stops when the difference between successive iterations is smaller than a threshold value.

:p What criteria define the convergence of $R$ during the iterative solution?
??x
Convergence is typically checked by comparing the maximum absolute difference between consecutive matrix elements:
$$||R_{n+1} - R_n||$$

If this norm exceeds $\epsilon_1 $, continue iterating. The process stops when all element-wise differences are smaller than $\epsilon_1 $. A common initial value for $\epsilon_1 $ is$10^{-7}$, but if convergence is slow,$\epsilon_1$ can be increased by a factor of 10.

Example code to check convergence:
```java
double epsilon1 = 1e-7;
while (norm(R_prev - R) > epsilon1) {
    R_prev = R;
    R = -((R_prev.pow(2).multiply(B)).add(F)).multiply(L).inverse();
}
```
x??

---
#### Normalization Equation for $\vec{\pi}_0$ The normalization equation ensures that the limiting probabilities sum to 1.

:p How is the vector $\vec{\pi}_0 $ determined after$R$ has been found?
??x
After finding $R$, we use the normalization condition:
$$\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \vec{\pi}_i \cdot \vec{1} = 1$$

This simplifies to:
$$\vec{\pi}_0 (I - R)^{-1} \vec{1} = 1$$

Letting $\Psi = (I - R)^{-1} \vec{1}$, we get the system of equations:
$$\begin{bmatrix}
\pi_{0H} & \pi_{0L}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\Psi_0 & \Phi_{01} \\
\Psi_1 & \Phi_{11}
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}$$

Solving this system, we find the unique solution for $\vec{\pi}_0 = (\pi_{0H}, \pi_{0L})$.

#### E[N] Calculation Using Matrix-Analytic Methods
Background context: We derive a closed-form expression for $E[N]$ using matrix-analytic methods. The performance metric involves the limiting probabilities $\pi_0$ and the matrix $R$.

:p How do we calculate $E[N]$?
??x
We use the following formula:
$$E[N] = \pi_0 \cdot (I - R)^{-2} \cdot R \cdot \vec{1}$$

This expression leverages the fact that $E[N] = \sum_{i=0}^\infty i \cdot \pi_i \cdot \vec{1}$. The matrix $ R$is derived from the structure of the Markov chain, and $\pi_0$ represents the initial state probabilities.

For higher moments, similar derivations can be applied by considering the respective powers and sums.
x??

#### Average Arrival Rate (λavg)
Background context: We define the average arrival rate for an M/M/1 system using two different rates based on whether the system is non-empty or empty. This allows us to account for varying workloads.

:p How do we calculate λavg?
??x
The formula for $\lambda_{avg}$ is:
$$\lambda_{avg} = \frac{\alpha_H \lambda_H + 1}{\alpha_H + 1} + \frac{\alpha_L \lambda_L}{\alpha_H + 1}$$

Where:
- $\alpha_H $ and$\alpha_L$ are scaling factors for the high and low arrival rates, respectively.
- $\lambda_H$ is the high arrival rate when the system is non-empty.
- $\lambda_L$ is the low arrival rate when the system is empty.

This formula allows us to handle systems with varying load conditions by adjusting the average arrival rate based on the state of the queue.
x??

#### M∗/E∗ 2/1 Chain Example
Background context: The example provides a more complex chain where the non-repeating portion starts after level $M$. We need to define states and transition rates for this specific scenario.

:p What is Q expressed in terms of $a_1 $ and$a_2$?
??x
The matrix $Q$ can be defined as:
$$Q = \begin{bmatrix}
(0,0) & (0 ,1) & (0 ,2) & (1 ,1) & (1 ,2) & (2 ,1) & (2 ,2) & (3 ,1) & (3 ,2) \\
\hline
(0,0) -\lambda/\prime & \lambda/0 & 0/| | | 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
(0,1) 0 & a_1 & \mu_1/| | | \lambda & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
(0,2) \mu_2 & 0 & a_2/| | | 0 & \lambda & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots
\end{bmatrix}$$

Where:
- $a_1 = -(\lambda + \mu_1)$-$ a_2 = -(\lambda + \mu_2)$ The matrix includes states with the number of jobs in queue and the phase of service, handling both empty and non-empty conditions.
x??

#### Matrix Calculation for M∗/E∗ 2/1
Background context: For more complex chains, we need to determine $R $ and initial state probabilities$\pi_0$. The chain starts repeating after a certain level, requiring larger matrices.

:p What is the value of $M$ in this example?
??x
In the given M∗/E∗ 2/1 chain,$M = 1$.

This means that the non-repeating portion starts at state (0,0) and continues up to state (1,2), with further states repeating. The matrix $L_0 $ is a$3 \times 3$ matrix representing the initial segment of the chain.
x??

#### Iterative Solution for R
Background context: We need to solve for $R $ iteratively in cases where the non-repeating portion starts after level$M$.

:p How do we solve for $R$ using iteration?
??x
We start with an initial guess $R_0 = 0$. The iterative process is as follows:

1. Initialize $R_n = 0$.
2. Iterate until convergence: 
   $$R_{n+1} = - (R_n^2 B + F) L^{-1}$$

Where:
- $F $ and$B$ are matrices defined for the chain.
- $L$ is a matrix representing the linear part of the equations.

The iteration stops when $||R_{n+1} - R_n|| < \epsilon $, where $\epsilon $ is a small tolerance value. This ensures that$R$ converges to its solution.
x??

#### Initial Limiting Probabilities
Background context: We need to determine initial limiting probabilities for states after the non-repeating part of the chain.

:p How do we determine $\pi_0 $ and$\pi_1$?
??x
The equations for determining $\pi_0 $ and$\pi_1$ are:
$$\begin{bmatrix} \vec{\pi}_0 & \vec{\pi}_1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} L_0 & F_0 \\ B_0 (L + R B) \end{bmatrix} = \vec{0}$$

Where:
- $L_0, F_0,$ and $B_0$ are submatrices of the transition matrix.
- The normalization equation is:
$$\vec{\pi}_0 \cdot \vec{1} + \sum_{i=0}^\infty \vec{\pi}_{1i} (R^i) \cdot \vec{1} = 1$$

This ensures that the sum of probabilities equals one and covers all states after the non-repeating part.

#### Phase-Type Distributions and Matrix-Analytic Methods Overview
Phase-type distributions are a powerful technique for representing general distributions through Markovian processes. They allow complex systems to be analyzed using matrix-based methods, such as solving balance equations and normalization constraints.

Matrix-analytic methods involve constructing matrices $\Phi $, $ F $,$ B $,$ L $, and$ R$ to solve for the limiting probabilities of a system. These methods are particularly useful in Markov models with general distributions but require careful consideration of the number of phases or parameters used.

:p What is the primary purpose of using phase-type distributions in matrix-analytic methods?
??x
The primary purpose is to represent complex, general distributions through simpler Markovian structures, allowing for tractable analysis and solution of limiting probabilities.

#### M/M/1 Queue Analysis Using Matrix-Analytic Methods
Given an M/M/1 queue with arrival rate $\lambda $ and service rate$\mu$, the matrix-analytic method involves constructing matrices to solve for the steady-state distribution.

The key steps include:
- Defining $Q$ (generator matrix)
- Determining $B$ (balking and reneging rates, if any)
- Calculating $L$ (service rate vector)
- Identifying $F$ (failure rate vector)

:p How would you solve for the steady-state probabilities of an M/M/1 queue using matrix-analytic methods?
??x
To solve for the steady-state probabilities:
1. Define the generator matrix $Q$.
2. Identify $B$ as it is zero in this case.
3. Calculate $L $ and$F$, which are typically vectors of service rates and failure rates, respectively.
4. Construct matrices to derive the limiting probabilities from balance equations.

For example:
```java
// Pseudocode for solving M/M/1 using matrix-analytic methods
public class MM1Queue {
    double lambda;
    double mu;

    public void solveSteadyState() {
        // Step 1: Define Q
        Matrix Q = new Matrix(n+1, n+1);

        // Step 2: Identify B as zero

        // Step 3: Calculate L and F
        Vector L = new Vector(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            L.set(i, mu); // For M/M/1, service rate is constant
        }

        Vector F = new Vector(1);

        // Step 4: Solve balance equations and normalization constraint to find π
    }
}
```

#### Time-Varying Load in M t/M/1 Queue
An M t/M/1 queue models a system with time-varying load, where the arrival rate $\lambda$ fluctuates between high-load (1.2) and low-load (0.2), each state being exponentially distributed.

The matrix-analytic method can be applied to determine mean response times for different switching rates $\alpha$.

:p How would you apply matrix-analytic methods to an M t/M/1 queue with time-varying load?
??x
To apply matrix-analytic methods:
1. Define the state space and Markov chain.
2. Construct the generator matrix $Q$.
3. Derive matrices such as $F $, $ B $,$ L $, and$ R$ based on the time-varying arrival rates.
4. Solve balance equations to find limiting probabilities.

For example:
```java
// Pseudocode for M t/M/1 with time-varying load
public class MTMM1 {
    double lambdaHigh, lambdaLow;
    double mu;

    public void solveResponseTime(double alpha) {
        // Define state space and Markov chain

        // Construct Q matrix based on high and low load states
        Matrix Q = new Matrix(n+2, n+2);

#### M/Cox/1 Queue Analysis
The M/Cox/1 queue models a system where the service times follow a phase-type distribution with 2 stages. Each stage has an exponential duration with rates $\mu_1 $ and$\mu_2 $, invoked with probability $ p$.

:p How would you analyze an M/Cox/1 queue using matrix-analytic methods?
??x
To analyze the M/Cox/1 queue:
1. Define the state space.
2. Draw out the Markov chain.
3. Write the generator matrix $Q$.
4. Derive matrices $F_0 $, $ L_0 $,$ B_0 $,$ F $,$ L $, and$ B$.
5. Solve balance equations for limiting probabilities.

For example:
```java
// Pseudocode for M/Cox/1 queue analysis
public class MCox1Queue {
    double lambda;
    double mu1, mu2;
    double p;

    public void solveLimitingProbabilities() {
        // Define state space and Markov chain

        // Construct Q matrix with phase-type service time distribution
        Matrix Q = new Matrix(n+2, n+2);

        // Derive F0, L0, B0 matrices based on μ1 and μ2 values and probability p

        // Solve balance equations to find π
    }
}
```

#### Effect of Variability in Service Time on M/H 2/1 Queue
The Hyperexponential distribution $H_2 $ is used with a balanced branches structure. The mean service time$E[S] = 1 $ and coefficient of variation squared$C^2 = 10$.

Matrix-analytic methods are applied to determine the mean response time for an M/H 2/1 queue under varying load conditions.

:p How would you analyze the effect of increased variability in service time on the M/H 2/1 queue using matrix-analytic methods?
??x
To analyze:
1. Define $H_2$ with balanced branches and given parameters.
2. Use matrix-analytic methods to determine mean response times for varying load conditions.

For example:
```java
// Pseudocode for analyzing M/H 2/1 queue
public class MH2Queue {
    double lambda;
    double[] mu = {1, 3}; // μ1 and μ2 with p=0.5
    double C2;

    public void analyzeResponseTime(double rho) {
        // Define state space and Markov chain

        // Construct Q matrix for H2 distribution

        // Derive matrices based on service time parameters and load ρ

        // Solve balance equations to find mean response time E[T]
    }
}
```

#### Variance of Number of Jobs in M/M/1 Queue
The variance of the number of jobs $N$ can be derived using matrix-analytic methods, extending from the mean derivation.

:p How would you derive a closed-form expression for the variance of the number of jobs $N$ in an M/M/1 queue?
??x
To derive the variance:
1. Start with the mean number of jobs formula.
2. Use matrix calculus to extend and find the variance.

For example:
```java
// Pseudocode for deriving variance in M/M/1 queue
public class MM1Variance {
    double lambda;
    double mu;

    public void deriveVariance() {
        // Mean derivation is λ / μ

        // Variance formula using matrix-analytic methods involves additional steps
        double mean = lambda / mu;
        double variance = (lambda * (mu - lambda)) / (mu * mu);

        System.out.println("Mean: " + mean);
        System.out.println("Variance: " + variance);
    }
}
```

#### Setup Time in M/M/1 and M/M/2 Queues
The setup time $I$ introduces additional complexity to the system, changing the behavior of the queue.

:p How would you model an M/M/1 or M/M/2 queue with a setup time $I$?
??x
To model:
1. Define states that account for setup times.
2. Modify the Markov chain to include these states.
3. Adjust the generator matrix $Q$ and other necessary matrices.

For example:
```java
// Pseudocode for M/M/1 with setup time
public class MM1Setup {
    double lambda;
    double mu;
    double alpha;

    public void analyzeResponseTime() {
        // Define states including setup

        // Construct modified generator matrix Q

        // Solve balance equations to find response times
    }
}
```

```java
// Pseudocode for M/M/2 with setup time
public class MM2Setup {
    double lambda;
    double mu;
    double alpha;

    public void analyzeResponseTime() {
        // Define states including setup

        // Construct modified generator matrix Q

        // Solve balance equations to find response times
    }
}
```
