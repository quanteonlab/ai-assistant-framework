**Starting Chapter:** 23.4 Applying Renewal-Reward to Get Expected Excess

---

#### Renewal Process Definition
A renewal process is a stochastic process where the times between events are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables with a common distribution function \( F \). This means that each event's timing is independent of previous events, and all inter-event intervals have the same probability distribution.

The definition provided states:
- Any process for which the times between events are i.i.d. r.v.s with a common distribution, \( F \), is called a renewal process.

:p What does a renewal process involve in terms of event timing?
??x
A renewal process involves events occurring at random intervals where each interval is an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variable drawn from the same distribution function \( F \). Each event's timing is independent of previous events, and all inter-event intervals have the same probability distribution.

#### Renewal-Reward Theorem
The theorem allows us to compute the long-term average reward earned in a renewal process. It states that if we receive rewards at each renewal event with a mean \( E[R] \) and the time between events has a mean \( E[X] \), then the long-term average rate of earning rewards is given by:
\[ \lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{R(t)}{t} = \frac{E[R]}{E[X]} \]

:p What does Renewal-Reward Theorem help us calculate?
??x
Renewal-Reward Theorem helps us calculate the long-term average rate of earning rewards in a renewal process. This is done by dividing the expected reward per cycle \( E[R] \) by the expected length of one cycle \( E[X] \).

x??

---

#### Time-Average Excess Definition
In the context of a renewal process, the excess at time \( t \), denoted as \( S_e(t) \), is defined as the amount of service time remaining after \( t \). For example, if we are considering a queueing system where services end at the end of each cycle, the excess will be the leftover service time that hasn't been completed by time \( t \).

The function \( S_e(t) \) represents the excess service time at time \( t \), as shown in Figure 23.6.

:p How is the expected excess calculated?
??x
The expected excess \( E[S_e] \) is calculated using the long-run average of the excess service times:
\[ E[S_e] = \lim_{s \to \infty} \frac{1}{s} \int_0^s S_e(t) dt. \]

This means we need to compute the time-average excess by integrating \( S_e(t) \) over a long period and then taking the limit as that period approaches infinity.

x??

---

#### Applying Renewal-Reward to Get Expected Excess
To apply the Renewal-Reward theorem in calculating the expected excess, we define:
- \( R(s) = \int_0^s S_e(t) dt \), which is the total reward (excess service time) earned by time \( s \).

The time-average reward is given by:
\[ \lim_{s \to \infty} \frac{R(s)}{s} = E[S_e]. \]

:p What is \( R(s) \) in the context of calculating expected excess?
??x
In the context of calculating expected excess, \( R(s) \) represents the total reward (excess service time) earned by time \( s \):
\[ R(s) = \int_0^s S_e(t) dt. \]

This integral sums up the excess service times from time 0 to \( s \).

x??

---

#### Cycle Definition in Renewal-Reward
A cycle is defined as one complete event interval in a renewal process. In the context of queueing, it often refers to one full service completion.

:p What constitutes a "cycle" in a renewal process?
??x
In a renewal process, a cycle is defined as one complete event interval. For instance, in a queueing system, a cycle typically corresponds to the time taken for one complete service or an entire event from start to finish.

x??

---

#### Time-Average Reward and Renewal-Reward Theory
Background context: We use Renewal-Reward theory to determine the time-average reward, which is the same as the time-average excess. The formula for this is derived by considering the reward earned during a cycle.

:p How can we derive the time-average reward using Renewal-Reward theory?
??x
To derive the time-average reward, consider that the reward earned during one cycle is given by \(\int_0^S (S-t) \, dt = S^2 / 2\). The expected reward earned during a cycle can be calculated as \(E[S^2] / 2\), where \(E[S]\) is the expected length of one cycle. Thus, the time-average reward is:
\[ E[Se] = \frac{E[S^2]}{2E[S]} \]

This derivation was a calculus-based argument needed when the reward function is complex.

??x
```java
public class TimeAverageReward {
    public double calculateTimeAverageReward(double E_S, double E_S_squared) {
        return E_S_squared / (2 * E_S);
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Inspection Paradox
Background context: The inspection paradox occurs when a random arrival is more likely to land in an interval that is longer than the average. This can be observed in various scenarios, such as bus arrivals.

:p What is the expected waiting time for a bus if buses arrive every 10 minutes on average and the inter-arrival times are exponentially distributed?
??x
The expected waiting time for a bus, given exponential inter-arrival times with an average of 10 minutes, can be calculated using:
\[ E[Se] = \frac{E[S^2]}{2E[S]} \]

Since \(E[S]\) is the mean of the exponential distribution (which is 10 minutes), and for an exponential distribution \(E[S^2] = 2(E[S])^2\):
\[ E[Se] = \frac{2(10)^2}{2 \cdot 10} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the expected waiting time is 10 minutes.

??x
```java
public class BusWaitingTime {
    public double calculateExpectedWaitingTime(double meanArrivalTime) {
        // For exponential distribution with mean arrival time of 10 minutes
        return meanArrivalTime;
    }
}
```

#### M/G/1 Queue and Expected Excess Time
Background context: In an M/G/1 queue, the expected excess time (time until next service starts) is a key concept. The formula for this is derived from Renewal-Reward theory.

:p What does \(E[Se]\) represent in the context of the M/G/1 queue?
??x
In the context of the M/G/1 queue, \(E[Se]\) represents the expected remaining service time on the job at the time of an arrival, given that there is a job in service. The formula for \(E[Se]\) can be derived using Renewal-Reward theory and is:
\[ E[Se] = \frac{E[S^2]}{2E[S]} \]

This value represents the expected remaining time until the next service starts.

??x
```java
public class M_G_1Queue {
    public double calculateExpectedExcessTime(double meanServiceTime, double varianceServiceTime) {
        return (meanServiceTime * (1 + varianceServiceTime / meanServiceTime));
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Pollaczek-Khinchin Formula in M/G/1 Queue
Background context: The Pollaczek-Khinchin (P-K) formula is used to determine the expected waiting time in an M/G/1 queue. This formula incorporates the variability of service times.

:p How does the Pollaczek-Khinchin formula account for delays in an M/G/1 queue?
??x
The Pollaczek-Khinchin formula accounts for delays by incorporating the variability in service times. For an M/G/1 queue, the expected waiting time \(E[TQ]\) can be expressed as:
\[ E[TQ] = \frac{\rho}{1 - \rho} \cdot \frac{E[S^2]}{2E[S]} \]
Where \(\rho\) is the utilization factor and \(E[S^2]\) represents the expected remaining service time squared. The formula becomes:
\[ E[TQ] = \frac{\rho}{1 - \rho} \cdot \frac{E[S]}{2} (C_S^2 + 1) \]
And in another form:
\[ E[TQ] = \lambda \cdot \frac{E[S^2]}{2(1 - \rho)} \]

This shows that delays are proportional to the variance in service times.

??x
```java
public class M_G_1Queue {
    public double calculateExpectedWaitingTime(double rho, double meanServiceTime, double varianceServiceTime) {
        return (rho / (1 - rho)) * ((meanServiceTime * (1 + varianceServiceTime / meanServiceTime)));
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Variability and Delay in Queues
Background context: The variability of service times affects the expected waiting time significantly. This is evident from the Pollaczek-Khinchin formula, where higher variability leads to increased delays.

:p How does high variability in service times affect the expected delay in an M/G/1 queue?
??x
High variability in service times increases the expected delay in an M/G/1 queue because the formula for expected waiting time \(E[TQ]\) includes a term proportional to the square of the mean service time and the coefficient of variation squared plus one:
\[ E[TQ] = \frac{\rho}{1 - \rho} \cdot \frac{E[S^2]}{2E[S]} \]

This means that even under low utilization, if \(C_S^2\) (variance divided by mean square) is high, the expected delay can be very large.

??x
```java
public class DelayCalculation {
    public double calculateExpectedDelay(double rho, double meanServiceTime, double varianceServiceTime) {
        return (rho / (1 - rho)) * ((meanServiceTime * (1 + varianceServiceTime / meanServiceTime)));
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Variance of Waiting Time in M/G/1 Queue
Background context: The variance of the waiting time in an M/G/1 queue is given by a formula that includes the third moment of the service time.

:p What formula describes the variance of the waiting time \(Var(TQ)\) in an M/G/1 queue?
??x
The variance of the waiting time \(Var(TQ)\) in an M/G/1 queue can be calculated using:
\[ Var(TQ) = (E[TQ])^2 + \lambda E[S^3] / 3(1 - \rho) \]

This formula shows that the second moment of delay depends on the third moment of service time, similar to how the first moment of delay depends on the second moment of service times.

??x
```java
public class WaitingTimeVariance {
    public double calculateWaitingTimeVariance(double E_TQ, double lambda, double meanServiceTimeCubed) {
        return (Math.pow(E_TQ, 2)) + (lambda * meanServiceTimeCubed / (3 * (1 - 0.5)));
    }
}
```
x??

#### M/H 2/1 Queue Excess and Waiting Time
Background context: In an M/H 2/1 queue, jobs arrive according to a Poisson process with rate \(\lambda\), and service times follow some heavy-tailed distribution. The goal is to derive expressions for the expected excess time \(E[\text{Excess}]\) and the expected waiting time in the queue \(E[T_Q]\).

:p What are the expressions for \(E[\text{Excess}]\) and \(E[T_Q]\) in an M/H 2/1 queue?
??x
To derive these, we need to understand that in an M/H 2/1 queue, the service times can be quite variable. The expected excess time can often be derived using renewal theory, and for waiting time, it involves understanding the busy period behavior of the system.

The exact expressions would typically involve complex integrals or sums over the distribution of service times \(H\), which are not straightforward to compute without specific details about the heavy-tailed distribution. However, a common approach is to use the Pollaczek-Khintchine formula for M/G/1 queues and then adapt it for the heavy-tailed case.

For simplicity, let's denote the mean service time by \(\mu\) and the variance of the service times by \(\sigma^2\). The key steps would involve:
1. Understanding the busy period distribution.
2. Using renewal theory to find \(E[\text{Excess}]\).
3. Applying queueing theory principles to find \(E[T_Q]\).

In a real scenario, you might need to solve these using specific distributions or approximations.

```java
// Pseudocode for understanding concepts
public class M_H_Queue {
    double lambda; // Arrival rate
    Function<Double, Double> serviceTimeDistribution; // Service time distribution
    
    public void calculateExcessAndWaiting() {
        // Implement complex calculations here based on the service time distribution
    }
}
```

#### Doubling CPU Service Rate and Arrival Rate
Background context: In a system with a single CPU serving jobs according to an M/G/1 model, if the arrival rate \(\lambda\) doubles, we can compensate by doubling the service capacity. The key is to understand how this affects the mean response time.

:p How does doubling the arrival rate and service rate affect the mean response time in an M/G/1 system?
??x
In an M/G/1 queue, the mean response time \(E[T]\) is given by:
\[ E[T] = \frac{1 + \rho}{\mu - \lambda} \]
where \(\rho = \lambda \cdot E[S]\) and \(\mu\) is the service rate.

If we double the arrival rate and the service rate, the new parameters become \(2\lambda\) and \(2\mu\). The new load factor \(\rho_{\text{new}}\) becomes:
\[ \rho_{\text{new}} = 2\lambda \cdot E[S] / (2\mu) = \rho \]
Since the load factor remains the same, the mean response time in the new system is also the same as the original one.

Thus, doubling both the arrival rate and service rate does not change the mean response time:
\[ E[T_{\text{new}}] = E[T_{\text{original}}} \]

```java
// Pseudocode for understanding concept
public class CPUService {
    double lambda; // Original arrival rate
    double mu;     // Original service rate
    
    public void updateRates(double newLambda, double newMu) {
        if (newLambda == 2 * lambda && newMu == 2 * mu) {
            System.out.println("Mean response time remains the same.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Need to recalculate mean response time.");
        }
    }
}
```

#### M/G/1 with Different Job Types
Background context: Consider an M/G/1 queue where there are two types of jobs (red and blue) arriving according to Poisson processes. Red jobs have a different arrival rate and service requirements compared to blue jobs.

:p What is the mean response time for red and blue jobs in this scenario?
??x
In an M/G/1 system with multiple job types, we need to calculate the mean response times separately for each type of job based on their respective arrival rates and service distributions.

Given:
- Red jobs: Arrival rate \(\lambda_R = 0.25\) jobs/sec, Service size \(E[R] = 1\), Variance \(\sigma^2_R = 1\)
- Blue jobs: Arrival rate \(\lambda_B = 0.5\) jobs/sec, Service size \(E[B] = 0.5\), Variance \(\sigma^2_B = 1\)

The mean response time for a job in an M/G/1 queue can be approximated using the Pollaczek-Khintchine formula:
\[ E[T] = \frac{1 + \rho}{\mu - \lambda} \]

For red jobs, with \(\rho_R = \lambda_R / (\mu_R)\):
\[ E[T_{R}] = \frac{1 + \frac{\lambda_R}{E[R]}}{\frac{1}{E[R]} - \lambda_R} \]
Since \(E[R] = 1\), this simplifies to:
\[ E[T_{R}] = \frac{1 + \lambda_R}{1 - \lambda_R} = \frac{1 + 0.25}{1 - 0.25} = \frac{1.25}{0.75} = \frac{5}{3} \text{ seconds} \]

For blue jobs, with \(\rho_B = \lambda_B / (\mu_B)\):
\[ E[T_{B}] = \frac{1 + \frac{\lambda_B}{E[B]}}{\frac{1}{E[B]} - \lambda_B} \]
Since \(E[B] = 0.5\), this simplifies to:
\[ E[T_{B}] = \frac{1 + \lambda_B / 0.5}{2 - \lambda_B} = \frac{1 + 1}{2 - 0.5} = \frac{2}{1.5} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ seconds} \]

Thus, the mean response time for red jobs is approximately \(1.67\) seconds and for blue jobs, it is approximately \(1.33\) seconds.

```java
// Pseudocode for calculating mean response times
public class JobResponseTimes {
    double lambdaR; // Arrival rate of red jobs
    double E_R;     // Mean service time of red jobs
    double lambdaB; // Arrival rate of blue jobs
    double E_B;     // Mean service time of blue jobs
    
    public void calculateMeanResponse() {
        double rhoR = lambdaR / E_R;
        double rhoB = lambdaB / E_B;
        
        double ER = 1 + rhoR;
        double EB = 1 + rhoB;
        
        double MR = ER / (E_R - lambdaR);
        double MB = EB / (E_B - lambdaB);
        
        System.out.println("Mean response time for red jobs: " + MR);
        System.out.println("Mean response time for blue jobs: " + MB);
    }
}
```

#### Inspection Paradox
Background context: The inspection paradox occurs when the observed average of a sample is different from its expected value due to the way we observe data. In this problem, two types of renewals (short and long) are considered.

:p Calculate the average length of a renewal, the probability that a randomly thrown dart lands in a long renewal, and the expected length of a renewal if you arrive at a random time.
??x
1. **Average Length of a Renewal:**
   - The total rate of renewals is \(\lambda_S + \lambda_L = 2/3 + 1/3 = 1\).
   - The average length of a renewal is the reciprocal of this rate:
     \[ E[A] = 1 / (\lambda_S + \lambda_L) = 1 \]

2. **Probability that a Dart Lands in a Long Renewal:**
   - Probability \(P(\text{long}) = 1/3\).

3. **Expected Length of a Randomly Thrown Dart:**
   - Let \(X\) be the length of a randomly chosen renewal.
   - The expected value of \(X\) given that it is long or short can be calculated using conditional probability:
     \[ E[X] = P(\text{long}) \cdot E[X|\text{long}] + P(\text{short}) \cdot E[X|\text{short}] \]
     \[ E[X] = (1/3) \cdot 10 + (2/3) \cdot 1 = 4/3 + 10/3 = 14/3 \]

Thus, the expected length of a randomly thrown dart is \(14/3\) units.

```java
// Pseudocode for calculating inspection paradox values
public class InspectionParadox {
    double lambda_S; // Rate of short renewals
    double lambda_L; // Rate of long renewals
    
    public void calculateValues() {
        double total_rate = lambda_S + lambda_L;
        
        // Average length of a renewal
        double E_A = 1 / total_rate;
        
        // Probability of landing in a long renewal
        double P_long = lambda_L / total_rate;
        
        // Expected length given random selection
        double E_X = (P_long * 10) + ((1 - P_long) * 1);
        
        System.out.println("Average length: " + E_A);
        System.out.println("Probability of long renewal: " + P_long);
        System.out.println("Expected length of a random dart: " + E_X);
    }
}
```

#### M/H 2/1 Queue Excess and Waiting Time (continued)
Background context: In an M/H 2/1 queue, the key is to understand how the excess time \(E[\text{Excess}]\) and waiting time in the queue \(E[T_Q]\) are calculated. The Pollaczek-Khintchine formula for an M/G/1 queue can be adapted for heavy-tailed distributions.

:p How does one calculate the expected excess time \(E[\text{Excess}]\) in an M/H 2/1 queue?
??x
To calculate the expected excess time \(E[\text{Excess}]\) in an M/H 2/1 queue, we need to consider the busy period distribution and use renewal theory. The Pollaczek-Khintchine formula for an M/G/1 queue is a good starting point:
\[ E[T] = \frac{\mu + \sigma^2}{\mu - \lambda} \]
where \(\rho = \lambda / \mu\) is the load factor, and \(\sigma^2\) is the variance of service times.

For an M/H 2/1 queue, we need to account for heavy-tailed distributions. The expected excess time \(E[\text{Excess}]\) can be derived using the busy period distribution, which in general involves complex integrals or approximations depending on the specific form of the heavy-tailed distribution.

In practice, one might use simulation techniques or asymptotic approximations to estimate these values. For a detailed calculation:
1. Calculate the load factor \(\rho\).
2. Use the busy period distribution to find \(E[\text{Excess}]\).

```java
// Pseudocode for calculating excess time in M/H 2/1 queue
public class ExcessTimeCalculation {
    double lambda; // Arrival rate
    double mu;     // Service rate
    double sigma2; // Variance of service times
    
    public void calculateExcess() {
        double rho = lambda / mu;
        
        // Pollaczek-Khintchine formula for mean response time (approximation)
        double E_T = 1 + (mu * rho) / (mu - lambda);
        
        // Busy period distribution and excess calculation (complex, use simulation or approximations)
        double E_Excess = busyPeriodDistributionExcess();
        
        System.out.println("Expected excess time: " + E_Excess);
    }
    
    private double busyPeriodDistributionExcess() {
        // Placeholder for complex calculations
        return 1.5; // Example value, needs precise calculation or simulation
    }
}
```

#### M/G/1 Queue and Heavy-Tailed Distributions (continued)
Background context: In an M/G/1 queue with heavy-tailed service times, the Pollaczek-Khintchine formula can be adapted to account for the variability in service times. The excess time \(E[\text{Excess}]\) and waiting time \(E[T_Q]\) are critical metrics.

:p How does one derive the expected excess time \(E[\text{Excess}]\) for a heavy-tailed M/G/1 queue?
??x
Deriving the expected excess time \(E[\text{Excess}]\) in an M/G/1 queue with heavy-tailed service times involves several steps:
1. **Busy Period Distribution**: Calculate the busy period distribution of the system.
2. **Excess Time Calculation**: Use renewal theory to find the expected excess time.

For a heavy-tailed distribution, the key is to account for the tail behavior in the service times. The Pollaczek-Khintchine formula can be adapted as:
\[ E[T] = \frac{\mu + \sigma^2}{\mu - \lambda} \]
where \(\rho = \lambda / \mu\) is the load factor, and \(\sigma^2\) is the variance of service times.

The excess time \(E[\text{Excess}]\) can be derived using the busy period distribution. For a heavy-tailed distribution, one might use asymptotic approximations or simulation techniques to estimate these values accurately.

```java
// Pseudocode for deriving expected excess time in M/G/1 queue with heavy tails
public class HeavyTailedQueue {
    double lambda; // Arrival rate
    double mu;     // Service rate
    double sigma2; // Variance of service times
    
    public void deriveExcessTime() {
        double rho = lambda / mu;
        
        // Pollaczek-Khintchine formula for mean response time (approximation)
        double E_T = 1 + (mu * rho) / (mu - lambda);
        
        // Busy period distribution and excess calculation
        double E_Excess = busyPeriodExcessDistribution();
        
        System.out.println("Expected excess time: " + E_Excess);
    }
    
    private double busyPeriodExcessDistribution() {
        // Placeholder for complex calculations or simulation
        return 1.5; // Example value, needs precise calculation or simulation
    }
}
```

#### Multiple Job Types in M/G/1 Queue (continued)
Background context: In an M/G/1 queue with multiple job types, each type has its own arrival rate and service distribution. The mean response time for each type can be calculated using the Pollaczek-Khintchine formula.

:p How do you calculate the mean response times for different job types in an M/G/1 queue?
??x
To calculate the mean response times for red and blue jobs in an M/G/1 queue, we use the Pollaczek-Khintchine formula:
\[ E[T] = \frac{1 + \rho}{\mu - \lambda} \]
where \(\rho = \lambda / \mu\) is the load factor.

For each job type, we need to determine the arrival rate \(\lambda_j\) and mean service time \(E[S_j]\).

Given:
- Red jobs: Arrival rate \(\lambda_R = 0.25\) jobs/sec, Service size \(E[R] = 1\), Variance \(\sigma^2_R = 1\)
- Blue jobs: Arrival rate \(\lambda_B = 0.5\) jobs/sec, Service size \(E[B] = 0.5\), Variance \(\sigma^2_B = 1\)

The mean response time for each job type can be calculated as follows:

For red jobs:
\[ E[T_R] = \frac{1 + \rho_R}{1 - \lambda_R} \]
where \(\rho_R = \lambda_R / E[R] = 0.25 / 1 = 0.25\).
Thus,
\[ E[T_R] = \frac{1 + 0.25}{1 - 0.25} = \frac{1.25}{0.75} = \frac{5}{3} \approx 1.67 \text{ seconds} \]

For blue jobs:
\[ E[T_B] = \frac{1 + \rho_B}{2 - \lambda_B} \]
where \(\rho_B = \lambda_B / E[B] = 0.5 / 0.5 = 1\).
Thus,
\[ E[T_B] = \frac{1 + 1}{2 - 0.5} = \frac{2}{1.5} = \frac{4}{3} \approx 1.33 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, the mean response time for red jobs is approximately \(1.67\) seconds and for blue jobs, it is approximately \(1.33\) seconds.

```java
// Pseudocode for calculating mean response times in M/G/1 queue with multiple job types
public class MultipleJobTypes {
    double lambda_R; // Arrival rate of red jobs
    double E_R;      // Mean service time of red jobs
    double lambda_B; // Arrival rate of blue jobs
    double E_B;      // Mean service time of blue jobs
    
    public void calculateMeanResponse() {
        double rho_R = lambda_R / E_R;
        double rho_B = lambda_B / E_B;
        
        double ER = 1 + rho_R;
        double EB = 1 + rho_B;
        
        double MR = ER / (E_R - lambda_R);
        double MB = EB / (2 * E_B - lambda_B);
        
        System.out.println("Mean response time for red jobs: " + MR);
        System.out.println("Mean response time for blue jobs: " + MB);
    }
}
```
