#### Network of PS Servers with Probabilistic Routing

In this context, we discuss a network consisting of two M/G/1/PS (Phase-Switching) servers connected in tandem. The system has Poisson outside arrivals and general Coxian service times. The key feature here is that jobs move through phases independently, which allows for the product form solution.

Background context: For such a setup, the probability distribution of the number of jobs at each server can be described as follows:
\[ P\{n \text{jobs at server 1}\} = \frac{\sum_{m=0}^\infty (1-\rho_a)(1-\rho_b) \cdot \rho_a^n \rho_b^m}{\sum_{m=0}^\infty (1 - \rho_a)(1 - \rho_b) \cdot \rho_a^n \rho_b^m} = (1-\rho_a)\rho_a^n \]
Similarly,
\[ P\{m \text{jobs at server 2}\} = (1-\rho_b)\rho_b^m. \]

Thus, the joint probability is:
\[ P\{n \text{ jobs at server 1 and } m \text{ jobs at server 2}\} = \rho_a^n(1-\rho_a)(1-\rho_b)\rho_b^m = P\{n \text{ jobs at server 1}\} \cdot P\{m \text{ jobs at server 2}\}. \]

This implies that the distribution of the number of jobs at each server follows an M/M/1 system.

:p What is the key feature allowing for product form solutions in this network setup?
??x
The key feature is that all jobs are inside the gray bubble (representing the server) at all times and move through phases independently. This independence allows the joint probability to be expressed as a product of individual probabilities.
x??

#### Insensitivity Property

This property states that the distribution of the number of jobs in each queue remains similar regardless of the specific job size distribution, as long as its mean is known.

:p What does insensitivity imply about the job size distribution?
??x
Insensitivity implies that only the mean of the job size distribution affects the system's performance metrics. The exact shape or form of the distribution does not matter; what matters is the average service time.
x??

#### Comparison with FCFS Servers

FCFS (First-Come, First-Served) servers differ fundamentally from PS servers in their behavior and state space.

:p How do FCFS servers behave differently compared to PS servers?
??x
In an FCFS system, only one job can be processed at a time within the server. Other jobs must wait in queue outside the server. This strict queueing discipline restricts job movement significantly.
x??

#### Why Product Form Results Fail for FCFS Servers

The key reason why product form results do not arise with FCFS servers is due to the strict queueing discipline and the restricted state space.

:p Why don’t these nice product form results come up when we have a network of FCFS servers?
??x
These nice product form results fail in FCFS networks because jobs must wait in queues, leading to a more complex state space. The movement of jobs is not independent due to the queueing discipline, which makes it difficult to derive a product form solution.

#### M/BP/1/PS Queue Simulation
Background context: The chapter discusses simulating an M/G/1/FCFS queue with a Bounded Pareto( k, p, α) service time distribution. Here, we need to understand how this changes when using PS (Probabilistic Service) scheduling instead of FCFS.
:p What is expected change in mean response time for the M/BP/1/PS queue under different α values?
??x
When simulating an M/BP/1/PS queue with Bounded Pareto( k, p, α) service times, the mean response time can be significantly affected by the value of α. For a lower α (e.g., 1.5), the service times are more variable and typically longer than for higher α values (e.g., 2.9). Therefore, we expect the mean response time to be higher when α=1.5 compared to when α=2.9.

To figure this out analytically or simulate it:
- Analytically: Use the known results from queueing theory on how different service time distributions affect response times.
- Simulation: Implement a simulation where you generate Bounded Pareto( k, p, α) service times and measure the mean response time for each case.

Here is an example of pseudocode for simulating this:

```java
public class ServiceTimeSimulation {
    private double lambda;
    private double mu1;
    private double mu2;
    private double rho;

    public ServiceTimeSimulation(double lambda, double mu1, double mu2) {
        this.lambda = lambda;
        this.mu1 = mu1;
        this.mu2 = mu2;
        rho = lambda / (mu1 + mu2);
    }

    // Simulate service times and calculate mean response time
    public double simulateMeanResponseTime(double alpha) {
        Random random = new Random();
        List<Double> serviceTimes1 = generateBoundedParetoServiceTimes(alpha, 10000, 10^10, 1.5);
        List<Double> serviceTimes2 = generateBoundedParetoServiceTimes(alpha, 1970, 10^10, 2.9);

        double meanResponseTime1 = calculateMeanResponse(serviceTimes1);
        double meanResponseTime2 = calculateMeanResponse(serviceTimes2);

        return (meanResponseTime1 + meanResponseTime2) / 2;
    }

    private List<Double> generateBoundedParetoServiceTimes(double alpha, int k, long p, double alphaValue) {
        // Generate service times using the Bounded Pareto distribution with given parameters
        // This is a placeholder for actual implementation
    }

    private double calculateMeanResponse(List<Double> serviceTimes) {
        double totalResponseTime = 0.0;
        for (double time : serviceTimes) {
            totalResponseTime += time;
        }
        return totalResponseTime / serviceTimes.size();
    }
}
```

This code simulates the mean response time under different α values, giving you a clear idea of how variability in service times affects performance.

#### Tandem Network of PS Servers
Background context: The chapter discusses the product form solution for tandem networks of PS (Probabilistic Service) servers. The goal is to prove that the proposed πn1,n2,m1,m2 satisfies the local balance equations.
:p How do you verify that a given guess for the limiting probabilities in a tandem network of PS servers satisfies the local balance equations?
??x
To verify that the given guess for the limiting probabilities satisfies the local balance equations, we need to check if it balances at each server and phase. The proposed πn1,n2,m1,m2 is:

\[
π_{n_1, n_2, m_1, m_2} = \binom{n_1 + n_2}{n_1} ρ_1^{n_1}ρ_2^{n_2}/\left(\binom{m_1 + m_2}{m_1}\right) ρ_3^{m_1}ρ_4^{m_2}π_{0, 0, 0, 0}
\]

where \( ρ_1 = \lambda / μ_1 \), \( ρ_2 = λp / μ_2 \), \( ρ_3 = \lambda / μ_3 \), and \( ρ_4 = λq / μ_4 \).

The local balance equations for each server can be checked as follows:

For server 1:
- Balance at the end of phase 1: 
\[
\sum_{n_2, m_1, m_2} π_{0, n_2, m_1, m_2} μ_1 = \sum_{n_1, n_2, m_1, m_2} π_{n_1, n_2, m_1, m_2} λp
\]
- Balance at the end of phase 2:
\[
\sum_{n_1, m_1, m_2} π_{n_1, 0, m_1, m_2} μ_2 = \sum_{n_1, n_2, m_1, m_2} π_{n_1, n_2, m_1, m_2} λq
\]

For server 2:
- Balance at the start of phase 3:
\[
\sum_{n_1, n_2, m_2} π_{n_1, n_2, 0, m_2} μ_3 = \sum_{n_1, n_2, m_1, m_2} π_{n_1, n_2, m_1, m_2} λ
\]
- Balance at the start of phase 4:
\[
\sum_{n_1, n_2, m_1} π_{n_1, n_2, m_1, 0} μ_4 = \sum_{n_1, n_2, m_1, m_2} π_{n_1, n_2, m_1, m_2} λ
\]

By substituting the given π into these equations and simplifying, you can verify that it balances at each step.

#### The Inspection Paradox

Background context: This section introduces the concept of the inspection paradox, which occurs when we observe a system at a random time and this can lead to biased results. In the example provided, buses arrive every 10 minutes on average with exponentially distributed inter-arrival times. If you arrive at a random time, your perceived waiting time might be longer than the average waiting time.

:p What is the inspection paradox, and how is it demonstrated in the bus arrival scenario?
??x
The inspection paradox occurs when observing a system at a random point can lead to biased results. In the bus scenario, because you arrive randomly, you are more likely to arrive during a longer wait period than an average one. This is because there is always a non-zero probability of arriving right after a long inter-arrival time.

```java
// Pseudocode to illustrate the concept
public class BusArrivalScenario {
    private double meanInterArrivalTime = 10; // Exponential distribution with λ=1/10

    public double getRandomWaitingTime() {
        double interArrivalTime = generateExponentialRandomValue(meanInterArrivalTime);
        return interArrivalTime - (Math.random() * interArrivalTime); // Random arrival time within the interval
    }

    private double generateExponentialRandomValue(double mean) {
        // Method to generate exponential random values with given mean
        return -mean * Math.log(1 - Math.random());
    }
}
```

#### M/G/1 Queue

Background context: The M/G/1 queue model consists of a single server and a queue where jobs arrive according to a Poisson process. The service time can be any general distribution, with the mean service time being 1/μ.

:p Define an M/G/1 queue.
??x
An M/G/1 queue is a queuing system with a single server and a queue. Jobs arrive according to a Poisson process with rate λ. Each job has a general (possibly non-Exponential) distribution for its service time, denoted by the random variable S, where E[S] = 1/μ.

```java
// Pseudocode to simulate an M/G/1 Queue
public class MGOneQueueSimulator {
    private double arrivalRate; // λ
    private ServiceTimeDistribution serviceTimeDist; // Generic distribution for service times

    public MGOneQueueSimulator(double arrivalRate, ServiceTimeDistribution dist) {
        this.arrivalRate = arrivalRate;
        this.serviceTimeDist = dist;
    }

    public double simulateSystem() {
        // Simulate the queue based on Poisson arrivals and generic service time distribution
        return 0; // Placeholder for actual simulation logic
    }
}
```

#### Tagged Job Technique

Background context: This technique involves tagging an arbitrary arrival in the system to determine the mean time spent by that job in the queue. The tagged job technique helps derive expressions for mean waiting times and utilization factors.

:p Explain how the tagged job technique works.
??x
The tagged job technique involves tagging a specific arriving job (a "tagged" arrival) and analyzing its behavior through the system. By doing so, we can derive the expected time spent in the queue by the tagged arrival, which is equal to the mean waiting time for all jobs.

Key steps include:
1. Calculate \( E[TQ] \), the mean time in queue.
2. Use the equation: 
\[ E[TQ] = \frac{\rho}{1 - \rho} \cdot E[Se] \]
where \( \rho \) is the traffic intensity (utilization factor), and \( E[Se] \) is the expected remaining service time given that there is a job in service.

```java
// Pseudocode for calculating mean time in queue using tagged job technique
public class TaggedJobAnalysis {
    private double utilizationFactor; // ρ
    private double avgServiceTimeRemaining; // E[Se]

    public double calculateMeanWaitingTime() {
        return utilizationFactor / (1 - utilizationFactor) * avgServiceTimeRemaining;
    }
}
```

#### Mean Time in Queue for M/G/1

Background context: Using the tagged job technique, we can derive a formula for the mean time in queue (waiting time) for an M/G/1 system. This involves breaking down the expectation into components and leveraging the fact that the arrival process is Poisson.

:p Derive the formula for the mean time in queue for an M/G/1 system.
??x
The mean time in queue \( E[TQ] \) for an M/G/1 system can be derived using the tagged job technique. The key steps are:

1. **Expectation Breakdown**: 
\[ E[TQ] = E\left[\frac{N_Q}{\sum_{i=1}^{N_Q} S_i}\right] + E[ \text{unfinished work at server}] \]
2. **Simplification**:
\[ E[TQ] = \mathbb{E}\left[\frac{\mathbb{E}[N_Q]}{\mu}\right] + (P\{\text{server busy}\}) \cdot E[Se] \]
3. **Further Simplification**:
\[ E[TQ] = \frac{\mathbb{E}[N_Q]}{\mu} + \rho \cdot E[Se] \]
4. **Final Expression**:
\[ E[TQ] = \frac{\rho}{1 - \rho} \cdot E[Se] \]

Where \( N_Q \) is the number in queue, \( S_i \) are the service times of jobs in the queue, and \( Se \) is the remaining service time when there is a job in service.

```java
// Pseudocode to calculate mean waiting time for M/G/1 system
public class MGOneQueueWaitingTime {
    private double utilizationFactor; // ρ
    private double avgServiceTimeRemaining; // E[Se]

    public double calculateMeanWaitingTime() {
        return utilizationFactor / (1 - utilizationFactor) * avgServiceTimeRemaining;
    }
}
```

#### M/M/1 Queue Example

Background context: The M/M/1 queue is a special case of the M/G/1 queue where service times are exponentially distributed.

:p Derive the mean time in queue for an M/M/1 system.
??x
For the M/M/1 system, where the service time \( S \) follows an Exponential distribution with mean 1/μ:

- The expected remaining service time \( E[Se] = \frac{1}{\mu} \).
- Using the formula derived earlier:
\[ E[TQ] = \frac{\rho}{1 - \rho} \cdot E[Se] = \frac{\rho}{1 - \rho} \cdot \frac{1}{\mu} \]

Thus, for an M/M/1 system:
\[ E[TQ] = \frac{\lambda / \mu}{1 - \lambda / \mu} \cdot \frac{1}{\mu} = \frac{\lambda}{\mu (1 - \lambda / \mu)} \]

```java
// Pseudocode to calculate mean waiting time for M/M/1 system
public class MMOneQueueWaitingTime {
    private double arrivalRate; // λ
    private double serviceRate; // μ

    public double calculateMeanWaitingTime() {
        double utilizationFactor = arrivalRate / serviceRate;
        return utilizationFactor / (1 - utilizationFactor) * (1 / serviceRate);
    }
}
```
x??

#### M/D/1 Queue Example

Background context: The M/D/1 queue is another special case of the M/G/1 where service times are deterministic and equal to 1/μ.

:p Derive the mean time in queue for an M/D/1 system.
??x
For the M/D/1 system, where the service time \( S \) is deterministic with mean 1/μ:

- The expected remaining service time \( E[Se] = \frac{1}{2\mu} \), because the remaining service time of a job in service is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1/μ.
- Using the formula derived earlier:
\[ E[TQ] = \frac{\rho}{1 - \rho} \cdot E[Se] = \frac{\rho}{1 - \rho} \cdot \frac{1}{2\mu} \]

Thus, for an M/D/1 system:
\[ E[TQ] = \frac{\lambda / \mu}{1 - \lambda / \mu} \cdot \frac{1}{2\mu} \]

```java
// Pseudocode to calculate mean waiting time for M/D/1 system
public class MDOneQueueWaitingTime {
    private double arrivalRate; // λ
    private double serviceRate; // μ

    public double calculateMeanWaitingTime() {
        double utilizationFactor = arrivalRate / serviceRate;
        return (utilizationFactor / (1 - utilizationFactor)) * (1 / (2 * serviceRate));
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### M/Ek/1 Queue Example

Background context: The M/Ek/1 queue is a special case where the service time follows an Erlang-k distribution, with each stage having an Exponential distribution with mean 1/μ.

:p Derive the mean time in queue for an M/Ek/1 system.
??x
For the M/Ek/1 system, where the service time \( S \) is Erlang-k distributed:

- The expected remaining service time \( E[Se] = \frac{k}{\mu k - \lambda} \), because the remaining service time of a job in service with an Erlang-k distribution can be derived from its properties.
- Using the formula derived earlier:
\[ E[TQ] = \frac{\rho}{1 - \rho} \cdot E[Se] = \frac{\rho}{1 - \rho} \cdot \frac{k}{\mu k - \lambda} \]

Thus, for an M/Ek/1 system:
\[ E[TQ] = \frac{\lambda / (\mu k)}{1 - \lambda / (\mu k)} \cdot \frac{k}{\mu k - \lambda} \]

```java
// Pseudocode to calculate mean waiting time for M/Ek/1 system
public class MEKOneQueueWaitingTime {
    private double arrivalRate; // λ
    private double serviceRate; // μ
    private int stages; // k

    public double calculateMeanWaitingTime() {
        double utilizationFactor = arrivalRate / (serviceRate * stages);
        return (utilizationFactor / (1 - utilizationFactor)) * (stages / (stages * serviceRate - arrivalRate));
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### M/G/1 Utilization and Mean Waiting Time

Background context: The traffic intensity or utilization factor \( \rho \) is defined as the ratio of the arrival rate to the service rate. For an M/G/1 system, the mean waiting time can be derived using this factor.

:p Derive the expression for the mean waiting time in terms of the utilization factor \( \rho \).
??x
The mean waiting time \( E[TQ] \) in an M/G/1 system can be expressed in terms of the traffic intensity (utilization factor) \( \rho \):

\[ E[TQ] = \frac{\rho}{(1 - \rho)} \cdot E[Se] \]

Where:
- \( \rho = \frac{\lambda}{\mu} \)
- \( E[Se] \) is the expected remaining service time given that there is a job in service.

This formula captures how the waiting time increases as the system utilization approaches 1, indicating congestion.

```java
// Pseudocode to calculate mean waiting time for M/G/1 system using ρ
public class MGOneQueueUtilization {
    private double utilizationFactor; // ρ

    public double calculateMeanWaitingTime() {
        return (utilizationFactor / (1 - utilizationFactor)) * 1.0; // Placeholder value for E[Se]
    }
}
```
x??

#### General Service Time Distributions

Background context: The M/G/1 system allows for any general distribution of service times, with the key being that it is stationary and ergodic.

:p Explain why the M/G/1 model can handle any general service time distribution.
??x
The M/G/1 model can handle any general service time distribution because:
- It assumes a single server and Poisson arrival process.
- The system's state (number of jobs in the queue) is defined by the current number of jobs, which includes both those being served and those waiting.
- By defining \( E[Se] \), the expected remaining service time for a job given that there is one in service, we can generalize the formula for any distribution.

This flexibility allows M/G/1 to model systems with various service time distributions such as Exponential (M/M/1), Deterministic (M/D/1), and Erlang-k (M/Ek/1).

```java
// Pseudocode to handle general service time distributions in M/G/1 system
public class MGOneQueueServiceTime {
    private double utilizationFactor; // ρ

    public double calculateMeanWaitingTime() {
        return (utilizationFactor / (1 - utilizationFactor)) * 1.0; // Placeholder value for E[Se]
    }
}
```

#### Traffic Intensity \( \rho \)

Background context: The traffic intensity or utilization factor \( \rho \) is a key parameter in queuing theory, representing the ratio of the arrival rate to the service rate.

:p Define and explain the concept of traffic intensity \( \rho \).
??x
Traffic intensity (or utilization factor) \( \rho \) is defined as the ratio of the arrival rate \( \lambda \) to the service rate \( \mu \):

\[ \rho = \frac{\lambda}{\mu} \]

This parameter indicates how busy the server is. When \( \rho < 1 \), the system can handle the load without infinite queues, and when \( \rho > 1 \), it leads to queue buildup.

```java
// Pseudocode to calculate traffic intensity
public class TrafficIntensity {
    private double arrivalRate; // λ
    private double serviceRate; // μ

    public double calculateTrafficIntensity() {
        return arrivalRate / serviceRate;
    }
}
```
