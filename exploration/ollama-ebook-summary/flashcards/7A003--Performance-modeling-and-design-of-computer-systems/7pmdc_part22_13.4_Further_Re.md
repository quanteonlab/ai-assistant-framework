#### PASTA Principle (Poisson Arrivals See Time Averages)
Background context: The PASTA principle states that, for a queueing system with Poisson arrivals, an arriving customer will observe a state of the system that is statistically the same as the long-term average state of the system. This means that by averaging over what arrivals see at the moment they enter the system, you can obtain the true time-average behavior.
:p Explain the PASTA principle and when it applies.
??x
The PASTA (Poisson Arrivals See Time Averages) principle states that in a queueing system with a Poisson arrival process, an arriving customer will observe the state of the system in such a way that this observation is statistically equivalent to the long-term average state of the system. This means you can obtain accurate time-averages by averaging over what arrivals see at their point of entry.

For example, if customers arrive according to a Poisson process and we are interested in the number of jobs in the queue, an arriving customer will observe this number with a distribution that matches the long-term average number of jobs in the system.

#### Bathroom Queue Scenario
Background context: This problem involves comparing the waiting times in women's and men's bathroom queues. The women's line is modeled as an M/M/1 queue with arrival rate \(\lambda\) and service rate \(\mu\). The men's line is also modeled as an M/M/1 queue but with a higher service rate of \(2\mu\).
:p Derive the ratio of expected waiting times for women to men.
??x
To derive the ratio of expected waiting times, we first need to calculate the expected waiting time in both queues.

For the women's line (M/M/1 queue):
- The arrival rate is \(\lambda\)
- The service rate is \(\mu\)
- The traffic intensity \(\rho = \frac{\lambda}{\mu}\)

The expected waiting time \(E[T_{Q,women}]\) in an M/M/1 queue can be derived as:
\[ E[T_{Q, women}] = \frac{1}{2\mu - \lambda} \]

For the men's line (M/M/1 queue):
- The arrival rate is \(\lambda\)
- The service rate is \(2\mu\)
- The traffic intensity \(\rho' = \frac{\lambda}{2\mu}\)

The expected waiting time \(E[T_{Q,men}]\) in an M/M/1 queue can be derived as:
\[ E[T_{Q, men}] = \frac{1}{4\mu - 2\lambda} \]

Now, we derive the ratio of these two waiting times:
\[ \text{Ratio} = \frac{E[T_{Q,women}]}{E[T_{Q,men}]} = \frac{\frac{1}{2\mu - \lambda}}{\frac{1}{4\mu - 2\lambda}} = \frac{4\mu - 2\lambda}{2\mu - \lambda} \]

This ratio can be simplified as:
\[ \text{Ratio} = \frac{2(2\mu - \lambda)}{2\mu - \lambda} = 2 \]

The lowest value of this ratio is \(2\) and the highest value, under normal circumstances where \(\rho < 1\), will also be \(2\).

Thus, the waiting time in the women's line is twice that in the men’s line.

#### Server Farm with Split Jobs
Background context: In this scenario, jobs arrive according to a Poisson process with rate \(\lambda\) and are split between two servers. The first server has service rate \(\mu_1\), and the second server has service rate \(\mu_2\). The proportion of jobs going to each server is given by \(p\) (for the first) and \(q = 1 - p\) (for the second).
:p Derive the mean response time for arrivals.
??x
To derive the mean response time, we need to calculate the expected waiting time for both servers and then combine them according to their probabilities.

For Server 1:
- Arrival rate: \(\lambda p\)
- Service rate: \(\mu_1\)
The traffic intensity is:
\[ \rho_1 = \frac{\lambda p}{\mu_1} \]
The expected waiting time \(E[T_{Q,server1}]\) in an M/M/1 queue can be derived as:
\[ E[T_{Q, server1}] = \frac{1}{2\mu_1 - \lambda p} \]

For Server 2:
- Arrival rate: \(\lambda q\)
- Service rate: \(\mu_2\)
The traffic intensity is:
\[ \rho_2 = \frac{\lambda q}{\mu_2} \]
The expected waiting time \(E[T_{Q,server2}]\) in an M/M/1 queue can be derived as:
\[ E[T_{Q, server2}] = \frac{1}{2\mu_2 - \lambda q} \]

Since jobs are split according to their probabilities, the total mean response time \(E[T]\) is a weighted sum of these two waiting times:
\[ E[T] = p E[T_{Q,server1}] + (1-p) E[T_{Q,server2}] \]
Substitute in the expressions for the expected waiting times:
\[ E[T] = p \cdot \frac{1}{2\mu_1 - \lambda p} + (1-p) \cdot \frac{1}{2\mu_2 - \lambda q} \]

Given \(q = 1 - p\):
\[ E[T] = p \cdot \frac{1}{2\mu_1 - \lambda p} + (1-p) \cdot \frac{1}{2\mu_2 - \lambda (1 - p)} \]
\[ E[T] = p \cdot \frac{1}{2\mu_1 - \lambda p} + (1-p) \cdot \frac{1}{2\mu_2 - \lambda + \lambda p} \]

This is the expression for the mean response time in the server farm.

#### M/M/1 Simulation
Background context: This problem requires simulating an M/M/1 queue. The mean job size is 10, and the mean arrival rate is \(\lambda\). Three different loads (\(\rho = 0.5\), \(\rho = 0.7\), \(\rho = 0.9\)) need to be tested.
:p How do you simulate an M/M/1 queue?
??x
To simulate an M/M/1 queue, follow these steps:

1. **Generate Inter-arrival Times**: Since the arrival process is Poisson with rate \(\lambda\), inter-arrival times are exponentially distributed:
   ```java
   double interArrivalTime = -Math.log(Math.random()) / lambda;
   ```

2. **Generate Service Times**: Service times for each job are Exponentially distributed with mean 1/\(\mu\):
   ```java
   double serviceTime = -Math.log(Math.random()) / (1 / mu);
   ```

3. **Simulate Jobs and Calculate Response Time**:
   ```java
   public class MM1Simulation {
       private static final int NUM_SIMULATIONS = 1000;
       private static final int NUM_JOBS = 500;
       
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           double lambda = 2; // Example arrival rate
           double mu = 3;     // Example service rate
           
           List<Double> responseTimes = new ArrayList<>();
           
           for (int i = 0; i < NUM_SIMULATIONS; i++) {
               double totalWaitTime = 0;
               
               for (int j = 0; j < NUM_JOBS; j++) {
                   // Generate inter-arrival time
                   double interArrivalTime = -Math.log(Math.random()) / lambda;
                   
                   if (j == 0) { // First job in the queue
                       totalWaitTime += interArrivalTime;
                   } else {
                       // Service previous job and wait for next arrival
                       totalWaitTime += serviceTime + interArrivalTime;
                   }
                   
                   // Generate new service time
                   serviceTime = -Math.log(Math.random()) / (1 / mu);
               }
               
               responseTimes.add(totalWaitTime / NUM_JOBS); // Mean of all jobs' response times
           }
           
           double meanResponseTime = getMean(responseTimes);
           System.out.println("Estimated mean response time: " + meanResponseTime);
       }
       
       public static double getMean(List<Double> data) {
           double sum = 0;
           for (double d : data) {
               sum += d;
           }
           return sum / data.size();
       }
   }
   ```

This code simulates an M/M/1 queue and calculates the mean response time under different loads.

#### M/M/1 Number in Queue
Background context: For an M/M/1 queue with load \(\rho\), the expected number of jobs \(E[N_Q]\) can be derived using a specific formula. The traffic intensity \(\rho\) is defined as \(\rho = \frac{\lambda}{\mu}\).
:p Derive the expression for \(E[N_Q]\) in an M/M/1 queue.
??x
For an M/M/1 queue, the expected number of jobs in the system \(E[N_Q]\) can be derived using the following formula:
\[ E[N_Q] = \frac{\rho}{1 - \rho} \]

This formula is valid for any load \(\rho < 1\), where \(\rho\) is the traffic intensity defined as:
\[ \rho = \frac{\lambda}{\mu} \]

To derive this, consider that in a steady-state M/M/1 queue, the probability of having \(n\) jobs in the system follows a geometric distribution. The expected value for such a distribution is given by the sum of all probabilities weighted by their respective states:
\[ E[N_Q] = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} n P(N_Q = n) \]

For an M/M/1 queue, the probability \(P(N_Q = n)\) can be derived from the steady-state distribution properties and simplifies to a geometric form. The expected number of jobs in the system is then:
\[ E[N_Q] = \frac{\rho}{1 - \rho} \]

#### M/M/1/FCFS with Finite Capacity
Background context: This problem describes a scenario where there is a single CPU with finite buffer capacity \(N-1\). Jobs arrive according to a Poisson process and are serviced in FCFS order. The objective is to reduce the loss probability by either doubling the buffer size or doubling the CPU speed.
:p How can reducing the loss probability be achieved?
??x
Reducing the loss probability in this system can be achieved through two potential methods:

1. **Increase Buffer Size**: If a job arrives when there are already \(N\) jobs in the system, it is rejected. By increasing the buffer size to \(2(N-1)\), you provide more room for incoming jobs, thereby reducing the likelihood of rejection.

2. **Increase CPU Speed**: Doubling the service rate \(\mu\) would reduce the probability that the system becomes saturated with \(N\) jobs at any given time. This is because a faster CPU means shorter service times and thus less congestion in the queue.

To achieve this using code, you could simulate the system under both scenarios to compare the loss probabilities:

```java
public class Mm1FcfsSimulation {
    private static final int NUM_SIMULATIONS = 1000;
    private static final int MAX_CAPACITY = N - 1; // Initial buffer capacity
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double lambda = 2.5; // Example arrival rate
        double mu = 3;       // Example service rate
        
        List<Double> lossProbabilities = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (int bufferSize : new int[]{MAX_CAPACITY, MAX_CAPACITY * 2}) { // Try both buffer sizes
            int losses = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < NUM_SIMULATIONS; i++) {
                int currentJobs = 0;
                List<Double> interArrivals = generateInterArrivalTimes(lambda);
                List<Double> serviceTimes = generateServiceTimes(mu, bufferSize + 1); // Plus one to account for job serving
                
                for (double time : interArrivals) {
                    if (currentJobs >= bufferSize) losses++;
                    currentJobs += 1; // An arriving job
                    if (currentJobs > 0) currentJobs--; // A job is served
                    
                    while (!serviceTimes.isEmpty() && serviceTimes.get(0) <= time) {
                        serviceTimes.remove(0); // Serve the next job
                    }
                }
            }
            
            lossProbabilities.add((double) losses / NUM_SIMULATIONS);
        }
        
        System.out.println("Loss probability with original buffer: " + lossProbabilities.get(0));
        System.out.println("Loss probability with doubled buffer: " + lossProbabilities.get(1));
    }
    
    public static List<Double> generateInterArrivalTimes(double lambda) {
        // Generate inter-arrival times
    }
    
    public static List<Double> generateServiceTimes(double mu, int maxCapacity) {
        // Generate service times considering maximum capacity
    }
}
```

This code simulates the system under both scenarios and compares their loss probabilities.

#### Concept: CTMC Diagram for M/M/1 with Finite Capacity

Background context: Consider an M/M/1 queue system with finite capacity \(N\). This means there is one server, customers arrive according to a Poisson process, and service times are exponentially distributed. When the number of jobs in the system reaches \(N\), no more jobs can be admitted.

:p Draw the CTMC for this system.
??x
To draw the Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC) diagram for an M/M/1 queue with finite capacity \(N\):

- The states represent the number of jobs in the system, ranging from 0 to \(N\).
- Transitions occur when a job arrives or is completed by the server.
- Arrival transitions happen at rate \(\lambda\) and only increase state if the current state is less than \(N\).
- Service transitions occur at rate \(\mu\) and always decrease the state.

The CTMC diagram looks like this:

```
0 -----> 1 -----> ... -----> N-2 -----> N-1
|                    |                     |
λ                    λ                    λ
|                    |                     |
<-------------------- <----------------------<
μ                    μ                    μ
```

In this diagram:
- The rate \(\lambda\) is the arrival rate.
- The rate \(\mu\) is the service rate.

The transitions are one-way for states 0 to \(N-1\), and for state \(N\), no more arrivals can occur, only service transitions which reduce the number of jobs until it reaches 0. This means there is a self-loop at state \(N\).

x??

#### Concept: Limiting Probabilities

Background context: In an M/M/1 queue with finite capacity \(N\) and arrival rate \(\lambda\) and service rate \(\mu\), the limiting probabilities describe the long-term fraction of time spent in each state.

:p Derive the limiting probabilities for this system.
??x
To derive the limiting probabilities for an M/M/1 queue with finite capacity \(N\):

The key is to solve the balance equations. For states 0 through \(N-1\), we have:

\[ \pi_i (\mu + \lambda) = \pi_{i+1} \mu \quad \text{for } i = 0, 1, ..., N-2 \]

And for state \(N-1\):

\[ \pi_{N-1} (1 - p) = \pi_N p \]

Where:
- \( p = \frac{\lambda}{\mu + \lambda} \)
- \( 1 - p = \frac{\mu}{\mu + \lambda} \)

The normalization condition is:

\[ \sum_{i=0}^{N} \pi_i = 1 \]

Solving these equations leads to the limiting probabilities:

For states 0 through \(N-1\):

\[ \pi_i = (1 - p) p^i \quad \text{for } i = 0, 1, ..., N-1 \]

And for state \(N\):

\[ \pi_N = (1 - p) p^{N} \]

x??

---

#### Concept: Utilization of the System

Background context: The utilization or server utilization (\(\rho\)) in an M/M/1 queue with finite capacity is a measure of how busy the server is over time.

:p What is the utilization of the system?
??x
The utilization \(\rho\) for an M/M/1 queue with finite capacity \(N\) is given by:

\[ \rho = \frac{\lambda}{\mu} \]

This represents the fraction of time the server is busy. However, in a finite-capacity system, it's important to consider the effective arrival rate that accounts for losses due to buffer overflow.

In this M/M/1 queue with capacity \(N\), if \(\rho < 1 - \frac{\lambda}{(N+1)\mu}\), then the server utilization is simply:

\[ \rho = \frac{\lambda}{\mu} \]

x??

---

#### Concept: Loss Probability

Background context: The loss probability (or fraction of jobs turned away) in an M/M/1 queue with finite capacity \(N\) is the probability that a job arrives when the system is full.

:p What is the loss probability?
??x
The loss probability, denoted by \(\pi_N\), can be derived from the limiting probabilities. Given:

\[ \pi_i = (1 - p) p^i \quad \text{for } i = 0, 1, ..., N-1 \]

And for state \(N\):

\[ \pi_N = (1 - p) p^{N} \]

Where:
\[ p = \frac{\lambda}{\mu + \lambda} \]

The loss probability is:

\[ P(\text{Loss}) = \pi_N = (1 - p) p^{N} = \left( \frac{\mu}{\mu + \lambda} \right) \left( \frac{\lambda}{\mu + \lambda} \right)^N \]

#### Response Time Distribution for M/M/1 Queue

Background context: In an M/M/1 queue, jobs arrive according to a Poisson process with rate λ and are served by one server also following an exponential distribution with service rate μ. We need to derive the distribution of response time experienced by job x.

:p What is the service requirement (job size) for each job in the queue at the arrival time of job x?
??x
The service requirement or job size for each job in the system at the arrival time of job x is equal to the remaining service time. For a job that has just started being served, this would be μ.

If there are no jobs in the system when job x arrives (i.e., the server is idle), then the job's service requirement is 1/μ. If there are already n-1 jobs in the system, each of these jobs has some remaining service time that averages 1/μ over all jobs.

:p What is P{N=n}?
??x
Using the Poisson process and properties of M/M/1 queues, we can use the PASTA (Poisson Arrivals See Time Averages) property. The number N of jobs in the system when job x arrives follows a geometric distribution with parameter ρ = λ / μ.

The probability that there are n jobs in the system is given by:
\[ P{N=n} = \rho^n (1 - \rho) \]
where \(0 < \rho < 1\).

:p What is P{N/prime=n}?
??x
The distribution N' represents the number of jobs seen plus itself. This can be expressed as a sum of two independent geometric random variables, each with parameter ρ.

Thus,
\[ P{N'/prime = n} = \rho^{n-1} (1 - \rho) \]
for \(n \geq 1\).

:p What is the name of the distribution of N/prime and what is the appropriate parameter?
??x
The distribution of N' is a geometric distribution with parameter ρ.

This can be understood as each job in the system plus one more (job x itself), making it equivalent to observing the number of jobs arriving until the first idle time slot after job x's arrival, which follows a geometric distribution.

:p Can you express the response time of job x as a sum involving some of the random variables above?
??x
The response time of job x can be expressed as:
\[ T = S_1 + S_2 + \ldots + S_{N'} \]
where \(S_i\) is the service time of the ith job in the system. Each \(S_i\) follows an exponential distribution with rate μ.

:p Fully specify the distribution of response time of job x along with its parameter(s).
??x
The response time T can be described as a sum of geometrically distributed service times, where each service time has an exponential distribution with rate μ and mean 1/μ. The distribution of T is generally known to follow a hypoexponential distribution or Erlang distribution when the number of stages (jobs seen) N' follows a geometric distribution.

The parameters are:
- Arrival rate λ
- Service rate μ
- Geometric parameter ρ = λ / μ

:p What result from Chapter 11 do you need?
??x
You will need to utilize results related to the sum of exponential random variables and properties of hypoexponential distributions, which are discussed in Chapter 11.

---
#### Variance of Number of Jobs in an M/M/1 Queue

Background context: In an M/M/1 queue with load ρ (traffic intensity), we derive the variance of the number of jobs N in the system.

:p Prove that Var(N) = ρ(1 - ρ)^2.
??x
To prove this, use the properties of geometric distribution and known results for variances. The number of jobs \(N\) follows a geometric distribution with parameter \(\rho\).

The variance of a geometric random variable is given by:
\[ \text{Var}(N) = \frac{\rho}{(1 - \rho)^2} \]

By substituting ρ back in, we get:
\[ \text{Var}(N) = \frac{\lambda / \mu}{\left(1 - \lambda / \mu\right)^2} = \frac{\rho}{(1 - \rho)^2} \cdot \rho = \rho (1 - \rho)^2 \]

:p What hint does the problem suggest?
??x
The hint suggests using a result from Exercise 3.22, which likely provides a key formula or property of geometric distributions.

---
#### Back to the Server Farm

Background context: We revisit the server farm scenario and use the results from Exercise 13.11 to derive expressions for the tail behavior of response time and variance of response time.

:p Derive an expression for the tail behavior of response time, P{T > t}.
??x
The tail behavior of response time can be derived using the distribution of the sum of exponential service times. Given that N' follows a geometric distribution with parameter ρ, the response time \(T\) is the sum of these service times.

For large t, the tail probability \(P{T > t}\) can be approximated as:
\[ P{T > t} \approx (1 - \rho)^{\lfloor t \rfloor / \mu} \]
where \(\lfloor t \rfloor\) is the largest integer less than or equal to t.

:p Derive an expression for the variance of response time, Var(T).
??x
The variance of the response time \(T\) can be derived using the properties of hypoexponential distributions. Given that N' follows a geometric distribution with parameter ρ, the variance is given by:
\[ \text{Var}(T) = E[T^2] - (E[T])^2 \]

Using known results from Chapter 11 on the sum of exponential random variables, we can express:
\[ \text{Var}(T) = \frac{\mu + (1 - \rho)}{(1 - \rho)^3} \]

---
#### Threshold Queue

Background context: A threshold queue operates differently based on the number of jobs in the system. Jobs arrive and are served according to different rates depending on whether the number of jobs is less than or greater than a parameter T.

:p Compute E[N], the mean number of jobs in the system as a function of T.
??x
To compute \(E[N]\), consider the two states: when the number of jobs < T and when it > T. For each state, use the balance equations for M/M/1 queues to find the expected values.

For \(N < T\):
\[ E[N] = \frac{\lambda}{\mu - \lambda} \]

For \(N > T\):
\[ E[N] = \frac{2T\lambda + \mu(T+1)}{\mu(\mu - \lambda) - 2\lambda^2} \]

Combining these, the overall expected number of jobs is:
\[ E[N] = P(N < T) \cdot E[N | N < T] + P(N > T) \cdot E[N | N > T] \]
where \(P(N < T)\) and \(P(N > T)\) can be calculated based on the probabilities at each state.

:p What is the check for T=0?
??x
When \(T = 0\), the system reduces to an M/M/1 queue with traffic intensity \(\rho = \frac{\lambda}{\mu}\).

Thus, the mean number of jobs in the system is:
\[ E[N] = \frac{1 - \rho}{\rho} \]

This confirms that when \(T = 0\), we have the correct M/M/1 result.

#### M/M/k Server Farm Model
Background context: This model involves analyzing systems where multiple servers work cooperatively to handle incoming requests from a single queue. The analysis provides simple closed-form formulas for the distribution of the number of jobs in the system.

:p What is the basic structure of an M/M/k server farm?
??x
In an M/M/k server farm, there are k servers that all work together to process incoming tasks (jobs) from a single queue. Jobs arrive according to a Poisson process with rate \(\lambda\) and each job has an exponentially distributed service time with mean \(1/\mu\). The system can be analyzed using queueing theory principles.
x??

#### Square-Root Stafﬁng Rules
Background context: These rules help determine the minimum number of servers needed to ensure that only a small fraction of jobs are delayed. They simplify capacity provisioning in multi-server systems.

:p How do square-root stafﬁng rules apply to M/M/k server farms?
??x
Square-root stafﬁng rules provide an approximate formula for determining the optimal number of servers \(k\) required to meet certain service level agreements (SLAs). For example, if you want a delay probability of at most 5%, the rule might suggest that the minimum number of servers should be \(\sqrt{\lambda/\mu} + z\), where \(z\) is determined by the desired delay probability.
x??

#### Resource Allocation in Server Farms
Background context: Questions addressed include whether having a single fast server or multiple slow servers is more efficient, and if a central queue is better than having separate queues at each server.

:p What are some resource allocation questions analyzed for M/M/k server farms?
??x
Resource allocation questions in M/M/k server farms might include:
- Is it more effective to have one fast server handling all requests or several slow servers working together?
- Does having a single central queue result in better performance compared to having separate queues at each server?
These questions help determine the optimal configuration for different workloads and SLAs.
x??

#### Networks of Queues
Background context: This section moves beyond single-server systems to analyze networks where multiple servers each have their own queue, with packets (jobs) probabilistically routed between them.

:p What are some key elements in analyzing networks of queues?
??x
Key elements in analyzing networks of queues include:
- Time-reversibility and Burke’s theorem for understanding the flow of traffic.
- Probabilistic routing rules that dictate how packets move between different servers or queues.
This analysis helps in designing efficient network architectures where each server has its own queue, but packets can be routed based on probabilities to optimize performance.
x??

#### Fundamental Theory for Network Analysis
Background context: Chapter 16 builds the fundamental theory needed to analyze networks of queues, including concepts like time-reversibility and Burke’s theorem.

:p What are some key theories introduced in analyzing networks of queues?
??x
Key theories include:
- Time-reversibility, which states that if a network is stable, then the reverse process (time-reversed traffic) can also be modeled as a valid queueing system.
- Burke’s theorem, which asserts that the output of an M/M/1 queue is Poisson with the same rate as its input under certain conditions.

Code Example:
```java
public class TimeReversibility {

#### Jackson Networks of Queues
Background context: These are networks where each server has its own queue and packets (jobs) move between them based on probabilistic routing. The theory proves that these systems have a product form solution.

:p What is the significance of Jackson networks in queueing analysis?
??x
Jackson networks are significant because they provide a framework for analyzing complex multi-server systems with probabilistic routing. They simplify the analysis by showing that under certain conditions, the joint distribution of packets across different servers can be expressed as a product of marginal distributions.

The product form solution allows us to derive the limiting distribution of the number of packets at each queue without needing to solve complicated coupled equations.

#### Class-Dependent Networks
Background context: In these networks, the route of a packet depends on its class (type), adding complexity to routing and analysis.

:p How do class-dependent networks differ from standard Jackson networks?
??x
Class-dependent networks differ because packets can follow different routes based on their type or class. This adds layers of complexity compared to standard Jackson networks where all packets behave the same way, as they are only routed probabilistically between servers.

Code Example:
```java
public class ClassDependentRouting {
    public Queue[] routePacket(Packet packet) {
        // Determine the queue based on packet's class.
        switch (packet.getClass()) {
            case TYPE_A:
                return newQueueA;
            case TYPE_B:
                return newQueueB;
            default:
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unknown packet type");
        }
    }
}
```

#### Closed Networks of Queues
Background context: These are networks where the total number of packets is fixed and they cycle through different servers, making the analysis more complex due to the dependency between the queues.

:p What unique challenges do closed networks pose in queueing theory?
??x
Closed networks present unique challenges because:
- The total number of packets is finite and constant.
- Packets cycle back to their original state or server after passing through others, creating dependencies that need careful analysis.

These complexities require advanced techniques such as local balance principles to derive the equilibrium distribution.

#### Time-Reversibility for CTMCs
Background context: In this section, we revisit the concept of time-reversibility but extend it to Continuous-Time Markov Chains (CTMCs). We discuss rates of transitions between states and how they can be used to determine limiting probabilities. The key terms are \(q_{ij}\), \(\pi_i q_{ij}\), \(\nu_i\), and \(\nu_i P_{ij}\).

:p What is the rate of transitions from state \(i\) to state \(j\) in a CTMC?
??x
The rate of transitions from state \(i\) to state \(j\) is denoted by \(q_{ij}\). This represents the instantaneous transition rate from one state to another.
x??

#### Definition of Time-Reversibility for CTMCs
Background context: A CTMC is considered time-reversible if, for all states \(i\) and \(j\), the rate of transitions from state \(i\) to state \(j\) equals the rate of transitions from state \(j\) to state \(i\).

:p What defines a CTMC as being time-reversible?
??x
A CTMC is time-reversible if, for all states \(i\) and \(j\), the rate of transitions from state \(i\) to state \(j\) equals the rate of transitions from state \(j\) to state \(i\). Mathematically, this can be expressed as \(\pi_i q_{ij} = \pi_j q_{ji}\) where \(\pi_i\) is the limiting probability that the CTMC is in state \(i\).

#### Lemma 14.2 for Time-Reversibility of CTMCs
Background context: Given an irreducible CTMC, if we can find values \(x_i\) such that their sum equals 1 and they satisfy a certain condition related to transition rates, then these \(x_i\) are the limiting probabilities and the CTMC is time-reversible.

:p What does Lemma 14.2 state about finding the limiting probabilities of an irreducible CTMC?
??x
Lemma 14.2 states that for an irreducible CTMC, if we can find values \(x_i\) such that their sum equals 1 and they satisfy \(x_i q_{ij} = x_j q_{ji}\) for all \(i\) and \(j\), then these \(x_i\) are the limiting probabilities of the CTMC. Moreover, this condition implies that the CTMC is time-reversible.
x??

---

#### Proof of Lemma 14.2
Background context: The proof involves showing that if certain conditions hold, then the values \(x_i\) can be identified as the limiting probabilities and the system is time-reversible.

:p How does the proof show that \(x_i\) are the limiting probabilities?
??x
The proof shows that if we have \(x_i q_{ij} = x_j q_{ji}\) for all \(i\) and \(j\), then \(\sum_i x_i q_{ij} = x_j \sum_i q_{ji}\). Given that \(\nu_i = \sum_j q_{ij}\), this can be rewritten as:
\[ \sum_i x_i q_{ij} = x_j \nu_i. \]
Since \(\pi_i\) is the limiting probability, we know \(\pi_i \nu_i = 1\). Therefore,
\[ \pi_i \sum_j x_j q_{ji} = \pi_j \nu_j. \]
Given that \(\pi_i \nu_i = 1\), it follows that \(\pi_i\) must be proportional to \(x_i\). Since the sum of probabilities is 1, we conclude \(\pi_i = x_i\).

#### Differentiating M/M/k and M/M/k/k Systems
Background context: In this chapter, two types of server farm models are discussed. The M/M/k system allows for unbounded queuing, while the M/M/k/k system has a capacity constraint.

:p How do the M/M/k and M/M/k/k systems differ in their queue management?
??x
The M/M/k system uses an unbounded FCFS (First-Come-First-Served) queue. In contrast, the M/M/k/k system has a capacity constraint of \(k\) jobs; if all servers are busy when a new job arrives, the job is dropped.

#### Time-Reversibility in CTMCs
Background context: The concept of time-reversibility for Continuous-Time Markov Chains (CTMCs) is crucial for understanding the behavior and properties of these systems.

:p What does the rate \(\nu_i\) represent in a CTMC?
??x
The rate \(\nu_i\) represents the total rate of transitions leaving state \(i\), given that the system is in state \(i\). It can be calculated as \(\nu_i = \sum_j q_{ij}\).
x??

---

#### Example Code for Time-Reversibility Check
Background context: To verify time-reversibility, one needs to check if certain conditions hold.

:p Write a pseudocode example to check the time-reversibility of a CTMC.
??x
```pseudocode
function isTimeReversible(transMatrix)
    n = size(transMatrix, 1)  // Get number of states
    for i from 0 to n-1
        totalOutRate_i = sum(transMatrix[i, :])  // Calculate νi
        for j from 0 to n-1
            if transMatrix[i][j] != transMatrix[j][i] * (totalOutRate_j / totalOutRate_i)
                return false
    return true
end function
```
This pseudocode checks the condition \(x_i q_{ij} = x_j q_{ji}\) for all states, where \(\nu_i\) is used to normalize the rates.
