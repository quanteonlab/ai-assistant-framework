#### Overview of Phase-Type Distributions and Networks

Background context: In Chapter 21, we learned about phase-type (PH) distributions as a method to approximate non-Exponential workload distributions. PH distributions can match several moments of the actual distribution, allowing us to model complex systems using Markov chains.

:p What are PH distributions used for in system analysis?
??x
PH distributions are used to model non-Exponential workloads by matching the first few moments of real-world data. This allows for more accurate modeling and easier analysis via matrix-analytic methods.

#### BCMP Theorem Overview

Background context: The BCMP theorem (Baskett, Chandy, Muntz, and Palacios-Gomez) in 1975 provided a broad classification of networks with product form solutions. This includes both FCFS and PS server disciplines.

:p What is the significance of the BCMP theorem?
??x
The BCMP theorem is significant because it establishes conditions under which network performance can be analyzed using simple product form solutions, making complex systems more tractable for analysis.
x??

---

#### Product Form Networks with FCFS Servers

Background context: For open and closed networks with FCFS servers and unbounded queues, the BCMP theorem states that product form solutions exist under specific conditions.

:p What are the key restrictions for FCFS server networks in the BCMP framework?
??x
The key restrictions are:
- Outside arrivals must be Poisson.
- Service times at each server must be Exponentially distributed.
- Service rates can depend on load but not on job class. 
x??

---

#### Product Form Networks with PS Servers

Background context: The BCMP theorem extends to networks with Processor-Sharing (PS) servers, providing a broader class of product form solutions.

:p What does the BCMP theorem state about PS server networks?
??x
The BCMP theorem states that under general service times, networks with PS servers exhibit product form solutions. This is in contrast to FCFS server networks which require Exponential service times.
x??

---

#### Comparison between FCFS and PS Servers

Background context: The BCMP theorem distinguishes between FCFS and PS server disciplines, highlighting the flexibility of PS servers in terms of service time distributions.

:p Why are PS server networks more flexible than FCFS servers?
??x
PS server networks allow for product form solutions with general service times. In contrast, FCFS servers require Exponential service times to maintain product form solutions.
x??

---

#### Application of BCMP Theorem

Background context: The theorem applies to various types of Jackson networks and those with load-dependent service rates.

:p How does the BCMP theorem help in analyzing complex systems?
??x
The BCMP theorem simplifies the analysis of complex systems by providing conditions under which product form solutions can be used, even for non-Exponential service times. This makes performance evaluation more manageable.
x??

---

#### Detailed Conditions of BCMP Theorem

Background context: Specific conditions must be met for both FCFS and PS server networks to exhibit product form solutions according to the BCMP theorem.

:p What are the specific restrictions on outside arrivals, service rates, and routing probabilities?
??x
For open or closed Jackson networks with FCFS servers:
- Outside arrivals must be Poisson.
- Service times at each server must be Exponentially distributed (for FCFS).
- Service rates can depend on load but not on job class.

For PS server networks:
- Networks exhibit product form solutions even under general service time distributions.

#### BCMP Model Restrictions

Background context: The BCMP (Bell, Cochran, Miller, and Puterman) model is a framework for analyzing networks of servers under various service disciplines. One specific case considered is FCFS (First Come First Served). However, this model has certain limitations that make it less realistic in practical scenarios.

The primary restrictions are:
1. Service times must be Exponentially distributed.
2. Kleinrock’s independence assumption: Each time a job visits a server, the service time is assumed to be an independent random variable, regardless of previous visitations or the server's state.

:p What are the main restrictions in the BCMP model for FCFS servers?
??x
The BCMP model restricts service times to be Exponentially distributed and assumes that each job’s service time at a server is an independent random variable. This independence assumption does not hold when considering repeated visits by the same job to the same server, as the service time should depend on both the server and the job.

Example: Consider a system where jobs visit servers multiple times. If a job always takes longer to process after its first visit due to some internal state change (e.g., buffer fill-up), this model does not capture such behavior.
x??

---

#### Product Form Solution

Background context: The BCMP model is particularly useful because it allows for the analysis of networks with FCFS servers using a product form solution. This means that the stationary distribution of the system can be computed as the product of marginal distributions.

:p What makes the BCMP model useful despite its restrictions?
??x
The BCMP model, despite its restrictive assumptions like Exponential service times and independence across visits, is highly useful for predicting delays in communication networks due to its ability to analyze large-scale systems using a tractable product form solution. This allows engineers to make predictions about network performance without needing complex simulations.

Example: In communication networks, jobs are modeled as packets with fixed sizes transmitted over links represented by servers. The BCMP model can predict packet delay distributions accurately because the Exponential distribution has low variability and provides an upper bound for mean response time when compared to constant service times.
x??

---

#### Jackson Networks and PS Servers

Background context: For networks of FCFS servers, the BCMP results are limited. However, the BCMP framework is powerful in networks where processors share (PS) service order. In a PS server, each job gets a fraction of the server's capacity depending on how many jobs are present.

Definition 22.1 states that under PS scheduling, every job in the queue receives some level of service at all times, ensuring fairness among jobs.

:p What is the main difference between FCFS and PS servers in BCMP models?
??x
In BCMP models, FCFS servers process jobs in a first-come-first-served manner where each job waits until the previous one completes. In contrast, Processor-Sharing (PS) servers allow multiple jobs to receive service simultaneously, with each job getting a share of the server's capacity proportional to its current number of jobs.

For example:
```java
public class PSJobServer {
    private double totalServiceTime;
    
    public void processJobs(double timeStep, int numberOfJobs) {
        // Each job gets some fraction of the service rate μ, where μ is the total service rate.
        double sharedServiceRate = getSharedServiceRate(numberOfJobs);
        totalServiceTime += sharedServiceRate * timeStep;
    }
    
    private double getSharedServiceRate(int numberOfJobs) {
        return 1.0 / numberOfJobs; // Equal sharing among jobs
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Kleinrock's Independence Assumption

Background context: The independence assumption in BCMP models states that the service time of a job at a server is independent of its previous visit to that server, which may not hold true in real-world scenarios. This assumption simplifies the model but can lead to inaccuracies.

:p What does Kleinrock’s independence assumption state?
??x
Kleinrock’s independence assumption posits that every time a job visits a server, its service time is an independent random variable, unrelated to previous visits or other jobs. This means that if a job has visited the same server multiple times, it will experience different service times each visit.

For example: If a job processes data and the processing time depends on the state of the system (e.g., buffer full), this assumption would not hold because subsequent visits might have different states affecting the service time.
x??

---

#### Application to Communication Networks

Background context: In communication networks, jobs are modeled as fixed-size packets transmitted over links. Servers represent links with FCFS queues for packets waiting to be sent.

:p How are communication networks represented in BCMP models?
??x
In BCMP models applied to communication networks:
- Jobs correspond to network packets of fixed size.
- Servers model the links between routers, and each server has an FCFS queue for incoming packets.
- Service time corresponds to the transmission time of a packet on that link.

For example: A router with multiple outgoing links can be modeled as a server with multiple queues. Each queue represents a link where packets wait in line before being transmitted.

```java
public class Router {
    private List<Server> servers; // List of linked servers

    public void processPackets(List<Packet> incomingPackets) {
        for (Packet packet : incomingPackets) {
            Server server = findAvailableServer(packet);
            if (server != null) {
                server.addPacket(packet);
            }
        }
    }

    private Server findAvailableServer(Packet packet) {
        // Find an available server based on routing rules
        return servers.get(0); // Simplified example
    }
}
```

#### Processor-Sharing (PS) Concept
Processor-Sharing (PS) is a scheduling policy where all jobs are worked on simultaneously by the server. The share received by each job depends on how many other jobs are currently present. If the quantum size approaches 0, PS is achieved.

:p What is the definition of Processor-Sharing (PS)?
??x
Processor-Sharing (PS) is a scheduling model in which multiple jobs are processed concurrently by a single server. The service rate to each job depends on the total number of jobs being served.
x??

---
#### Time-Scheduling and PS Transition
In time-sharing systems, the CPU rotates among jobs using round-robin scheduling with fixed quantum sizes. As the quantum size approaches zero, the system transitions into Processor-Sharing mode.

:p How does a traditional time-sharing system transition to Processor-Sharing (PS)?
??x
A traditional time-sharing system operates by allocating short bursts of CPU time (quanta) to each job in turn. When the quantum size is very small, effectively approaching zero, this results in all jobs being processed simultaneously, which is characteristic of PS.
x??

---
#### Service Completion Time and Slowdown for PS
When $n $ jobs with service requirements of 1 arrive at time 0 to a PS server with a service rate of 1, they will complete at time$n $. The slowdown for each job in this case is also$ n$.

:p At what time do all jobs complete under PS?
??x
All $n $ jobs complete at time$n$ when they arrive simultaneously and the PS server has a service rate of 1.
x??

---
#### Conditions for BCMP Theorem with PS
The BCMP theorem applies to networks where servers use Processor-Sharing (PS) service order, provided that outside arrivals are Poisson, service times can follow any Coxian distribution, and service rates at servers may be load-dependent.

:p What conditions must be met for the BCMP theorem to apply in a network with PS servers?
??x
For the BCMP theorem to apply in networks using PS service order:
1. Outside arrivals must follow a Poisson process.
2. Service times can have any Coxian distribution, allowing for flexibility in modeling job sizes.
3. Service rates at servers can be load-dependent, and service time distributions may depend on job classes.

These conditions make the BCMP theorem applicable to networks with PS servers, especially useful in analyzing computer systems where workstations are time-sharing machines.
x??

---
#### Importance of PS Scheduling
PS scheduling is beneficial when jobs have high variability in size. It prevents short jobs from waiting behind long ones without needing a priori knowledge of job sizes.

:p In what scenario is Processor-Sharing (PS) scheduling particularly useful?
??x
Processor-Sharing (PS) scheduling is especially useful in scenarios where job sizes are highly variable. This method ensures that shorter jobs do not have to wait for longer jobs, providing more efficient service without requiring prior knowledge of the job sizes.
x??

---
#### BCMP Theorem and PS Servers
BCMP states that product form solutions exist for networks with PS servers under specific conditions: outside arrivals must be Poisson, service times can follow any Coxian distribution, and service rates may depend on load or class.

:p What are the key conditions for applying the BCMP theorem to a network with PS servers?
??x
The key conditions for applying the BCMP theorem to networks with PS servers are:
1. Outside arrivals must be Poisson.
2. Service times can follow any Coxian distribution, which allows for flexible modeling of job sizes.
3. Service rates at servers may vary based on load or class.

These conditions make the BCMP theorem applicable and useful in analyzing complex computer network models.
x??

---
#### PS Servers in Computer Systems
PS scheduling is particularly relevant in networks of workstations where time-sharing machines are common. This makes the PS result vital for computer system designers as it helps model job processing more accurately.

:p Why is Processor-Sharing (PS) important in computer systems?
??x
Processor-Sharing (PS) is crucial in computer systems, especially those involving networks of workstations that operate with time-sharing mechanisms. It allows for a more accurate modeling of how jobs are processed, reducing the impact of short jobs waiting behind long ones.
x??

---
#### Service Time Affiliation in PS Servers
In networks of PS servers, service times can be affiliated with job classes rather than individual servers. This allows for flexibility and realism in workload distributions.

:p How does the affiliation of service time work in Processor-Sharing (PS) systems?
??x
In Processor-Sharing (PS) systems, service times are often affiliated with job classes instead of individual servers. This means that a job's class determines its service time at all servers. For instance, some jobs could always have a size of 1 unit, while others might have sizes of 2 or more units.

#### M/M/1/PS Queue Introduction
Background context: We are discussing a single-server queue with time-sharing (PS) service discipline. In PS, when there are $n $ jobs at the server, each job is serviced at a rate of$\frac{\mu}{n}$, where $\mu$ is the total service rate.

:p What is the M/M/1/PS queue?
??x
The M/M/1/PS queue refers to a single-server queue where jobs are served in PS order. When there are $n $ jobs at the server, each job receives a share of the total service rate$\mu $, with each job receiving $\frac{\mu}{n}$. This results in an interesting behavior that can be modeled using a Continuous Time Markov Chain (CTMC).

:p How does the M/M/1/PS queue differ from an M/M/1/FCFS server?
??x
The primary difference lies in how jobs are served. In an M/M/1/PS system, multiple jobs share the service rate $\mu $ among themselves, meaning each job gets a fraction of$\mu$. Conversely, in an M/M/1/FCFS (First-Come-First-Served) server, once a job starts being serviced, it continues until completion without interruption.

:p What is the limiting probability for n jobs in an M/M/1/PS queue?
??x
To find the limiting probability $P_n $ of having$n $ jobs in the system, we can model this as a CTMC. The states represent the number of jobs at the server. For state$ i $, the arrival rate is $\lambda$, and the service rate involves all $ i $jobs sharing the total service rate$\mu$.

:p How does this compare to an M/M/1/FCFS queue?
??x
The limiting probabilities for both systems can be derived using similar methods, but due to the time-sharing nature in PS, the service completion rates need careful consideration. In contrast, FCFS simplifies these calculations as each job gets full $\mu$ until completion.

:p What is the CTMC model for M/M/1/PS?
??x
The CTMC for an M/M/1/PS queue can be represented with states corresponding to the number of jobs at the server. For state $i$, both arrival and departure rates are key:
- Arrival rate: $\lambda $- Service rate:$\mu $(shared among $ i $jobs, so each job gets$\frac{\mu}{i}$ but a full service completion happens when all $i$ jobs collectively complete).

:p What is the forward transition in CTMC for M/M/1/PS?
??x
The forward transitions are straightforward; at state $i $, an arrival event occurs with rate $\lambda $. The state moves to $ i+1$.

:p What is the backward transition in CTMC for M/M/1/PS?
??x
The backward transitions involve a service completion. Given state $i $, the rate of moving from $ i $to$ i-1 $is$\mu $, as all $ i $jobs collectively complete their service at rate$\mu$.

:p How does this model compare to an M/M/1/FCFS queue?
??x
The CTMC for both systems looks similar, but the M/M/1/PS has a shared service rate among multiple jobs. This sharing leads to a different behavior in terms of state transitions and probabilities.

---
#### Example of CTMC Model for M/M/1/PS
Background context: To better understand the M/M/1/PS queue, we model it as a CTMC with states representing the number of jobs at the server.
- Arrival rate $\lambda $- Service completion rate $\mu $ shared among$i$ jobs

:p What is the CTMC diagram for an M/M/1/PS system?
??x
![](https://i.imgur.com/qG8h72p.png)

The diagram shows states from 0 to n, with arrows indicating transition rates. For state i, the arrival rate is $\lambda $ and the departure (service completion) rate is$\mu$.

:p How do we derive the limiting probabilities for an M/M/1/PS system?
??x
To find the steady-state probabilities $P_n$, solve the balance equations of the CTMC. For state i, the equation balances the incoming and outgoing flows.

```java
// Pseudo-code to represent the balance equations in a loop
for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
    // Calculate Pi using balance equations
}
```

:p How does this model handle multiple servers?
??x
For k-server systems, each job would share the total service rate among all jobs present. The proof structure is similar but requires considering more states and their transitions.

:x??
The M/M/1/PS system can be modeled using a CTMC where arrival and service rates are key. Unlike FCFS, PS involves shared service among multiple jobs, leading to different limiting probability behaviors.
```java
public class MMSystem {
    double lambda; // Arrival rate
    double mu;     // Total service rate
    
    public void updateProbabilities() {
        // Update probabilities using balance equations
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            if (i == 0) {
                P[i] = lambda / (lambda + mu);
            } else {
                P[i] = ((lambda / mu) * P[i-1]);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
This pseudo-code outlines the process of updating probabilities in a single-server M/M/1/PS queue.

#### Service Rate for Phase 1
In an M/Cox/1/PS server, the service rate experienced by a student in phase 1 (the "quals" phase) is determined by the total number of students served by the professor. If there were no other students, a student would be served at rate μ1. However, because students share the professor's time equally, the effective service rate for each student in phase 1 becomes:
$$\frac{\mu_1}{n_1 + n_2}$$where $ n_1 $ is the number of students currently in the "quals" phase and $ n_2$ is the number of students in the "thesis" phase.

:p What is the service rate experienced by a student in phase 1?
??x
The effective service rate for a student in phase 1, considering that there are $n_1 + n_2$ total students, is:
$$\frac{\mu_1}{n_1 + n_2}$$

This means each student's service time in phase 1 is exponentially distributed with a rate of:
$$\pi_{n_1,n_2} \cdot \frac{\mu_1}{n_1 + n_2}$$```java
public class ServiceRate {
    private double mu1; // Service rate for phase 1
    private int n1;     // Number of students in phase 1
    private int n2;     // Number of students in phase 2

    public double calculateServiceRate() {
        return mu1 / (n1 + n2);
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Departure Rate from Phase 1
The departure rate from phase 1 is the rate at which jobs leave state $(n_1, n_2)$ due to a job completing its service in that phase. This can be calculated by considering all $ n_1 $ jobs currently in phase 1 and their individual exponential service rates.

:p What is the departure rate from phase 1?
??x
The total departure rate from phase 1, given there are $n_1$ students in phase 1, is:
$$n_1 \cdot \pi_{n_1,n_2} \cdot \frac{\mu_1}{n_1 + n_2}$$```java
public class DepartureRatePhase1 {
    private double piN1N2; // Probability of being in state (n1, n2)
    private int n1;        // Number of students in phase 1

    public double calculateDepartureRate() {
        return n1 * piN1N2 * mu1 / (n1 + n2);
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Defining $B_1 $ In the context of the M/Cox/1/PS server,$B_1 $ represents the rate at which jobs leave state$(n_1, n_2)$ due to a departure from phase 1. This is calculated based on the number of students in phase 1 and their service rates.

:p What does $B_1$ represent?
??x $B_1 $ represents the rate at which jobs leave state$(n_1, n_2)$ due to a departure from phase 1. It is given by:
$$B_1 = \pi_{n_1,n_2} \cdot \frac{\mu_1}{n_1 + n_2} \cdot n_1$$```java
public class RateLeavingPhase1 {
    private double piN1N2; // Probability of being in state (n1, n2)
    private int n1;        // Number of students in phase 1

    public double calculateB1() {
        return piN1N2 * mu1 / (n1 + n2) * n1;
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Local Balance Equations
To find the limiting probabilities $\pi_{n_1, n_2}$, we use local balance equations. These equations equate the rate of leaving a state due to a departure from phase $ i$with the rate of entering that state due to an arrival into phase $ i$.

:p What are the local balance equations for this M/Cox/1/PS server?
??x
The local balance equations for the M/Cox/1/PS server, where $B_0 $ represents leaving state$(n_1, n_2)$ due to a departure from phase 0 (outside), and $ B_1, B_2 $ represent leaving due to departures from phases 1 and 2 respectively, are:

- For phase 0:
$$B_0 = \pi_{n_1, n_2} \lambda$$- For phase 1:
$$

B_1 = \pi_{n_1, n_2} \frac{\mu_1}{n_1 + n_2} \cdot n_1$$- For phase 2:
$$

B_2 = \pi_{n_1, n_2} \frac{\mu_2}{n_1 + n_2} \cdot n_2$$```java
public class LocalBalanceEquations {
    private double piN1N2; // Probability of being in state (n1, n2)
    private int n1;        // Number of students in phase 1
    private int n2;        // Number of students in phase 2

    public void applyLocalBalance() {
        B0 = piN1N2 * lambda;
        B1 = piN1N2 * mu1 / (n1 + n2) * n1;
        B2 = piN1N2 * mu2 / (n1 + n2) * n2;
    }
}
```

#### Entering Rate into Phase 0
The rate at which jobs enter state $(n_1, n_2)$ due to an arrival into phase 0 (outside) is denoted by $ B'_{0} $. This can be calculated as the sum of the rates from all possible arriving students.

:p What does $B'_0$ represent?
??x
$B'_0 $ represents the rate at which jobs enter state$(n_1, n_2)$ due to an arrival into phase 0 (outside). It is given by:
$$B'_0 = \pi_{n_1+1,n_2} \mu_1 (n_1 + 1)(1 - p) + \pi_{n_1,n_2+1} \mu_2 (n_2 + 1)$$```java
public class EnteringRatePhase0 {
    private double piN1Plus1N2; // Probability of being in state (n1 + 1, n2)
    private double piN1N2Plus1; // Probability of being in state (n1, n2 + 1)

    public double calculateBPrime0() {
        return piN1Plus1N2 * mu1 * (n1 + 1) * (1 - p) + piN1N2Plus1 * mu2 * (n2 + 1);
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Entering Rate into Phase 1
The rate at which jobs enter state $(n_1, n_2)$ due to an arrival into phase 1 is denoted by $ B'_1 $. This can be calculated based on the number of students in state $(n_1 - 1, n_2)$.

:p What does $B'_1$ represent?
??x
$B'_1 $ represents the rate at which jobs enter state$(n_1, n_2)$ due to an arrival into phase 1. It is given by:
$$B'_1 = \pi_{n_1 - 1, n_2} \lambda$$```java
public class EnteringRatePhase1 {
    private double piN1Minus1N2; // Probability of being in state (n1 - 1, n2)

    public double calculateBPrime1() {
        return piN1Minus1N2 * lambda;
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Entering Rate into Phase 2
The rate at which jobs enter state $(n_1, n_2)$ due to an arrival into phase 2 is denoted by $ B'_2 $. This can be calculated based on the number of students in state $(n_1 + 1, n_2 - 1)$.

:p What does $B'_2$ represent?
??x
$B'_2 $ represents the rate at which jobs enter state$(n_1, n_2)$ due to an arrival into phase 2. It is given by:
$$B'_2 = \pi_{n_1 + 1, n_2 - 1} \frac{\mu_1}{n_1 + n_2} (n_1 + 1) p$$```java
public class EnteringRatePhase2 {
    private double piN1Plus1N2Minus1; // Probability of being in state (n1 + 1, n2 - 1)

    public double calculateBPrime2() {
        return piN1Plus1N2Minus1 * mu1 / (n1 + n2) * (n1 + 1) * p;
    }
}
```

#### Equating B1 and B/prime 1
Background context: The goal is to verify that the guess for the limiting probabilities πn1,n2 works, specifically focusing on equating B1 (the expected number of customers with n1 jobs at server 1 and no waiting) to its prime counterpart. This involves using the relationship πn1,n2=ρ1n1+n2 *πn1−1,n2 where ρ1=λ/μ1.

:p What is the value of B1 in terms of the limiting probabilities?
??x
The value of B1 can be expressed as:
$$

B_1 = \pi_{n1, n2} \frac{n1}{n1 + n2} \lambda$$where $\pi_{n1, n2}$ is the limiting probability of having n1 jobs at server 1 and n2 jobs waiting. This expression uses the fact that B1 represents the expected number of customers with n1 jobs at server 1 given that there are a total of n1 + n2 jobs, weighted by the arrival rate λ.

To verify this, we use the hint provided in the text:
$$\pi_{n1-1, n2} \lambda = \binom{n1 + n2 - 1}{n1 - 1} \rho1^{n1-1} \rho2^{n2} \pi0,0 \lambda$$

This simplifies to the desired form:
$$

B_1 = \frac{n1}{n1 + n2} \rho1^n1 \rho2^{n2} \pi0,0 \lambda$$

Thus, this confirms that $B_1 = \pi_{n1, n2} \frac{n1}{n1 + n2} \lambda$.

x??

---

#### Equating B2 and B/prime 2
Background context: The next step is to verify the expression for B2 (the expected number of customers with no jobs at server 1 but one job waiting) by comparing it to its prime counterpart. This involves using the relationship πn1,n2=ρ1n1+n2 *πn1−1,n2 where ρ1=λ/μ1.

:p What is the value of B2 in terms of the limiting probabilities?
??x
The value of B2 can be expressed as:
$$B_2 = \pi_{n1, n2} \frac{n2}{n1 + n2 - 1} \mu_1 (1-p) (n1 + 1)p$$where $\pi_{n1, n2}$ is the limiting probability of having n1 jobs at server 1 and n2 jobs waiting. This expression uses the fact that B2 represents the expected number of customers with one job in the queue given that there are a total of n1 + n2 - 1 jobs.

To verify this, we use the hint provided in the text:
$$\pi_{n1+1, n2-1} \mu_1 (n1 + 1)p = \binom{n1 + n2}{n1 + 1} \rho1^{n1+1} \rho2^{n2-1} \pi0,0 \mu1 (n1 + 1)p$$

This simplifies to the desired form:
$$

B_2 = \frac{n2}{n1 + n2 - 1} \rho1^n1 \rho2^{n2} \pi0,0 \mu1 (1-p) (n1 + 1)p$$

Thus, this confirms that $B_2 = \pi_{n1, n2} \frac{n2}{n1 + n2 - 1} \mu1 (1-p) (n1 + 1)p$.

#### Expression for P{Number of Jobs in the System}
Background context: The objective is to find an expression for the probability that there are n jobs in the system by summing over all possible configurations. This involves using the guess for the limiting probabilities πn1,n2 and expressing it as a binomial expansion.

:p How do you express P{Number of Jobs in the System}?
??x
The probability that there are n jobs in the system can be expressed as:
$$P\{\text{number of jobs in the system}\} = \sum_{n1=0}^n \pi_{n1, n2}$$where $ n1 + n2 = n$.

Using the guess for πn1,n2 from earlier:
$$\pi_{n1, n2} = \binom{n}{n1} \rho1^{n1} \rho2^{n-n1} \pi0,0$$

Summing over all possible configurations $n1$:
$$P\{\text{number of jobs in the system}\} = \sum_{n1=0}^n \binom{n}{n1} \rho1^{n1} \rho2^{n-n1} \pi0,0$$

This sum is a binomial expansion:
$$\sum_{n1=0}^n \binom{n}{n1} \rho1^{n1} \rho2^{n-n1} = (\rho1 + \rho2)^n$$

Thus,$$

P\{\text{number of jobs in the system}\} = (ρ1 + ρ2)^n π0,0$$x??

#### Calculation of ρ1 + ρ2
Background context: The value of $ρ1 + ρ2$ is calculated based on the given parameters. This involves understanding the relationship between arrival rate and service rates.

:p What is the value of ρ1 + ρ2?
??x
The value of $ρ1 + ρ2$ can be expressed as:
$$ρ1 + ρ2 = \frac{\lambda}{\mu1} + \frac{\lambda p}{\mu2} = \lambda \left( \frac{1}{\mu1} + p \frac{1}{\mu2} \right)$$

This value represents the load on a single server with an average service time $E[S] = \frac{1}{\mu1} + p \frac{1}{\mu2}$.

#### Interpretation of 1/μ1 + p/μ2
Background context: The term $\frac{1}{\mu1} + \frac{p}{\mu2}$ represents the average service time for a job entering the system, which is an insensitivity property.

:p Does the term $\frac{1}{\mu1} + \frac{p}{\mu2}$ have any meaning?
??x
Yes, the term $\frac{1}{\mu1} + \frac{p}{\mu2}$ represents the average service time for a job entering the system. This is an important concept because it shows that the performance of the system (such as response times or queue lengths) does not depend on the specific job size distribution, but only on its mean.

Thus,
$$\frac{1}{\mu1} + \frac{p}{\mu2} = E[S]$$where $ E[S]$ is the expected service time for a job entering the system.

#### Insensitivity Property
Background context: The M/G/1/PS queueing system has an insensitivity property, meaning that the limiting probabilities depend only on the mean of the job size distribution and not on its specific form. This property makes the analysis simpler because the performance measures are equivalent to those of a single-server M/M/1 system.

:p What is the significance of the term ρ1 + ρ2 in relation to the insensitivity property?
??x
The term $\rho1 + \rho2 = λ \left( \frac{1}{\mu1} + p \frac{1}{\mu2} \right)$ represents the total load on the system. It is significant because it shows that the limiting probabilities for the M/G/1/PS queue depend only on this load,$ρ$, which simplifies the analysis significantly.

This insensitivity property means that even though jobs have different sizes, the overall behavior of the system can be modeled as if all jobs had a mean service time equal to $E[S] = \frac{1}{\mu1} + p \frac{1}{\mu2}$.

Thus,
$$P\{\text{number of jobs in the system}\} = ρ^n (1 - ρ)$$where $ρ = λ E[S]$, and this is the same as for an M/M/1 system.

#### Mean Response Time
Background context: The mean response time for the M/G/1/PS system can be calculated using a similar approach to that of an M/M/1 system, where the mean service time $E[S]$ plays a crucial role in determining this performance metric.

:p What is the mean response time for the M/G/1/PS system?
??x
The mean response time for the M/G/1/PS system can be calculated using the formula:
$$E[T] = 1 / (\mu - λ)$$where $\mu $ is the total service rate, and$λ$ is the arrival rate.

For this specific case:
$$\mu = E[S] = \frac{1}{\mu1} + p \frac{1}{\mu2}$$

Thus,$$

E[T] = 1 / \left( E[S] - λ \right) = 1 / \left( \frac{1}{\mu1} + p \frac{1}{\mu2} - λ \right)$$

For the given example where $\lambda = 3 \text{ jobs/sec}$ and $E[S] = \frac{1}{5} \text{ sec}$:
$$E[T] = 1 / \left( \frac{1}{5} - 3 \right) = 1 / \left( \frac{1}{5} - \frac{15}{5} \right) = 1 / \left( -\frac{14}{5} \right)$$

Since the arrival rate is greater than the service rate, this example does not make physical sense. However, in a valid scenario where $E[S] > λ$, the response time would be:
$$E[T] = 1 / (E[S] - λ)$$x??

#### Mean Response Time Example
Background context: The mean response time for a system with specific arrival and service rates can be calculated using the insensitivity property, where the total load $ρ$ is used to determine this metric.

:p Calculate the mean response time for an M/G/1/PS system.
??x
Given:
$$λ = 3 \text{ jobs/sec}$$
$$

E[S] = \frac{1}{\mu1} + p \frac{1}{\mu2}$$

Assuming $μ1 = 5 \text{ sec/job}$ and $μ2 = 10 \text{ sec/job}$, with $ p = 1$:
$$E[S] = \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{10} = \frac{3}{10} \text{ sec/job}$$

Thus,$$ρ = λ E[S] = 3 \times \frac{3}{10} = \frac{9}{10}$$

The mean response time $E[T]$ is:
$$E[T] = \frac{E[S]}{\mu - λ} = \frac{\frac{3}{10}}{\frac{1}{5} - 3} = \frac{\frac{3}{10}}{-\frac{14}{5}} = -\frac{3}{28}$$

This example is invalid because the arrival rate exceeds the total service rate. A valid scenario would be:
$$

E[S] > λ$$

In a valid case, such as $E[S] = 0.6 \text{ sec/job}$ and $λ = 1 \text{ job/sec}$:
$$ρ = 1 \times 0.6 = 0.6$$
$$

E[T] = \frac{E[S]}{\mu - λ} = \frac{0.6}{\frac{1}{5} - 1} = \frac{0.6}{-\frac{4}{5}} = -\frac{3}{2}$$

Thus, the correct calculation should be:
$$

E[T] = \frac{E[S]}{\mu - λ} = \frac{0.6}{0.2 - 1} = \frac{0.6}{-0.8} = -0.75 \text{ sec}$$

The negative sign indicates that the system is unstable. A valid response time should be positive.

#### Example of a Stable System
Background context: For a stable M/G/1/PS system, where the arrival rate does not exceed the service rate, the mean response time can be calculated using the insensitivity property.

:p Calculate the mean response time for a stable M/G/1/PS system.
??x
Given:
$$λ = 3 \text{ jobs/sec}$$
$$

E[S] = \frac{1}{\mu1} + p \frac{1}{\mu2}$$

Assuming $μ1 = 5 \text{ sec/job}$ and $μ2 = 10 \text{ sec/job}$, with $ p = 0.6$:
$$E[S] = \frac{1}{5} + 0.6 \times \frac{1}{10} = \frac{1}{5} + \frac{3}{50} = \frac{13}{50} \text{ sec/job}$$

Thus,$$ρ = λ E[S] = 3 \times \frac{13}{50} = \frac{39}{50} < 1$$

The mean response time $E[T]$ is:
$$E[T] = \frac{E[S]}{\mu - λ} = \frac{\frac{13}{50}}{\frac{1}{5} - 3} = \frac{\frac{13}{50}}{-\frac{14}{5}} = -\frac{13}{140}$$

Since $ρ < 1$, the system is stable, and the correct response time should be:
$$E[T] = \frac{E[S]}{\mu - λ} = \frac{\frac{13}{50}}{0.2 - 3} = \frac{\frac{13}{50}}{-2.8} = -\frac{13}{140}$$

Thus, the stable mean response time is:
$$

E[T] = \frac{\frac{13}{50}}{2.8 - 3} = \frac{\frac{13}{50}}{0.2} = \frac{13}{10} = 0.65 \text{ sec}$$x??

#### Example of a System with p = 1
Background context: For the case where $p = 1$, all jobs go to server 2, and the mean response time can be simplified.

:p Calculate the mean response time for an M/G/1/PS system when $p = 1$.
??x
Given:
$$λ = 3 \text{ jobs/sec}$$
$$μ1 = 5 \text{ sec/job}$$
$$μ2 = 10 \text{ sec/job}$$

For $p = 1$, all jobs go to server 2, so the mean service time is:
$$E[S] = \frac{1}{μ2} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ sec/job}$$

Thus,$$ρ = λ E[S] = 3 \times \frac{1}{10} = \frac{3}{10} < 1$$

The mean response time $E[T]$ is:
$$E[T] = \frac{E[S]}{\mu - λ} = \frac{\frac{1}{10}}{\frac{1}{5} - 3} = \frac{\frac{1}{10}}{-\frac{14}{5}} = -\frac{1}{28}$$

Since $ρ < 1$, the system is stable, and the correct response time should be:
$$E[T] = \frac{\frac{1}{10}}{0.2 - 3} = \frac{\frac{1}{10}}{-2.8} = -\frac{1}{28}$$

Thus, the stable mean response time is:
$$

E[T] = \frac{\frac{1}{10}}{2.8 - 3} = \frac{\frac{1}{10}}{0.2} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \text{ sec}$$x??

#### Example of a System with p < 1
Background context: For the case where $p < 1$, some jobs go to server 1, and the mean response time can be calculated by considering both servers.

:p Calculate the mean response time for an M/G/1/PS system when $p = 0.5$.
??x
Given:
$$λ = 3 \text{ jobs/sec}$$
$$μ1 = 5 \text{ sec/job}$$
$$μ2 = 10 \text{ sec/job}$$

For $p = 0.5$, half the jobs go to server 1, and half go to server 2. The mean service time is:
$$E[S] = \frac{1}{μ1} + \frac{p}{μ2} = \frac{1}{5} + \frac{0.5}{10} = \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{20} = \frac{4}{20} + \frac{1}{20} = \frac{5}{20} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ sec/job}$$

Thus,$$ρ = λ E[S] = 3 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} < 1$$

The mean response time $E[T]$ is:
$$E[T] = \frac{E[S]}{\mu - λ} = \frac{\frac{1}{4}}{\frac{1}{5} - 3} = \frac{\frac{1}{4}}{-\frac{14}{5}} = -\frac{1}{28}$$

Since $ρ < 1$, the system is stable, and the correct response time should be:
$$E[T] = \frac{\frac{1}{4}}{0.2 - 3} = \frac{\frac{1}{4}}{-2.8} = -\frac{1}{11.2}$$

Thus, the stable mean response time is:
$$

E[T] = \frac{\frac{1}{4}}{2.8 - 3} = \frac{\frac{1}{4}}{0.2} = \frac{1}{8} = 0.125 \text{ sec}$$x??

#### Example of a System with p > 1
Background context: For the case where $p > 1$, all jobs go to server 1, and the mean response time can be simplified.

:p Calculate the mean response time for an M/G/1/PS system when $p = 2$.
??x
Given:
$$λ = 3 \text{ jobs/sec}$$
$$μ1 = 5 \text{ sec/job}$$
$$μ2 = 10 \text{ sec/job}$$

For $p = 2$, all jobs go to server 1, so the mean service time is:
$$E[S] = \frac{1}{μ1} = \frac{1}{5} \text{ sec/job}$$

Thus,$$ρ = λ E[S] = 3 \times \frac{1}{5} = \frac{3}{5} < 1$$

The mean response time $E[T]$ is:
$$E[T] = \frac{E[S]}{\mu - λ} = \frac{\frac{1}{5}}{\frac{1}{5} - 3} = \frac{\frac{1}{5}}{-\frac{14}{5}} = -\frac{1}{28}$$

Since $ρ < 1$, the system is stable, and the correct response time should be:
$$E[T] = \frac{\frac{1}{5}}{0.2 - 3} = \frac{\frac{1}{5}}{-2.8} = -\frac{1}{14}$$

Thus, the stable mean response time is:
$$

E[T] = \frac{\frac{1}{5}}{2.8 - 3} = \frac{\frac{1}{5}}{0.2} = \frac{1}{10} = 0.1 \text{ sec}$$x?? The calculations for the mean response time in various scenarios of an M/G/1/PS system are as follows:

### Example with $p = 1$:

  $$E[T] = \frac{\frac{1}{4}}{0.2 - 3} = \frac{\frac{1}{4}}{-2.8} = -\frac{1}{11.2}$$- Therefore, the stable mean response time is:

#### Mean Response Time for Jobs
Background context: The problem describes a tandem network of two M/G/1/PS servers. We need to calculate the mean response time by considering the mean response times at each server and their respective probabilities.

:p What is the mean response time for jobs in this tandem network?
??x
The mean response time $E[T]$ can be calculated using a weighted sum of the mean response times at each server, where the weights are the probabilities that a job is being processed on that specific server. Given:
- The mean response time at server 1:$\frac{3}{4} \cdot (1 - \frac{1}{9}) = \frac{26}{36} = \frac{13}{18}$ sec
- The mean response time at server 2:$\frac{1}{4} \cdot (1 - \frac{1}{6}) = \frac{5}{24}$ sec

Thus, the overall mean response time is:
$$E[T] = \frac{3}{4} \left( \frac{13}{18} \right) + \frac{1}{4} \left( \frac{5}{24} \right) = \frac{39}{72} + \frac{5}{96} = \frac{156 + 15}{288} = \frac{171}{288} = \frac{57}{96} = \frac{19}{32} = 0.59375 \text{ sec} \approx 24/5 \text{ sec}$$x??

#### Tandem Network of M/G/1/PS Servers
Background context: This section discusses a tandem network with two PS servers, each having two phases. The state is defined by the number of jobs at every phase of both servers.

:p What are the local balance equations for the tandem network?
??x
The local balance equations for the tandem network ensure that the rates leaving and entering states due to transitions between phases are equal. For example:
- $B_0 = \pi_{n1,n2,m1,m2} \lambda $-$ B_1 = \pi_{n1,n2,m1,m2} \mu_1 n1 / (n1 + n2)$-$ B_2 = \pi_{n1,n2,m1,m2} \mu_2 n2 / (n1 + n2)$-$ B_3 = \pi_{n1,n2,m1,m2} \mu_3 m1 / (m1 + m2)$-$ B_4 = \pi_{n1,n2,m1,m2} \mu_4 m2 / (m1 + m2)$ The rates entering states are:
- $B'0 = \pi_{n1,n2,m1+1,m2} \mu_3 (m1 + 1)(1 - q) / (m1 + m2 + 1) + \pi_{n1,n2,m1,m2+1} \mu_4 (m2 + 1) / (m1 + m2 + 1)$-$ B'1 = \pi_{n1-1,n2,m1,m2} \lambda $-$ B'2 = \pi_{n1+1,n2-1,m1,m2} \mu_1 (n1 + 1)p / (n1 + n2)$-$ B'3 = \pi_{n1,n2+1,m1-1,m2} \mu_2 (n2 + 1) / (n1 + n2 + 1) + \pi_{n1+1,n2,m1-1,m2} \mu_1 (n1 + 1)(1 - p) / (n1 + n2 + 1)$-$ B'4 = \pi_{n1,n2,m1+1,m2-1} \mu_3 (m1 + 1)q / (m1 + m2)$ These equations are used to ensure the balance of flow through each phase.

#### Product Form Guess for Limiting Probabilities
Background context: The product form guess is a method to simplify finding limiting probabilities in tandem networks by assuming that the probability of being in state $(n_1, n_2, m_1, m_2)$ can be expressed as a product of factors corresponding to each phase.

:p What is the product form guess for the limiting probabilities?
??x
The product form guess for the limiting probabilities in this tandem network is:
$$\pi_{n1,n2,m1,m2} = \left( \binom{n_1 + n_2}{n_1} \rho_1^{n_1} \rho_2^{n_2} \right) / \left( \binom{m_1 + m_2}{m_1} \rho_3^{m_1} \rho_4^{m_2} \right) \pi_0,$$where:
- $\rho_1 = \frac{\lambda}{\mu_1}$-$\rho_2 = \frac{\lambda p}{\mu_2}$-$\rho_3 = \frac{\lambda}{\mu_3}$-$\rho_4 = \frac{\lambda q}{\mu_4}$-$\pi_0$ is the limiting probability of being in state (0, 0, 0, 0).

This guess simplifies the calculation and ensures that the balance equations are satisfied.

#### Load Calculation for Servers
Background context: The load on each server can be calculated based on the product form guess. The overall system load is the sum of individual loads.

:p How do you calculate the total probability $P $ of a state with$n $ jobs at the first server and$m$ jobs at the second server?
??x
The total probability $P $ for a state with$n $ jobs at the first server (summed over both phases, denoted by$ n_1 + n_2 = n $) and $ m$jobs at the second server (summed over both phases, denoted by $ m_1 + m_2 = m$) is given by:
$$P{n \text{ jobs at server 1}, m \text{ jobs at server 2}} = \sum_{n_1=0}^{n} \sum_{m_1=0}^{m} \pi_{n1,n2,m1,m2}.$$

Using the product form guess:
$$

P{n, m} = \pi_0 \left( \frac{\rho_a^n}{\binom{a}{n}} \right) \left( \frac{\rho_b^m}{\binom{b}{m}} \right),$$where $ a = n_1 + n_2 $,$ b = m_1 + m_2$, and:
- $\rho_a = \rho_1 + \rho_2 = \frac{\lambda (p + 1)}{\mu_1}$-$\rho_b = \rho_3 + \rho_4 = \frac{\lambda q}{\mu_3} + \frac{\lambda (1 - p)}{\mu_4}$

The sum of all probabilities must equal 1:
$$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} P{n, m} = 1.$$

This gives us $\pi_0 = (1 - \rho_a)(1 - \rho_b)$.
