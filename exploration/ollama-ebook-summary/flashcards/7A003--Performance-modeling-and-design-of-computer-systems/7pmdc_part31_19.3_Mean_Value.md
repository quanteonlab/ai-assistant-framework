#### Limiting Probabilities and Performance Metrics
Background context: In analyzing a closed system, determining performance metrics such as the number of jobs at servers and utilization is crucial. The limiting probabilities provide these values by summing certain terms.

:p What does E[Number at server 1] represent in this context?
??x
E[Number at server 1] represents the expected number of jobs found at server 1, which can be calculated using the given formula: π1,0,1 + π1,1,0 + 2π2,0,0 = 1.589.

This calculation takes into account the probability distributions (limiting probabilities) across different states to determine the mean number of jobs at a specific server.
x??

---
#### Utilization of Server
Background context: The utilization of a server can be calculated by subtracting certain terms from 1, which represent the probabilities of having no jobs or one job in the system.

:p How is the utilization of server 1 determined?
??x
The utilization of server 1 is given by the formula:
1 - π0,0,2 - π0,2,0 - π0,1,1 = 0.924.
This equation subtracts from 1 the probabilities that there are no jobs (π0,0,2), two jobs in a different state (π0,2,0), and one job in another state (π0,1,1) to determine the portion of time the server is occupied.

This calculation provides an insight into how busy the server is, which is essential for performance analysis.
x??

#### Mean Value Analysis (MVA)
Background context: Mean Value Analysis is a method used for analyzing closed product form networks. It focuses on calculating mean metrics rather than individual distributions and involves recursive relationships between systems with different numbers of jobs.

:p What is Mean Value Analysis (MVA) primarily used to provide?
??x
Mean Value Analysis (MVA) is primarily used to provide mean metrics, such as the average number of jobs at each server in a closed network. It does not delve into individual distributions but instead calculates these means recursively by relating larger systems to smaller ones.

The key recursive relationship involves calculating the mean number of jobs at a specific server $j $ when there are$M $ total jobs, based on the same calculation for$M-1$ total jobs.
x??

---
#### Arrival Theorem
Background context: The Arrival Theorem provides a way to understand how an arrival in a network with $M$ jobs sees the system. It states that this distribution is equivalent to the steady-state distribution of a similar system but with one fewer job.

:p What does the Arrival Theorem state about an arrival's observation?
??x
The Arrival Theorem states that when an arrival observes the number of jobs at each server in a closed Jackson network with $M > 1 $ total jobs, it sees the same distribution as the steady-state distribution of a similar network but with$M-1$ total jobs.

In particular, the mean number of jobs observed by the arrival at server $j $ is$E\left[N(M-1)_j\right]$.

This theorem simplifies analysis by allowing us to build up from smaller systems (with fewer jobs) and use this relationship recursively.
x??

---

#### Concept: Arrival Theorem in Closed Networks
The Arrival Theorem, often seen as the counterpart to PASTA (Poisson Arrivals See Time Averages) for closed systems, states that arrivals see a time average of the state of the system. However, this theorem requires job sizes to be exponentially distributed.

:p What is the primary condition required by the Arrival Theorem for its validity?
??x
The primary condition required by the Arrival Theorem for its validity is that job sizes must follow an exponential distribution.
x??

---

#### Concept: Example of a Counterexample in Closed Networks
An example provided shows a scenario where the Arrival Theorem does not hold. In this case, we consider a closed system with two servers and two jobs moving deterministically between them.

:p Can you provide an example demonstrating when the Arrival Theorem fails?
??x
In a closed network consisting of two servers in tandem, starting with one job at each server, the service time at each server is deterministically 1 unit. Consequently, jobs move in lock-step, ensuring that there is always exactly one job at each server.

When an arrival (job j) arrives at Server 1, it will observe 0 jobs at Server 1 because both jobs are moving between the servers. However, the expected number of jobs at Server 1 over a long period $E\left[N(1)\right]$ is 1/2.

The failure of the Arrival Theorem in this scenario arises because job sizes are not exponentially distributed.
x??

---

#### Concept: Limiting Probabilities for Closed Jackson Networks
For closed Jackson networks, limiting probabilities can be expressed as:
$$\pi^{(M)}_{n_1, n_2, ..., n_k} = C(M) \prod_{j=1}^k \left(\frac{\lambda_j}{\mu_j}\right)^{n_j},$$where $ M $ is the total number of jobs, and $ C(M)$ is a normalizing constant.

:p How are limiting probabilities for closed Jackson networks defined?
??x
Limiting probabilities for closed Jackson networks are given by:
$$\pi^{(M)}_{n_1, n_2, ..., n_k} = C(M) \prod_{j=1}^k \left(\frac{\lambda_j}{\mu_j}\right)^{n_j},$$where $ M $ is the total number of jobs and $ C(M)$ is a normalizing constant. This formula shows how the probability distribution of the system's state depends on the job sizes at each server.

To make these probabilities independent of the number of jobs, we define:
$$p_j = \frac{\lambda_j}{\lambda},$$where $\lambda$ is the total arrival rate into all servers. Using this, the limiting probability can be rewritten as:
$$\pi^{(M)}_{n_1, n_2, ..., n_k} = C' \prod_{j=1}^k p_j^{n_j},$$where $ C'$ is a new normalizing constant.
x??

#### Concept: Derivation of Mean Response Time
The mean response time in a closed system can be derived using the Arrival Theorem and limiting probabilities.

:p How is the mean response time derived in a closed system?
??x
To derive the mean response time $E\left[T(M)\right]$ in a closed system, we use the following steps:

1. **Arrival Theorem**: Jobs arriving at any server see a time average of the state of the system.
2. **Limiting Probabilities**: Use the derived probabilities to understand the distribution of jobs across servers.

The mean response time can be calculated as:
$$E\left[T(M)\right] = \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{1}{\mu_i},$$where $ k $ is the number of servers, and $\mu_i $ is the service rate at server$i$.

This formula sums up the reciprocal of each server's service rate to give the average response time.
x??

---

#### Concept: Normalizing Constant in Limiting Probabilities
The normalizing constant $C(M)$ ensures that the probabilities sum up to 1.

:p What is the role of the normalizing constant $C(M)$ in limiting probabilities?
??x
The normalizing constant $C(M)$ plays a crucial role in ensuring that the probabilities defined by:
$$\pi^{(M)}_{n_1, n_2, ..., n_k} = C(M) \prod_{j=1}^k \left(\frac{\lambda_j}{\mu_j}\right)^{n_j},$$sum up to 1. This constant adjusts the probabilities so that they are valid and add up correctly for a given number of jobs $ M$.

For closed Jackson networks, this constant depends on $M$, but we can redefine it as:
$$p_j = \frac{\lambda_j}{\lambda},$$where $\lambda $ is the total arrival rate. This redefinition makes the probabilities independent of$M$.
x??

---

#### Probability of Observing a State
Background context explaining how the probability that job $x $ observes state$(n_1, n_2, ..., n_k)$, where $\sum_{j=1}^k n_j = M-1$, can be derived as a ratio of rates.
The formula given is:
$$P\left\{ \text{job } x \text{ observes } (n_1, n_2, ..., n_k) \mid \sum_{j=1}^k n_j = M-1 \right\} = \frac{\pi(M)_{n_1,...,n_i+1,...,n_k}\mu_i P_{ij}}{\sum_{h_1,...,h_k: \sum_{l=1}^k h_l = M-1} \pi(M)_{h_1,...,h_i+1,...,h_k} \mu_i P_{ij}}$$:p What is the probability that job $ x$ observes a specific state given the total number of jobs?
??x
The probability that job $x $ observes a specific state$(n_1, n_2, ..., n_k)$, where the sum of all states equals $ M-1$, is determined by comparing the rate of transitions to the total rate of transitions. This involves calculating the rates associated with the current state and normalizing it against all possible states that satisfy the given condition.
x??

---

#### Independence of $p_j $ from$M $ Background context explaining why the probability$p_j $ is independent of$M $. The key is to use the visit rate per job completion, denoted by$ V_j $, and the total job completion rate,$ X(M)$.
The formula given is:
$$p_j = \frac{\lambda_j (M)}{\lambda (M)} = \frac{X(M)V_j}{\sum_{k=1}^K X(M)V_k} = \frac{V_j}{\sum_{k=1}^K V_k}$$

This formula shows that $p_j $ is independent of$M$.
:p Why is $p_j $ independent of$M$?
??x
The probability $p_j $, which represents the fraction of visits to server $ j $, is independent of$ M $. This independence stems from the fact that it is calculated based on visit rates per job completion and the total rate of job completions, both of which are normalized across all servers. The formula for$ p_j $ shows that it depends only on the relative visit rates to server $ j$, making it independent of the system's overall number of jobs.
x??

---

#### Mean Response Time in Closed Networks
Background context explaining how the mean response time can be derived using Little’s Law and iterative methods. The key is understanding the relationship between $E[T(M)_{j}]$ and $E[T(M-1)_{j}]$.
The formula given is:
$$E\left[ T(M)_j \right] = 1/\mu_j + p_j \cdot \lambda(M-1)_j \cdot E\left[ T(M-1)_j \right]/\mu_j$$:p What is the expression for $ E[T(M)_{j}]$?
??x
The mean response time at server $j $ in a system with$M$ jobs can be expressed iteratively using:
$$E\left[ T(M)_j \right] = 1/\mu_j + p_j \cdot \lambda(M-1)_j \cdot E\left[ T(M-1)_j \right]/\mu_j$$

This formula uses the arrival theorem and Little’s Law to relate the current mean response time to the previous one, accounting for the proportion of jobs visiting server $j$ and the rate at which these jobs arrive.
x??

---

#### Iterative Derivation of Mean Response Time
Background context explaining how to iteratively derive the mean response time using the formula derived previously. The key is starting with a single job system to build up to more complex systems.
:p How do we start expressing $E[T(M)_{j}]$?
??x
We start by considering a simple case where there is only one job in the system:
$$E\left[ T(1)_j \right] = 1/\mu_j$$

This represents the mean service time at server $j$. Using this, we can derive the expression for multiple jobs iteratively.
x??

---

#### Constant C
Background context explaining how to determine the constant $C$ that normalizes the probability density. The key is understanding that this constant ensures the total probability sums to 1 across all possible states.
:p What is the role of the constant $C$?
??x
The constant $C $ plays a crucial role in ensuring that the derived probabilities sum to 1. It is determined by normalizing the expression for the probability over all possible states where$\sum_{k=1}^K n_k = M-1 $. The value of $ C $ is unique and independent of the specific state, allowing us to maintain a consistent probability distribution as $ M$ changes.
x??

---

#### Little's Law Application
Background context explaining how to apply Little's Law in queueing systems. This involves understanding the relationship between arrival rate, number of jobs, and average time spent by a job at a server.

:p How is Little's Law applied in this scenario?
??x
Little's Law states that the long-term average number of items $E[N]$ in a stable system is equal to the average customer arrival rate $λ$ multiplied by the average time an item spends in the system $E[T]$. Mathematically, it can be represented as:
$$E[N] = λ \times E[T]$$

In this specific problem, we are given that there are 3 jobs and two servers in a closed network. The service rate at the first server is μ=1, and the second server is twice as fast (μ2=2). We need to find the expected number of jobs at each server using Little's Law.

To apply it:
- Calculate $E[T]$ for both servers.
- Use the relationship between arrival rates and service rates.
- Apply the formula iteratively to determine the steady-state values.

Example: Given that there are 3 jobs, we can use the given service rates to find the expected number of jobs at each server.

```java
// Pseudocode for calculating E[T] for both servers
double lambda1 = 1.0 / 1; // Arrival rate to first server
double lambda2 = 1.0 / 2; // Arrival rate to second server

// Time spent in the system (Little's Law)
double ET1 = 1 / 1; // Time spent at first server
double ET2 = 1 / 2; // Time spent at second server

// Applying Little's Law
int N1 = lambda1 * ET1; // Number of jobs at first server
int N2 = lambda2 * ET2; // Number of jobs at second server
```

#### Recurrence Relation for Expected Time in System
Background context on deriving the recurrence relation for the expected time a job spends in the system using Mean Value Analysis (MVA). This involves breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and solving them iteratively.

:p How is the recurrence relation derived for $E[T(M)]$?
??x
The recurrence relation for $E[T(M)]$ can be derived by considering the contribution of each job to the total expected time spent in the system. The key idea is that the expected time spent at a server depends on the number of jobs and their service rates.

Given:
$$M - 1 = \sum_{j=1}^k E\left[ \frac{N(M-1)}{j} \right]$$

Using Little's Law, we can express $M - 1 $ in terms of arrival rate and expected time spent at the system. For a closed network with$M$ jobs:
$$M - 1 = \sum_{j=1}^k \lambda(M-1) E\left[ \frac{T(M-1)}{j} \right]$$

By applying Little's Law, we get:
$$\lambda(M-1) = \frac{M - 1}{\sum_{j=1}^k p_j E\left[ \frac{T(M-1)}{j} \right]}$$

This leads to the recurrence relation for $E[T(M)]$.

```java
// Pseudocode for deriving expected time in system using MVA
double lambda = (M - 1) / (sum of p_j * E[T(M-1)/j]);
```
x??

#### Example: MV A in a Closed System with Two Servers
Background context on applying Mean Value Analysis to a closed system with two servers where the second server is twice as fast. This involves calculating expected job counts at each server.

:p In an MVA example, how many jobs are expected at each of the two servers?
??x
In this example, we have a closed system with 2 servers in tandem, where the first server has a service rate μ=1 and the second server is twice as fast (μ2=2). Using Mean Value Analysis (MVA), we need to calculate the expected number of jobs at each server.

Given:
- M = 3 (total number of jobs)
- p1 = p2 = 0.5 (probability of a job going to either server)

Using the recurrence relations and Little's Law, we can derive:

```java
// Pseudocode for calculating expected number of jobs at each server
double lambda1 = 1; // Arrival rate to first server
double lambda2 = 1 / 2; // Arrival rate to second server

for (int M = 1; M <= 3; M++) {
    double lambdaM = (M - 1) / (0.5 * (5/3 + 11/14));
    double ET1 = 17/7; // Time spent at first server
    double ET2 = 11/14; // Time spent at second server

    int N1 = lambdaM * ET1;
    int N2 = lambdaM * ET2;

    System.out.println("Expected number of jobs at Server 1: " + N1);
    System.out.println("Expected number of jobs at Server 2: " + N2);
}
```

From the calculations, we find that:
- Expected number of jobs at the first server $N_1 $ is more than three times the expected number at the second server$N_2$.

The detailed steps for each iteration are as follows:

- For $M=3 $, calculate $\lambda(3)$ using equation (19.7).
- Use this to find $E[T(3)]$ for both servers.
- Finally, apply Little's Law to determine the expected number of jobs at each server.

Expected results:
- More than three jobs are expected at the first server.
x??

#### Expected Number of Jobs at Servers in a Closed Jackson Network

In this section, we are dealing with a closed queueing network where jobs circulate among servers. The objective is to find the expected number of jobs at each server when given different total numbers of jobs $M$.

For simplicity, consider a system with two servers and let's denote the state space as $(N_1, N_2)$, where $ N_i$represents the number of jobs at server $ i$. The transition rates between states are determined by the service rates and arrival rates.

Given:
- For $M = 3$, we have the following rates:
  - Transition rate from state $(1,2)$ to $(0,3)$:$ p_{(1,2)}^{(0,3)} = 3/7 \times 1/2 = 17/14 $- Transition rate from state$(1,2)$ to $(2,1)$:$ p_{(1,2)}^{(2,1)} = 6/7 \times 1/2 = 3/7$ The expected number of jobs at server 1 can be derived using the detailed balance equations.

:p How do you calculate the expected number of jobs at server 1 for $M=3$?
??x
To calculate the expected number of jobs at server 1, we need to use the transition rates and the service rates. For $M = 3$, we have:

- The total expected number of jobs in the system is given by:
$$E[N_1] + E[N_2] = M = 3$$

The detailed balance equations for a closed network can be derived from the transition probabilities.

For example, to find $E[N_1]$ for $M = 3$:

- The expected number of jobs at server 1 when there are 3 jobs in total is:
$$E[N_1] = \frac{17}{15}$$

This value can be derived from the balance equations and transition rates.

??x
The answer with detailed explanations.
To calculate $E[N_1]$ for $M=3$, we use the given transition rates and service rates. For a closed network, the expected number of jobs at each server is determined by balancing the probabilities of transitioning between states.

Given:
- Transition rate from $(1,2)$ to $(0,3)$:$ p_{(1,2)}^{(0,3)} = 3/7 \times 1/2 = 17/14 $- Transition rate from$(1,2)$ to $(2,1)$:$ p_{(1,2)}^{(2,1)} = 6/7 \times 1/2 = 3/7 $The expected number of jobs at server 1 can be derived using the detailed balance equations and transition rates. For$ M=3$, we have:

$$E[N_1] + E[N_2] = 3$$
$$

E[N_1] = \frac{17}{15}$$

This value is derived from the balance of probabilities in the network.

#### Multi-Class Product Form Networks (MV A)

The Matrix-Vector Approach (MV A) is a method used to find the normalizing constants for closed queueing networks. It has been extensively studied and applied in various contexts, including single-class and multi-class product form networks.

:p What are the key references for obtaining normalizing constants for closed queueing networks using MV A?
??x
Key references for obtaining normalizing constants for closed queueing networks using MV A include:
- [94]
- [72]
- [40]

MV A was developed by Reiser and Lavenberg [147] and is a powerful method for solving such networks, particularly those with single-class configurations. However, modifications are needed to handle think times and multiple classes.

??x
---

#### Closed Jackson Network

In this exercise, we need to derive the expected number of jobs at server 1 in a closed Jackson network given different total numbers of jobs $M$.

For a simple closed Jackson network with two servers:
- The system has a single class of jobs.
- Jobs arrive according to a Poisson process.

:p Derive the expected number of jobs at server 1 for $M = 3$ without using MV A.
??x
To derive the expected number of jobs at server 1 for $M = 3$:

- We know that in a closed network, the total expected number of jobs is $M = 3$.
- The detailed balance equations and transition rates can be used to find the distribution.

Given:
$$E[N_1] + E[N_2] = 3$$

Using the transition probabilities derived from the network:

For $M=3$:
- Expected number of jobs at server 1: $E[N_1] = \frac{17}{15}$ This value is calculated by balancing the probabilities and using the given transition rates.

#### Load-Dependent Service Rates in Open Jackson Networks

We need to solve for the limiting probabilities in an open Jackson network with load-dependent service rates, where jobs can arrive from a single class.

:p Derive the distribution of the number of jobs in the system when there is just one server.
??x
To derive the distribution of the number of jobs in the system with a single (FCFS) server and load-dependent service rates:

- Jobs arrive according to a Poisson process with rate $\lambda$.
- The service rate at the server is given by $\mu(n)$, which depends on the number of jobs $ n$ in the system.

The distribution can be derived using balance equations. Let's denote:
$$P_n = P(\text{number of jobs} = n)$$

Using the balance equations, we get a recurrence relation for $P_n$.

??x
---

#### Load-Dependent Service Rates in Open Jackson Networks (Cont.)

:p Derive the limiting probabilities using the local balance approach.
??x
To derive the limiting probabilities using the local balance approach:

1. State of the network: $(n_1, n_2, ..., n_k)$, where $ n_i$is the number of jobs at server $ i$.
2. Service rates at each server: $\mu_i(n_i)$.

The limiting probabilities can be found by solving the balance equations for each state.

For a network with load-dependent service rates:
$$π(n_1, n_2, ..., n_k) = P(\text{state} = (n_1, n_2, ..., n_k))$$

These probabilities will not be in closed form but can be solved using the local balance approach.

??x
---

#### Load-Dependent Service Rates in Open Jackson Networks (Product Form)

:p Prove that the limiting probabilities have a product form solution.
??x
To prove that the limiting probabilities have a product form solution:

Given:
$$π(n_1, n_2, ..., n_k) = \prod_{i=1}^k P(\text{Number of jobs at server } i \text{ is } n_i)$$

We can use the local balance approach to show that this product form holds.

For a network with load-dependent service rates:
$$π(n_1, n_2, ..., n_k) = \prod_{i=1}^k P(\text{Number of jobs at server } i \text{ is } n_i)$$

This solution can be checked by making the service rate constant at each server.

??x
---

#### M/M/m Servers in a Jackson Network

:p Derive the limiting probabilities for a Jackson network where each server is an $M/M/m$.
??x
To derive the limiting probabilities for a Jackson network with $M/M/m$ servers:

- Each server has multiple service channels.
- The arrival rate and service rates are constant.

The limiting probabilities can be derived using the theory of Markov chains and balance equations.

For an $M/M/m$ system:
$$π(n_1, n_2, ..., n_k) = \prod_{i=1}^k P(\text{Number of jobs at server } i \text{ is } n_i)$$

These probabilities can be solved using the M/M/m queueing model.

??x
---

#### Closed Interactive Jackson Networks

:p Explain how to analyze a closed interactive Jackson network with exponentially distributed think times.
??x
To analyze a closed interactive Jackson network with exponentially distributed think times:

1. Extend the analysis from closed batch Jackson networks to include think times.
2. Use the MV A method or similar approaches, modifying them for think times.

For a closed interactive network:
- Think time:$E[Z]$- Mean response time and throughput can be derived by extending the methods used in closed batch networks.

Specifically, mean response time and throughput can be calculated using the extended MV A approach.

#### Empirical Job Size Distributions
In computing workloads, job sizes are often characterized by heavy tails, very high variance, and a decreasing failure rate. These characteristics differ significantly from the Markovian (Exponential) distributions we have analyzed so far. The empirical analysis of such distributions is crucial for understanding real-world systems.
:p What are the key characteristics of job size distributions in computing workloads?
??x
The key characteristics include heavy tails, very high variance, and a decreasing failure rate. These features indicate that small jobs are frequent but large jobs can also occur with significant probability.

These characteristics differ from the Markovian (Exponential) distributions we have analyzed so far, which typically assume that job sizes follow an exponential distribution with constant parameters.
??x
The differences lie in the fact that heavy-tailed distributions imply a higher likelihood of extreme events (large jobs), whereas exponential distributions suggest a consistent probability for all job sizes. Understanding these differences is crucial for accurate modeling and analysis.

---
#### Phase-Type Distributions
Phase-type distributions are introduced to represent general distributions as mixtures of Exponential distributions, enabling the use of Markov chains in systems with more complex distributional assumptions.
:p How do phase-type distributions help in analyzing queueing systems?
??x
Phase-type distributions allow us to model a wide range of job size distributions by representing them as mixtures of Exponential distributions. This enables the use of Markov chain techniques, even when dealing with non-Markovian (non-Exponential) distributions.

This approach is particularly useful because it allows us to leverage the powerful tools and methods developed for Markov chains while accommodating more realistic job size distributions in queueing systems.
??x
For example, consider a queue where job sizes can be modeled using a phase-type distribution. We could represent this as a mixture of Exponential distributions with different rates:

```java
public class PhaseTypeDistribution {
    private double[] probabilities;
    private double[] rates;

    public PhaseTypeDistribution(double[] probs, double[] rates) {
        // Initialize the probabilities and rates arrays
    }

    public double probabilityOfState(int state) {
        return probabilities[state];
    }

    public double serviceTime() {
        int state = randomChoice(probabilities);
        return Exponential.randomFromRate(rates[state]);
    }
}
```

Here, `randomChoice` is a method that returns the index of an element chosen based on the given probabilities array. The `serviceTime` method simulates the service time by selecting one of the Exponential distributions according to their respective rates.
??x
The code example demonstrates how phase-type distributions can be used in practice. By representing the distribution as a mixture of Exponentials, we can simulate and analyze systems with more realistic job size distributions using Markov chain techniques.

---
#### Matrix-Analytic Techniques
Matrix-analytic techniques are introduced for solving Markov chains resulting from general distributions, which often have no simple solutions.
:p What is the purpose of matrix-analytic techniques in queueing analysis?
??x
Matrix-analytic techniques provide efficient and highly accurate methods to solve Markov chains that arise when dealing with general job size distributions. These techniques are particularly useful because many real-world systems exhibit non-Markovian behavior, meaning their future states depend on a history of past events.

Matrix-analytic methods enable the analysis of complex queueing models by breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts using matrix representations.
??x
Matrix-analytic techniques involve representing the Markov chain as a system of linear equations and solving them numerically. For example:

```java
public class MatrixAnalyticSolver {
    private double[][] Q; // Transition rate matrix

    public MatrixAnalyticSolver(double[][] q) {
        this.Q = q;
    }

    public double[] steadyStateProbabilities() {
        // Implement the algorithm to find steady-state probabilities using matrix methods
        return new double[0];
    }
}
```

The `steadyStateProbabilities` method uses advanced linear algebra techniques to solve for the steady-state distribution of the Markov chain, providing insights into long-term behavior.
??x
Matrix-analytic methods are powerful because they allow us to handle complex systems with non-Markovian properties. The code example shows a basic structure for implementing such solvers, highlighting the use of matrix algebra to find steady-state probabilities.

#### Processor-Sharing (PS) Servers and BCMP Theorem
Chapter 22 introduces networks of PS servers where job sizes are generally distributed. The BCMP theorem is used to analyze these networks, providing a simple closed-form solution for systems with PS servers.
:p What does the BCMP theorem offer in the context of PS server networks?
??x
The BCMP (Baskett-Chandy-Muntz-Premambore) theorem offers a simple closed-form solution for analyzing networks of Processor-Sharing (PS) servers where job sizes are generally distributed. This is particularly useful because PS scheduling allows multiple jobs to share the processing power, making it challenging to analyze using traditional Markovian methods.
??x
The BCMP theorem simplifies the analysis by providing an elegant product form solution that applies when the service discipline at each server can be represented as a Phase-Type distribution or other specific forms. This makes it possible to derive performance metrics such as queue lengths and waiting times in a straightforward manner.

Here’s a simplified version of how the BCMP theorem might be applied:

```java
public class BcmpTheoremApplicator {
    private double[][] serviceRates; // Rates for each server

    public BcmpTheoremApplicator(double[] rates) {
        this.serviceRates = new double[rates.length][rates.length];
        populateMatrix(rates);
    }

    private void populateMatrix(double[] rates) {
        // Populate the matrix based on the input rates
    }

    public double[] throughputAnalysis() {
        // Implement BCMP theorem logic to find throughput
        return new double[0];
    }
}
```

The `throughputAnalysis` method encapsulates the logic for applying the BCMP theorem, which involves constructing a specific type of matrix and solving it to determine system performance metrics.
??x
Matrix construction and solution are key steps in applying the BCMP theorem. The code example outlines a basic structure, showing how service rates can be used to set up the necessary matrices.

#### Pollaczek-Khinchin (P-K) Formula
Chapter 23 introduces the tagged-job technique, leading to the P-K formula for calculating mean delay in an M/G/1 FCFS queue.
:p What is the significance of the P-K formula?
??x
The P-K formula provides a simple and elegant solution for calculating the mean delay in an M/G/1 FCFS (First-Come-First-Served) queue. This formula is significant because it allows us to analyze complex systems with generally distributed job sizes, which are common in real-world applications.
??x
The P-K formula is given by:
$$E[D] = \frac{E[S]}{\lambda(1 - \rho)} + \frac{2\sigma^2}{3\lambda}$$

Where:
- $E[S]$ is the mean service time,
- $\lambda$ is the arrival rate,
- $\rho = \frac{\lambda E[S]}{E[S]}$ is the traffic intensity,
- $\sigma^2$ is the variance of the service time.

This formula simplifies the analysis of M/G/1 systems and provides a straightforward way to estimate mean delay without requiring detailed simulations.

Here’s an example of how to use the P-K formula in Java:

```java
public class PollaczekKhinchinFormula {
    private double arrivalRate;
    private double serviceMean;
    private double serviceVariance;

    public PollaczekKhinchinFormula(double lambda, double E_S, double sigma2) {
        this.arrivalRate = lambda;
        this.serviceMean = E_S;
        this.serviceVariance = sigma2;
    }

    public double meanDelay() {
        double rho = arrivalRate * serviceMean;
        return (serviceMean / (1 - rho)) + (2 * serviceVariance) / (3 * arrivalRate);
    }
}
```

The `meanDelay` method implements the P-K formula to calculate the expected delay in an M/G/1 FCFS queue.

The code example demonstrates how to apply the P-K formula in a practical setting, making it easy to compute mean delays for systems with generally distributed job sizes.
