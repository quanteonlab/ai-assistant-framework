#### Task Assignment Policies for Server Farms Among Worst Performers

Background context: The text discusses task assignment policies for server farms that are among the worst performers, particularly focusing on those with PS (Preemptive Shortest) servers. It mentions that job size variability is not a significant issue in these scenarios and highlights JSQ (Join the shortest queue) as nearly insensitive to such variability.

:p What are the characteristics of task assignment policies for server farms with PS servers?
??x
Task assignment policies for server farms with PS servers are less sensitive to job size variability, making them effective even when job sizes vary significantly. The policy JSQ, in particular, performs well due to its ability to adapt quickly to varying workloads without being heavily impacted by job size differences.

#### Optimal Server Farm Design

Background context: This section introduces the theoretical question of optimally designing a server farm, considering both task assignment and scheduling policies at individual hosts. It assumes fully preemptible jobs and known job sizes upon arrival, allowing for flexibility in having a central queue if needed.

:p What assumptions are made about jobs in optimal server farm design?
??x
Jobs are assumed to be fully preemptible and their sizes are known when they arrive. The system also allows for the possibility of using a central queue at the router.

#### Competitive Ratio in Worst-Case Analysis

Background context: In worst-case analysis, policies are evaluated against an ideal policy (OPT) that can handle any possible arrival sequence optimally. The competitive ratio is used to compare the performance of different policies across all possible scenarios.

:p What does the competitive ratio measure in worst-case analysis?
??x
The competitive ratio measures how well a given policy performs compared to the optimal policy (OPT) under any possible arrival sequence. A higher competitive ratio indicates worse performance since it means the policy is not as effective as the best possible solution for every scenario.
x??

---

#### Stochastic Analysis vs. Worst-Case Analysis

Background context: The text contrasts stochastic analysis, which typically looks at average-case performance under certain job size distributions and Poisson arrival processes, with worst-case analysis, where policies are evaluated across all possible sequences.

:p How does worst-case analysis differ from stochastic analysis in server farm design?
??x
Worst-case analysis evaluates policies against an optimal policy (OPT) that can handle any possible arrival sequence optimally. In contrast, stochastic analysis typically looks at average performance under certain assumptions about job sizes and arrivals, such as a Poisson process with i.i.d. job sizes.

Stochastic analysis is more concerned with the expected behavior of a policy given statistical properties of jobs and arrivals, while worst-case analysis considers the best possible performance across all scenarios.

#### Example of Competitive Ratio Calculation

Background context: The competitive ratio quantifies how well a policy performs compared to the optimal policy. It involves evaluating policies on each possible arrival sequence and comparing their expected response times.

:p How is the competitive ratio calculated for a given policy?
??x
The competitive ratio for a given policy $P $ is calculated by considering all possible arrival sequences$A $. For each sequence, the ratio of the expected response time under policy$ P$to that under the optimal policy OPT is computed. The competitive ratio is then defined as:
$$\text{Competitive Ratio} = \max_A r_P(A) = \max_A \frac{\mathbb{E}[T(P, A)]}{\mathbb{E}[T(OPT, A)]}$$

Where $r_P(A)$ is the ratio of the expected response time under policy $ P $ to that under OPT for a given arrival sequence $A$.

#### SRPT Policy for Single Queue
Background context: The Shortest Remaining Processing Time (SRPT) policy is known to be optimal with respect to mean response time for a single queue, even under any arrival sequence of job sizes and times. This result was first proved by Coffman et al. in [159].
:p What is the SRPT policy, and why is it considered optimal?
??x
The SRPT policy always runs the job with the shortest remaining processing time preemptively. This ensures that shorter jobs are completed faster on average, leading to minimal mean response times. The optimality of this policy has been proven for a single queue regardless of the arrival sequence.
```java
public class SRPTPolicy {
    public void scheduleJob(int jobSize) {
        // Schedule the job with the shortest remaining processing time
        if (jobQueue.isEmpty() || jobSize < nextJob.getRemainingTime()) {
            nextJob = new Job(jobSize);
        }
    }
}
```
x??
---

#### Central-Queue-SRPT Policy for Server Farms
Background context: The Central-Queue-SRPT policy extends the SRPT concept to a server farm by serving jobs in an SRPT order from a central queue. Each of the k servers works on the job with the shortest remaining processing time at any given moment.
:p What is the Central-Queue-SRPT policy, and how does it work?
??x
The Central-Queue-SRPT policy involves maintaining a central queue where jobs are ordered by their remaining processing times. At every moment, each of the k servers works on the job with the shortest remaining time in its queue. If an incoming job has a shorter remaining time than the current job being served at a server, it is immediately assigned to that server, and the previous job is requeued.
```java
public class CentralQueueSRPTPolicy {
    public void scheduleJob(Job job) {
        // Assign the job to the server with the shortest remaining processing time in its queue
        for (Server server : servers) {
            if (server.isAvailable() && (job.getRemainingTime() < server.getCurrentTask().getRemainingTime())) {
                server.assignJob(job);
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Optimality and Worst-Case Analysis of Central-Queue-SRPT
Background context: While the SRPT policy is optimal for a single queue, the Central-Queue-SRPT policy does not guarantee optimality in every arrival sequence. A counterexample exists where another algorithm can achieve better performance.
:p Does Central-Queue-SRPT minimize E[T] on all arrival sequences?
??x
Sadly, no. The Central-Queue-SRPT policy is not optimal in the worst-case sense because there are specific arrival sequences (e.g., the example provided with 2-server system) where another algorithm can achieve a lower mean response time.
```java
public class OptimalAlgorithm {
    public void scheduleJobs(List<Job> jobs, List<Server> servers) {
        // The optimal algorithm packs jobs to maximize server utilization at all times
        for (int i = 0; i < jobs.size(); i += 2) {
            Job job1 = jobs.get(i);
            Job job2 = jobs.get(i + 1);
            Server serverA = servers.get(0);
            Server serverB = servers.get(1);

            // Schedule the jobs optimally to maximize utilization
            if (job1.getRemainingTime() < job2.getRemainingTime()) {
                serverA.assignJob(job1);
                serverB.assignJob(job2);
            } else {
                serverA.assignJob(job2);
                serverB.assignJob(job1);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Central-Queue-SRPT Algorithm Behavior
Background context: The passage describes how the Central-Queue-SRPT algorithm handles job scheduling on a server farm with two servers. It discusses the inefficiencies of this approach, particularly in terms of server utilization and job completion times.

:p How does Central-Queue-SRPT handle the arrival sequence described in the text?
??x
Central-Queue-SRPT tries to prioritize jobs based on their remaining time by running smaller jobs first, but it fails to fully utilize both servers. For example, at time 0, it attempts to run two small jobs of size 29 on each server simultaneously, leaving one job of size 210 idle. This approach results in the need for preemption and underutilization of resources.

Example:
```java
public class CentralQueueSRPT {
    public void scheduleJobs(List<Job> jobs) {
        // Logic to run smallest remaining time jobs first on both servers
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Wasted Resources with Central-Queue-SRPT
Background context: The text highlights that although the worst-case competitive ratio of Central-Queue-SRPT is not optimal, it can still be effective under certain conditions. However, in the example given, it shows how resource wastage occurs due to poor job packing and scheduling.

:p What are the main issues with using Central-Queue-SRPT as described?
??x
Central-Queue-SRPT packs jobs poorly, leading to one server being idle while another is running multiple smaller jobs. This results in insufficient time for larger jobs to complete before new batches arrive, causing preemption and underutilization of resources.

Example:
```java
public class JobScheduling {
    public void scheduleJobs(List<Job> jobs) {
        // Poor job packing logic leading to resource wastage
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Optimal Server Farm Design with SRPT Scheduling at Hosts
Background context: The text suggests that for server farms where immediate dispatch is required, SRPT scheduling at the individual hosts can be optimal. This approach ensures short jobs are spread out over all servers to maximize efficiency.

:p What advantage does running SRPT on each host offer in a server farm?
??x
Running SRPT on each host allows short jobs to be dispatched immediately and processed quickly, ensuring that no single host is overloaded with small jobs while others remain idle. This approach maximizes the effectiveness of SRPT by distributing short jobs evenly across all servers.

Example:
```java
public class HostSRPT {
    public void scheduleJobsOnHosts(List<Job> jobs) {
        // Logic to distribute jobs based on SRPT at each host
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Immediate Dispatch and Task Assignment Policy
Background context: The text discusses the importance of immediate dispatch in server farms, particularly for web servers where quick response times are critical. It introduces the IMD (Immediate Dispatch and Maximal Short Jobs Distribution) algorithm as a method to spread short jobs across multiple SRPT-scheduled hosts.

:p What is the IMD task assignment policy?
??x
IMD assigns each incoming job to the host with the smallest number of jobs in its size class, ensuring that all servers are working on getting as many short jobs out as possible. This approach helps prevent any single server from becoming a bottleneck due to an overload of small jobs.

Example:
```java
public class IMDTaskAssignment {
    public int assignJobToHost(List<Job> jobs) {
        // Logic to find the host with minimal number of jobs in the same size class
        return minLoadHost;
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Competitiveness and Optimal Policies
Background context: The text mentions that while Central-Queue-SRPT has a good worst-case competitive ratio, no online algorithm can improve on this ratio by more than a constant factor. It also notes the lack of analysis for stochastic scenarios.

:p What does the worst-case competitive ratio tell us about an algorithm?
??x
The worst-case competitive ratio provides a measure of how well an online algorithm performs relative to the optimal offline solution in the worst possible scenario. For Central-Queue-SRPT, this ratio is proportional to $\log\left(\frac{b}{s}\right)$, where $ b$is the largest job size and $ s$ is the smallest job size.

Example:
```java
public class CompetitiveRatio {
    public double calculateCR(int b, int s) {
        return Math.log(b / s);
    }
}
```
x??

#### Open Problems in Queueing Theory
Background context: The passage outlines some of the open problems related to analyzing algorithms like Central-Queue-SRPT from a stochastic perspective and optimal task assignment under immediate dispatch constraints.

:p What are some of the key open problems mentioned?
??x
Some key open problems include:
1. Analyzing Central-Queue-SRPT stochastically, especially with Poisson arrivals and exponentially distributed job sizes.
2. Determining an optimal policy for immediate task assignment in server farms that maximizes resource utilization and minimizes response times.

Example:
```java
public class OpenProblems {
    public void analyzeOpenProblems() {
        // Logic to identify open problems in queueing theory
    }
}
```

#### Size-Based Task Assignment (SITA) and Its Variants for Server Farms

Background context: The SITA policy was introduced by Harchol-Balter, Crovella, and Murta to address job size variability in server farms. It involves assigning jobs based on their sizes, which can significantly reduce the variability of job completion times.

:p What is SITA and why is it important for high job size variability?

??x
SITA stands for Size-Based Task Assignment. It is a policy designed to manage task assignment in server farms where job sizes vary widely. The key idea behind SITA is that jobs are assigned based on their size, which can help reduce the variability in job completion times and improve overall performance.

The importance of SITA lies in its effectiveness under high job size variability. Many studies have shown that for highly variable job sizes, SITA outperforms other policies like LWL (Last Work Last In) with respect to mean response time [32,41,50,65,82,83,134,172,177]. However, recent research by [90] has shown that in certain scenarios and job size distributions, SITA can actually be inferior to LWL.

??x
The answer with detailed explanations.
```java
// Example of a simplified SITA policy implementation
public class SitaPolicy {
    private Map<JobSize, Server> serverAssignment;

    public void assignTask(JobSize job) {
        // Assign the job based on its size to an appropriate server
        for (Map.Entry<JobSize, Server> entry : serverAssignment.entrySet()) {
            if (job.getSize() <= entry.getKey().getSize()) {
                entry.getValue().assign(job);
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    public void reAssignTasks(List<JobSize> updatedJobs) {
        // Re-allocate tasks based on changes in job sizes
        for (JobSize job : updatedJobs) {
            assignTask(job); // Ensure each job is assigned correctly according to its size
        }
    }
}
```
The logic of the SITA policy implementation involves assigning jobs to servers that can handle their specific size. This ensures that smaller jobs are more likely to be handled by faster or less busy servers, reducing overall waiting times and improving system efficiency.

x??

#### Hybrid Policy for Server Farms

Background context: The Hybrid policy is a variant of SITA introduced in [91] that combines the benefits of both SITA and LWL. In this setup, one server only serves small jobs while another can handle any job size.

:p What is the Hybrid policy and how does it differ from traditional SITA?

??x
The Hybrid policy is a variant introduced to leverage the strengths of both SITA (Size-Based Task Assignment) and LWL (Last Work Last In). It involves setting up a server farm where one server only serves small jobs, while another can handle any job size. This hybrid approach aims to address the limitations of pure SITA under certain conditions.

The key difference is that Hybrid reduces the variability in task processing by separating small jobs from larger ones, potentially leading to better performance compared to traditional SITA in some scenarios.

??x
The answer with detailed explanations.
```java
// Example of a simplified Hybrid policy implementation
public class HybridPolicy {
    private Server smallJobsServer;
    private Server anyJobServer;

    public void assignTask(JobSize job) {
        if (job.getSize() <= SMALL_JOB_THRESHOLD) {
            smallJobsServer.assign(job);
        } else {
            anyJobServer.assign(job);
        }
    }

    public void reAssignTasks(List<JobSize> updatedJobs) {
        // Re-allocate tasks based on changes in job sizes
        for (JobSize job : updatedJobs) {
            assignTask(job); // Ensure each job is assigned correctly according to its size and type
        }
    }
}

// Constants or configuration settings
private static final int SMALL_JOB_THRESHOLD = 50; // Example threshold value

```
The Hybrid policy implementation involves separating small jobs from larger ones, assigning them to different servers based on their size. This approach aims to balance the benefits of both SITA and LWL by reducing the variability in task processing times.

#### Mean Response Time for M/G/k and G/G/k Systems

Background context: The mean response time for systems with M/G/k or G/G/k queues remains an open problem in queueing theory. Traditional approximations often rely on only the first two moments of the job size distribution, which may be insufficient.

:p What challenges are there in calculating the mean response time for M/G/k and G/G/k systems?

??x
Calculating the mean response time for M/G/k and G/G/k systems remains an open problem due to the complexity introduced by the variability in job sizes. Traditional approximations often rely on only the first two moments of the job size distribution, which may not be sufficient.

The main challenges include:
1. **High Variability**: Job sizes can vary significantly, making it difficult to accurately predict response times.
2. **Lack of Closed-Form Solutions**: There are no exact closed-form solutions for these systems, leading to reliance on approximations that often lack accuracy and generality.
3. **Resource Requirement (R)**: The upper bound on mean delay in G/G/k systems does not depend on the variance but only up to a certain moment [156,155].

??x
The answer with detailed explanations.
```java
// Example of an approximation for M/G/k or G/G/k using Lee and Longton's method
public class MeanResponseTimeApproximation {
    private double meanServiceTime;
    private int numberOfServers;

    public double approximateMeanResponseTime(double meanJobSize, double variance) {
        // Using the Lee and Longton approximation: T ≈ (meanJobSize / numberOfServers) * (1 + (variance / 2))
        return (meanJobSize / numberOfServers) * (1 + (variance / 2));
    }
}

// Constants or configuration settings
private static final double MEAN_JOB_SIZE = 10.0; // Example mean job size
private static final int NUMBER_OF_SERVERS = 5;   // Example number of servers

```
The Lee and Longton approximation provides a simple yet approximate method to estimate the mean response time, but it relies on limited moments (mean and variance) and may not be accurate for highly variable job sizes.

#### JSQ Policy in Server Farms with FCFS Scheduling

Background context: The Join-the-Shortest-Queue (JSQ) policy is widely used for server farms with FCFS scheduling. However, its performance can degrade significantly under high job size variability and non-decreasing failure rates.

:p What are the challenges of using JSQ in server farms with highly variable job sizes?

??x
Using the Join-the-Shortest-Queue (JSQ) policy in server farms with FCFS scheduling faces significant challenges, especially when job sizes are highly variable. The main issues include:
1. **Inefficiency**: JSQ can lead to longer waiting times for jobs because it does not account for the variability in service times.
2. **Approximations and Truncations**: Most analyses of JSQ rely on approximations that may be inaccurate, especially when k > 2 servers are involved.

??x
The answer with detailed explanations.
```java
// Example of a simplified JSQ policy implementation with approximation
public class JsqPolicy {
    private List<Server> servers;

    public void assignTask(JobSize job) {
        int bestQueueIndex = -1;
        double minWaitingTime = Double.MAX_VALUE;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < servers.size(); i++) {
            double waitingTime = estimateWaitingTime(job, servers.get(i));
            if (waitingTime < minWaitingTime) {
                minWaitingTime = waitingTime;
                bestQueueIndex = i;
            }
        }

        // Assign the job to the queue with the minimum estimated waiting time
        servers.get(bestQueueIndex).assign(job);
    }

    private double estimateWaitingTime(JobSize job, Server server) {
        // Approximate waiting time based on job size and server characteristics
        return (job.getSize() / server.getAverageServiceRate());
    }
}

// Constants or configuration settings
private static final List<Server> SERVERS = new ArrayList<>(); // Example list of servers

```
The JSQ policy implementation involves estimating the waiting times for each server before assigning a job. However, this approach can be inaccurate due to approximations and truncations, leading to suboptimal performance.

#### Upper Bounds on Mean Delay in G/G/k Systems

Background context: Scheller-Wolf and Sigman [156, 155] have proven an upper bound on the mean delay in a G/G/k system that does not depend on higher moments of service time. This result is significant for understanding the behavior of highly variable job sizes.

:p What are the key findings regarding upper bounds on mean delay in G/G/k systems?

??x
The key findings regarding upper bounds on mean delay in G/G/k systems include:
1. **Upper Bound Independence**: The upper bound does not depend on any moment higher than the $(k+1)^{th}$ moment, and it particularly does not depend on the variance of job size [156, 155].
2. **Resource Requirement (R)**: For $R < \left\lfloor \frac{k}{2} \right\rfloor $, where $ R = k\rho$, this result holds.
3. **Generalization**: The upper bound is generalized to allow for higher load, $R < k - 1$ [156].

??x
The answer with detailed explanations.
```java
// Example of a simplified upper bound calculation
public class UpperBoundCalculator {
    private int numberOfServers;
    private double resourceRequirement;

    public double calculateUpperBound(double meanJobSize, double variance) {
        // Upper bound formula: T ≤ (meanJobSize / numberOfServers) * (1 + (variance / 2))
        return (meanJobSize / numberOfServers) * (1 + (variance / 2));
    }

    public boolean isValidResourceRequirement(double loadFactor) {
        double R = loadFactor * numberOfServers;
        return R < Math.floor(numberOfServers / 2.0);
    }
}

// Constants or configuration settings
private static final int NUM_SERVERS = 5; // Example number of servers
private static final double LOAD_FACTOR = 1.5; // Example load factor

```
The upper bound calculation provides a theoretical limit on the mean delay in G/G/k systems, which is particularly useful for understanding system behavior under high job size variability and different resource requirements.

#### Server Farm with Size-Interval-Task-Assignment
Background context: The problem involves a server farm with two identical FCFS hosts, where job sizes follow a power-law distribution. Jobs are routed based on their size to either the first or second server.

:p Derive the mean response time, E[T], for this system.
??x
To derive the mean response time $E[T]$ in this system, we need to consider both routing and service times. The job sizes follow a power-law distribution given by:
$$P\{S > x\} = x^{-2.5}$$for $1 \leq x < \infty$.

- **Routing Rule**: Small jobs ($S < 10 $) are routed to the first server, and large jobs ($ S \geq 10$) are routed to the second server.
- **Service Times**: Assume service times are exponentially distributed with rate $\mu$ for simplicity.

The mean response time $E[T]$ can be derived by considering the routing probabilities and average service times at each server. Let's denote:
- The fraction of small jobs as $p_s $, and large jobs as $1 - p_s$.
- Small job size distribution: $\text{Poisson}(10)$.

The mean response time can be calculated using Little's Law for both servers, combining routing probabilities and service times.

```java
public class ServerFarmResponseTime {
    public double calculateMeanResponseTime(double lambda, double mu) {
        // Calculate the fraction of small jobs
        double pS = 10.0 / (10 + 9.0); // Simplification for large job sizes
        double pL = 1 - pS;

        // Mean service time at each server
        double meanServiceTimeSmall = 1 / mu;
        double meanServiceTimeLarge = 1 / mu;

        // Mean response time calculation (simplified)
        return lambda * (pS * meanServiceTimeSmall + pL * meanServiceTimeLarge);
    }
}
```

#### PS Server Farm
Background context: This problem considers a server farm with two identical PS hosts and SITA task assignment. The goal is to prove that the cutoff which minimizes mean response time balances load between the servers.

:p Prove that the SITA cutoff which minimizes mean response time is that which balances load between the two hosts.
??x
To minimize the mean response time in a server farm with PS hosts and SITA task assignment, we need to show that balancing the load across both hosts results in the minimum $E[T]$.

- **SITA (Size Interval Task Assignment)**: Jobs are routed based on their size intervals.
- **PS (Processor Sharing)**: Each job sees all servers as a single server with an effective service rate.

Assume the job sizes follow some distribution, and let $\rho$ represent the load. The key idea is to use the balance between small and large jobs to ensure efficient processing.

The mean response time $E[T]$ can be expressed using Little's Law:
$$E[T] = \frac{\rho}{\mu} + D$$where $ D$ depends on the distribution of job sizes and their routing. By balancing load, we minimize the impact of job size variability and ensure efficient use of resources.

```java
public class PSFServerFarm {
    public double calculateMeanResponseTime(double lambda, double mu) {
        // Load balancing condition: λ/μ = 0.5 for two hosts
        return (lambda / (2 * mu)) + 1; // Simplified formula assuming balanced load
    }
}
```

#### Hybrid Server Farm
Background context: The problem involves a server farm with two identical hosts, where small jobs are scheduled FCFS on the first host and large jobs on the second using PS. Load is balanced such that each host handles an equal amount of work.

:p Write an expression for $E[T]$, the mean response time experienced by an arriving job.
??x
To derive the mean response time $E[T]$ in this hybrid server farm setup, we need to consider both the routing and service times. Let's denote:
- The probability density function (pdf) of job sizes as $f_S(t)$.
- The cumulative distribution function (cdf) of job sizes as $F_S(t) = P\{S < t\}$.

Given that small jobs ($S < 10 $) go to the first server and large jobs ($ S \geq 10 $) go to the second, we can express$ E[T]$ as:
$$E[T] = p_s \cdot E[T_1] + (1 - p_s) \cdot E[T_2]$$where:
- $p_s$ is the probability that a job size is less than 10.
- $E[T_1]$ and $E[T_2]$ are the mean response times at the first and second servers, respectively.

```java
public class HybridServerFarm {
    public double calculateMeanResponseTime(double lambda, double mu) {
        // Load balancing condition: ρ = 0.5 for two hosts
        double pS = 10 / (10 + 9); // Fraction of small jobs
        double E_T1 = 1 / (2 * mu); // Mean service time at first server
        double E_T2 = 1 / mu;       // Mean service time at second server

        return lambda * (pS * E_T1 + (1 - pS) * E_T2);
    }
}
```

#### Equivalence of LWL and M/G/k
Background context: This problem explores the equivalence between Last-Worst-Least (LWL) and an $M/G/k$ system, where both systems process the same job sequence.

:p Prove by induction that each job is served by the same server in both systems.
??x
To prove that each job is served by the same server in both LWL and M/G/k systems, we can use mathematical induction. Assume that all jobs up to time $n$ are served correctly in both systems.

- **Base Case**: For $n = 1$, check if the first job is assigned to the correct server.
- **Inductive Step**: Assume for some $k $, all jobs from 1 to $ k $are correctly assigned. Show that the$(k+1)$-th job is also correctly assigned.

If both systems use the same tie-breaking rules and process the same sequence, they will serve the jobs in the exact same manner.

```java
public class EquivalenceProof {
    public boolean checkEquivalence() {
        // Assuming identical processing sequences and rules
        return true;
    }
}
```

#### One Fast Machine versus Two Slow Ones
Background context: This problem compares the performance of one fast machine with two slow ones, where job sizes are not exponentially distributed.

:p Which architecture (one fast or two slow) is superior when the job size distribution is heavy-tailed?
??x
To determine which architecture is better for a heavy-tailed job size distribution:

- **One Fast Machine**: $M/G/1$- **Two Slow Machines**: Split jobs into small and large, where small go to one machine and large to another.

For a heavy-tailed distribution:
- Small jobs (0.01 seconds) on the slow machine.
- Large jobs (1 second) on the slow machine.

The mean waiting time $E[T_Q]$ can be computed as follows:
$$E[T_Q] = \frac{\lambda}{\mu} + \text{other terms}$$

For a single fast machine:
$$

E[T_{Q,1}] = \frac{\lambda E[S]}{\mu} + \text{other terms}$$

For two slow machines:
$$

E[T_{Q,2}] = 2 \cdot \left( \frac{\lambda (0.01) + \lambda (1)}{2\mu} \right) + \text{other terms}$$

By comparing the waiting times, we can determine which architecture is better.

```java
public class FastVsSlow {
    public double computeWaitingTime(double lambda, double mu) {
        // Compute E[T_Q] for both architectures and compare
        return Math.min(lambda * (0.01 + 1) / (2 * mu), lambda * 3000 / mu);
    }
}
```

#### To Balance Load or Not to Balance Load?
Background context: This problem explores whether load balancing between two identical FCFS hosts is always beneficial for minimizing $E[T_Q]$.

:p Determine the cutoff under SITA-E and its impact on mean delay.
??x
To determine the optimal cutoff under SITA-E, we need to balance the load at both servers. Given:
- System load $\rho = 0.5$.
- Bounded Pareto job size distribution with mean 3000.

The cutoff $x$ balances the load such that each server handles half of the traffic.

The mean response time can be computed using:
$$E[T] = p_s \cdot \frac{1}{2\mu} + (1 - p_s) \cdot \frac{1}{\mu}$$where $ p_s$ is the fraction of small jobs.

```java
public class LoadBalancing {
    public double calculateMeanResponseTime(double lambda, double mu) {
        // Cutoff and load balancing condition: ρ = 0.5
        double pS = 1 - (3000 / 4000); // Fraction of small jobs
        double E_T1 = 1 / (2 * mu);     // Mean service time at first server
        double E_T2 = 1 / mu;           // Mean service time at second server

        return lambda * (pS * E_T1 + (1 - pS) * E_T2);
    }
}
```

#### Hybrid Server Farm with Different Descriptions
Background context: This problem focuses on a hybrid server farm setup, but includes specific details to differentiate it from previous descriptions.

:p Write an expression for $E[T]$ in this specific hybrid scenario.
??x
To derive the mean response time $E[T]$ for this specific hybrid server farm:
- Small jobs ($S < 10$) are scheduled FCFS on the first server.
- Large jobs ($S \geq 10$) use PS on the second server.

The mean response time can be expressed as:
$$E[T] = p_s \cdot E[T_1] + (1 - p_s) \cdot E[T_2]$$where:
- $p_s$ is the probability that a job size is less than 10.
- $E[T_1]$ and $E[T_2]$ are the mean response times at the first and second servers, respectively.

```java
public class SpecificHybridServerFarm {
    public double calculateMeanResponseTime(double lambda, double mu) {
        // Load balancing condition: ρ = 0.5 for two hosts
        double pS = 10 / (10 + 9); // Fraction of small jobs
        double E_T1 = 1 / (2 * mu); // Mean service time at first server
        double E_T2 = 1 / mu;       // Mean service time at second server

        return lambda * (pS * E_T1 + (1 - pS) * E_T2);
    }
}
```
