#### Coast Guard Enlisted Jobs Overview
The Coast Guard, part of the Department of Homeland Security, uses ASVAB subtest scores for job qualification purposes. Unlike other military branches that use line scores, the Coast Guard sums various ASVAB subtests to determine eligibility for specific jobs.
