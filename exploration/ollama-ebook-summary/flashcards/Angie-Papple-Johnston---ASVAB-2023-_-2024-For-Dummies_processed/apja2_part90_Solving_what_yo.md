#### 15. Price Increase Calculation

**Background Context:**
Mr. Cameron purchased a shirt for $20 and sold it for$26. We need to calculate the percentage increase in the price of the shirt.

Relevant Formula:
Percentage Increase = (Increase in Price / Original Price) × 100%

:p By what percentage did Mr. Cameron increase the price?
??x
First, find the increase in price:

Increase in Price = Selling Price - Purchase Price
                 = $26 -$20
                 = $6

Now calculate the percentage increase:

Percentage Increase = ($6 /$20) × 100%
                    = 0.30 × 100%
                    = 30%

Therefore, Mr. Cameron increased the price by $30$%.
??x
The answer is $30 \%$.

We need to find out how many hours per day are spent on discretionary time.

Relevant Formula:
Discretionary Time = 1 - (Sum of other times)

:p How many hours per day does this discretionary time amount to?
??x
First, calculate the sum of all allocated times:

Sleeping and Eating: $\frac{1}{4}$ Standing at Attention:$\frac{1}{12}$ Exercising:$\frac{1}{6}$ Working:$\frac{2}{5}$ Sum =$\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{12} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{2}{5}$ To add these fractions, find a common denominator (which is 60):$\frac{15}{60} + \frac{5}{60} + \frac{10}{60} + \frac{24}{60} = \frac{54}{60}$ Simplify the sum:$\frac{54}{60} = \frac{9}{10}$ Now, find the discretionary time by subtracting this from 1 (which is 1/1):

Discretionary Time =$1 - \frac{9}{10} = \frac{1}{10}$ of a day

Convert to hours:$\frac{1}{10} \times 24 \text{ hours} = 2.4 \text{ hours}$ Therefore, the discretionary time is $ 2.4 $ hours per day.
??x
The answer is $2.4$ hours.
