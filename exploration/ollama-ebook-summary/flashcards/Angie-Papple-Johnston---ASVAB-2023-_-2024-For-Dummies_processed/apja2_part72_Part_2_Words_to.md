#### Prefixes, Suffixes, and Roots
Understanding prefixes, suffixes, and roots is crucial for deciphering words you may not know. A prefix comes at the beginning of a word, a suffix at the end, and a root is the core part that carries the main meaning.

??x
A **prefix** adds to or changes the meaning of a root, while a **suffix** modifies or alters the form (e.g., making it into a noun or verb) without changing its basic meaning. For example:
- Prefix: **re-** in "rewrite" means again.
- Suffix: **-ed** in "walked" makes the word past tense.

Understanding these components can help you derive the meanings of unfamiliar words.
