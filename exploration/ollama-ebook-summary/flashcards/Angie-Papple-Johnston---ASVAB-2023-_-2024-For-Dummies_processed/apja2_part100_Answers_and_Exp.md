??x
A subscript next to an element’s symbol in a chemical formula indicates the number of atoms of that element in the molecule.

#### Earth's Layers: Crust
Background context explaining the crust. The crust is Earth’s surface and can be categorized into two types: continental and oceanic. Continental crust forms each of the continents, which are about 12 miles thick on average, while oceanic crust lies beneath the oceans and is approximately 5 miles thick.

??x
The continental crust.
x??

#### Earth's Layers: Mantle
Background context explaining the mantle. The mantle is the solid rock below the crust and accounts for about two-thirds of Earth’s mass. It can be further classified into three layers based on composition and seismic behavior.
:p What are the three main layers within the mantle?
??x
The mesosphere, asthenosphere, and lithosphere.
x??

---
#### Mesosphere in the Mantle
Background context explaining the mesosphere. The mesosphere is located in the lower mantle and surrounds Earth’s outer core. Despite high temperatures that could melt rock, a significant amount of pressure keeps materials solid here.
:p What is the primary characteristic of the mesosphere?
??x
The mesosphere has high enough temperatures to potentially melt rocks but remains solid due to immense pressure.
x??

---
#### Asthenosphere in the Mantle
Background context explaining the asthenosphere. The asthenosphere is in the middle part of the mantle, where rocks are mostly solid but behave like glaciers (plastic flow) under very high temperatures that can lead to some melting.
:p How do the rocks behave in the asthenosphere?
??x
The rocks in the asthenosphere are solid but move like glaciers due to plastic flow and high temperatures.
x??

---
#### Lithosphere
Background context explaining the lithosphere. The lithosphere is the uppermost part of Earth’s mantle, attached to the crust. It consists of solid, thick, brittle rocks that contain different minerals than those in the crust.
:p What are the key features of the lithosphere?
??x
The lithosphere is the upper part of the mantle and has solid, thick, brittle rocks with distinct mineral compositions compared to the crust.

#### Rock Classification: Sedimentary, Metamorphic, Igneous
Background context explaining rock classification. Geologists categorize rocks into three major types based on their formation processes: sedimentary (formed from the accumulation of sediments), metamorphic (transformed by heat and pressure), and igneous (formed from cooled magma or lava).
:p How are rocks classified in geology?
??x
Rocks are classified as sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous.
x??

---

#### Sedimentary Rocks
Background context explaining sedimentary rocks. These form from layers of sediment (particles, seashells) that harden over time. They are generally soft compared to other rock types but can contain fossils.
:p What is a characteristic feature of sedimentary rocks?
??x
A characteristic feature of sedimentary rocks is their formation through layers of sediment such as sand and seashells which harden over long periods, often containing fossils.
x??

---

#### Metamorphic Rocks
Background context explaining metamorphic rocks. These form due to heat and pressure below Earth's surface, sometimes showing shiny crystals like marble or gneiss.
:p What are some distinguishing features of metamorphic rocks?
??x
Distinguishing features of metamorphic rocks include the presence of shiny crystals and layered structures resembling ribbons, such as in marble or gneiss.
x??

---

#### Igneous Rocks
Background context explaining igneous rocks. These form from magma (molten rock) that cools into different types depending on how quickly it solidifies, like obsidian or granite.
:p What are the key differences between igneous and other rock types?
??x
The key difference is that igneous rocks form from molten material cooling underground, either rapidly forming shiny glasslike materials like obsidian, or slowly to form crystalline structures such as granite. This contrasts with sedimentary (formed by layers of sediment) and metamorphic (formed by heat and pressure).
x??

---

#### Earthquakes
Background context explaining earthquakes. These occur due to the breaking or sliding of tectonic plates along faults, releasing energy in seismic waves.
:p What causes an earthquake?
??x
An earthquake is typically caused by the breaking or sliding of tectonic plates along faults, which build up pressure over time until they suddenly release, creating seismic waves that shake the ground.
x??

---

#### Richter Magnitude Scale
Background context explaining the scale used to measure earthquakes. The scale uses a logarithmic formula where each whole-number increase represents a tenfold larger quake and 31 times more energy.
:p How does the Richter magnitude scale work?
??x
The Richter magnitude scale measures earthquake size using a logarithmic formula. Each whole-number increase on the scale means the earthquake is about ten times stronger and releases 31 times more energy than the previous number.
x??

#### Earthquake Zones
Background context explaining the zones where earthquakes commonly occur, such as the Pacific Rim, Alpide seismic belt, and mid-Atlantic ridge.
:p Where are earthquakes most likely to happen?
??x
Earthquakes are most likely to happen in specific zones including the Pacific Rim, the Alpide seismic belt (stretching from Java to Sumatra through the Himalayas and Mediterranean), and the mid-Atlantic ridge, which is underwater.

:p How many named oceans are there?
??x
There are five named oceans: the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, Arctic, and Southern. This division helps in tracking specific regions more easily while acknowledging Earth's single global ocean.
