#### Wheel Speed Comparison
Background context explaining that linear distance covered by a wheel is related to its circumference and revolutions per minute. The formula for linear speed: $\text{Linear Distance} = 2\pi r \times \text{rpm}$.
:p If Wheel A has a diameter of 9 feet and Wheel B has a diameter of 12 feet, if both wheels revolve at the same rate, which wheel will cover more distance per minute?
??x
Wheel B will cover more distance than Wheel A because it has a larger circumference. The linear distance covered is $\text{Circumference} = \pi d$, so Wheel B with a diameter of 12 feet covers more ground at the same rpm compared to Wheel A.

#### Shock Absorber Spring Constant
Background context explaining that spring constant $k $ can be calculated using Hooke's Law:$ F = kx$. Here, force is in pounds and distance is in inches.
:p If Jonas’s car hits a pothole with 600 pounds of force and the shock absorber compresses 3 inches, what is its spring constant in pounds per inch?
??x
The spring constant for Jonas's shock absorber is 200 pounds per inch. Using Hooke's Law $F = kx $, we get $600 \, \text{pounds} = k \times 3 \, \text{inches}$. Solving for $ k$gives $ k = \frac{600}{3} = 200$.

#### Lever System with Weights
Background context explaining that a lever system balances forces based on the principle of moments: $F_1d_1 = F_2d_2$. Here, the weight is placed closer to one end.
:p If a 600-pound weight is placed on a 10-pound board that has been evenly balanced between two scales and is 2/3 closer to the left than to the right, how much does the left scale measure?
??x
The left scale measures 405 pounds. The lever system balances such that $F_1d_1 = F_2d_2$. Given the weight is 2/3 of its total distance towards the left, we can set up the equation and solve for the force on the left side.

#### Inclined Plane Force Calculation
Background context: The formula used to determine how an inclined plane reduces effort is $\frac{\text{Length of Ramp}}{\text{Height of Ramp}} = \frac{\text{Weight of Object}}{\text{Force}}$.

:p If the ramp length is 4200 units and the height is 100 units, what is the force required to lift an object with a weight of 500 newtons?
??x
The formula $\frac{4200}{100} = \frac{500}{\text{Force}}$ simplifies to $42 = \frac{500}{\text{Force}}$. Solving for Force, we get:
$$\text{Force} = \frac{500}{42} \approx 12.14$$

Therefore, the force required is approximately 12.14 newtons.

??x
Using the formula for work:
$$\text{Work} = 50 \, \text{newtons} \times 1.2 \, \text{meters} = 60 \, \text{joules}$$

Thus, the work done is $60$ joules.

$$\text{MA} = \frac{\text{Output Force}}{\text{Input Force}}$$:p Determine the mechanical advantage of a block and tackle system if the output force is 7406 newtons and the input force is 3086 newtons.
??x
Using the formula for mechanical advantage:
$$\text{MA} = \frac{7406}{3086} \approx 2.4$$

Thus, the mechanical advantage of the block and tackle system is approximately $2.4$.

#### Wheel Speed Comparison
Background context: The circumference of a wheel determines its linear distance covered per revolution. The larger the diameter, the greater the linear distance.

:p Which wheel covers more distance in one full turn if both are turning at the same rate and Wheel B has twice the diameter of Wheel A?
??x
Since Wheel B has twice the diameter of Wheel A, it will cover double the distance in one full turn. Given that both wheels rotate at the same speed, Wheel A turns 25 percent more slowly than Wheel B.

#### Spring Force Calculation
Background context: The force on a spring is calculated using the formula $F = kx $, where $ F $ is force, $ k $ is the spring constant, and $ x$ is the displacement of the spring.

:p A spring with a 600 newtons spring constant is compressed by 3 inches. What is the force exerted?
??x
Using the formula for force on a spring:
$$F = 600 \times -3$$

Since the compression is negative, we get:
$$

F = -1800 \, \text{newtons}$$

Thus, the force exerted by the spring is $-1800$ newtons.

---
#### Scale Weight Distribution
Background context: In a balanced system, each scale supports half of its weight. If an object is closer to one side, that side will support more of the weight.

:p A 400-pound block is placed on two scales, and it's $\frac{2}{3}$ closer to the left than to the right. Each scale also supports 5 pounds from a board. How much total weight does the left scale support?
??x
The block is $\frac{2}{3}$ closer to the left side, so it supports:
$$\left(1 - \frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{1}{3}$$of its weight on the right scale. Thus, the left scale supports:
$$400 \times \frac{2}{3} + 5 = \frac{800}{3} + 5 = 266.67 + 5 = 271.67 \, \text{pounds}$$

The total weight supported by the left scale is approximately $405$ pounds.

#### Pedal Rate and Wheel Speed
Background context: The number of revolutions a wheel makes per minute can be calculated based on the pedal rate.

:p If the pedals are turning at 80 RPM, how many revolutions does the rear wheel make per minute if it turns 4 times for every full turn of the pedals?
??x
Given that the rear wheel turns 4812 times and each pedal turn results in 12 revolutions:
$$\text{Revolutions per minute} = 80 \times 4 = 320 \, \text{revolutions per minute}$$

Thus, the rear wheel rotates at $320$ RPM.

#### Gear Directional Relationship
Background context: Gears connected in series turn in opposite directions of each other.

:p How do gears 1 and 3 relate to gears 2 and 4 if they are connected in series, assuming the size of the gears is unknown?
??x
Gears 1 and 3 rotate clockwise, while gears 2 and 4 rotate counterclockwise. There isn't enough information to determine whether Choice (C) or Choice (D) is correct.
Thus, the correct answer is Choice (B).

#### Hydraulic Jack Pressure Analysis
Background context: A hydraulic jack uses an incompressible fluid where pressure must be equal everywhere. The relationship between force and area can be described by $P = \frac{F}{A}$.

:p If the output end of a hydraulic jack has five times the area where James is applying the force, what is the exerted force?
??x
Setting up the proportion for equal pressures:
$$P1 = P2 \Rightarrow \frac{F1}{A1} = \frac{F2}{A2}$$

Given $A2 = 5A1$:
$$F2 = 5F1$$

Thus, the exerted force is five times the applied force.
