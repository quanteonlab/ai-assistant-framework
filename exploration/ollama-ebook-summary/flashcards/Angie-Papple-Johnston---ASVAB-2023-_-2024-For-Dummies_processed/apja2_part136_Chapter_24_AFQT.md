#### Arithmetic Reasoning Basics
Background context: This section covers basic arithmetic reasoning, which involves applying mathematical operations to solve real-world problems. It includes topics such as simple calculations, percentages, ratios, and basic geometry.

:p What is Salvatore's total number of haircuts given per month in April, May, and June?
??x
Salvatore cuts 35 people per day for 7 days a week. Therefore, he cuts $35 \times 7 = 245$ haircuts per week. For three months (assuming an average of about 4 weeks per month), the total number of haircuts would be:
$$245 \times 4 \times 3 = 2940$$

However, this exact calculation isn't one of the options given. We should use the closest option provided: 
??2940 is not an option; using the closest value from the choices (B) 3150.
The correct answer is (B) 3150.

#### Pythagorean Theorem
Background context: This problem involves using the Pythagorean theorem to determine the height of a kite based on given distances.

:p If Tom is flying a kite at the end of a 500-foot string and his friend Kathy stands directly under the kite 300 feet away from Tom, how high is the kite?
??x
Using the Pythagorean theorem:$a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $, where $ c $(the hypotenuse) is 500 feet and$ b $(one leg of the triangle) is 300 feet. We need to find$ a$:
$$a^2 + 300^2 = 500^2$$
$$a^2 + 90000 = 250000$$
$$a^2 = 160000$$
$$a = \sqrt{160000} = 400$$

So, the height of the kite is (C) 400 feet.

#### Perimeter and Area
Background context: This question involves calculating the length of a rectangle using its perimeter and width.

:p If Amy wants to fence in a yard using 400 feet of fencing and she wants the yard to be 30 feet wide, what will its length be?
??x
The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is $2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})$. Given that the total perimeter is 400 feet and the width is 30 feet:
$$2 \times (l + 30) = 400$$

Divide both sides by 2 to get:
$$l + 30 = 200$$

Subtract 30 from both sides:
$$l = 170$$

So, the length will be (A) 170 feet.

??x
For the first digit, there are 2 choices (A or B).
For the second digit, there are 10 choices (0 through 9).
For the third digit, there are 26 choices (a through z).

The total number of combinations is:
$$2 \times 10 \times 26 = 520$$

So, the answer is (C) 520.

#### Speed and Distance
Background context: This problem involves using basic speed and distance formulas to find the time it takes for light from the sun to reach Earth.

:p The sun is 93 million miles from Earth, and light travels at a rate of 186,000 miles per second. How long does it take for light from the sun to reach Earth?
??x
The formula for time when distance and speed are known is:
$$\text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}}$$

Given that the distance $d $ is 93,000,000 miles and the speed$v$ is 186,000 miles per second:
$$\text{time} = \frac{93,000,000}{186,000} \approx 5$$

So, it takes approximately (A) 5 minutes for light from the sun to reach Earth.

#### Percentage Increase
Background context: This problem involves calculating a percentage increase based on current and previous values.

:p A tanning-bed pass for unlimited tanning costs $53 per month this year, but was only$50 per month last year. What is the percentage of increase?
??x
The formula to find the percentage increase is:
$$\text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New Value} - \text{Old Value}}{\text{Old Value}} \right) \times 100$$

Given that the new value is $53 and the old value is$50:
$$\text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{53 - 50}{50} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{3}{50} \right) \times 100 = 6\%$$

So, the answer is (C) 6 percent.

#### Word Problem with Division
Background context: This problem involves solving a simple division equation.

:p Eleven plus forty-one is divided by a number. If the result is thirteen, what’s the number?
??x
The equation to solve is:
$$\frac{11 + 41}{x} = 13$$

First, calculate $11 + 41$:
$$52 = 13 \times x$$

Divide both sides by 13:
$$x = \frac{52}{13} = 4$$

So, the answer is (D) 4.

#### Time Calculation
Background context: This problem involves converting hours to minutes.

:p Debra works an 8-hour shift on Friday. How many minutes does she work on Friday?
??x
Since there are 60 minutes in one hour:
$$\text{Total minutes} = 8 \times 60 = 480$$

So, the answer is (A) 480 minutes.

#### Ratios and Proportions
Background context: This problem involves understanding how ratios can be used to determine proportional relationships.

:p Six people can run three machines in the factory. How many machines can 18 people run?
??x
The ratio of people to machines is $6 : 3$. We need to find out how many machines 18 people can run:
$$\frac{6}{3} = \frac{18}{x}$$

Solve for $x$ by cross-multiplying:
$$6x = 54$$
$$x = \frac{54}{6} = 9$$

So, the answer is (B) 9.

#### Scale Drawing
Background context: This problem involves understanding how to scale measurements on a map.

:p On a map drawn to scale,$\frac{1}{2}$ inch equals 1 mile. What length on the map equals 5 miles?
??x
If $\frac{1}{2}$ inch represents 1 mile, then for 5 miles:
$$5 \times \left( \frac{\text{inch}}{1 \text{ mile}} \right) = 5 \times \left( \frac{1/2 \text{ inches}}{1 \text{ mile}} \right) = 2.5 \text{ inches}$$

So, the answer is (A) 2.5 inches.

#### Total Cost Calculation
Background context: This problem involves adding up multiple prices to find a total cost.

:p A man bought a pair of jeans for $23.00, a shirt for $14.95, and two ties for $7.98 each. What was the total cost of his clothing?
??x
Calculate the total cost step-by-step:
$$\text{Total} = 23.00 + 14.95 + (2 \times 7.98)$$
$$\text{Total} = 23.00 + 14.95 + 15.96 = 53.91$$

So, the answer is (A)$53.91.
