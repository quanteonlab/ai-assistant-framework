#### Avoiding Mirrors (Reflections)
Background context: In Assembling Objects problems, you may encounter shapes that are reflections of a given shape. It's important to distinguish between correctly rotated shapes and reflected ones.

:p How do you identify whether two shapes are not merely rotated but also mirrored?
??x
When comparing two shapes in an Assembling Objects problem, if one is the mirror image (flipped or reflected) of another, no amount of rotation will make them match. For example, a shape that can be turned upside down to look like its mirror image should be disregarded as a potential solution.

To illustrate this:
- A rotated shape might fit into the pattern by turning it in different directions.
- A mirrored shape would not align correctly if you try to rotate it, because flipping changes the orientation of features such as points and indentations differently than rotation does.

Example: Consider two shapes; one is a letter "A" rotated 180 degrees (flipped upside down), and another is a flipped "M." The "A" can be turned around different axes to match various orientations, but the "M" will always have its points in incorrect positions.

#### Crossing Over the Right Places
Background context: In Assembling Objects problems, if a line or any part of a shape intersects another element in a specific way in the first drawing, the correct solution must maintain this relationship.

:p How do you ensure that the intersection points between shapes are correctly positioned in your answer?
??x
To check if the intersection points are correct, look closely at how the lines intersect within the initial diagram. The same line-shape relationship should be present in the correct solution. For instance, a point inside a shape might cross a line only once or at multiple specific points.

Example: In Figure 17-4, Point B is located inside the star and intersects it at one of its indentations, not at a point. Therefore, any correct answer must have a similar intersection pattern.
x??

#### Putting All Together (Connecting Shapes)
Background context: When solving problems involving connecting shapes, ensure that all parts align correctly by matching points and lines from the original diagram.

:p What are some common mistakes to avoid when matching shapes in Assembling Objects problems?
??x
Common mistakes include:
- Incorrectly rotating a shape so it doesn't match the required connections.
- Misplacing connection points or using reflections of the original shape instead of rotations.

Example: In Figure 17-5, Choice (A) is incorrect because the line intersects the triangle at the wrong point and connects A incorrectly. Choice (B) might seem plausible but uses a mirror image of the given shape, which is not correct. Choice (D) presents an entirely different shape that doesn't align with the original.

To avoid these errors, carefully examine each option to ensure it matches both the points and lines from the first drawing.

#### Shapes (Jigsaw Puzzle Analogy)
Background context: Some Assembling Objects problems involve shapes that need to fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. The challenge is in visualizing how they should be assembled without physical manipulation.

:p How do you mentally assemble pieces of a jigsaw puzzle when solving Assembling Objects problems?
??x
To solve these problems, visualize the shapes fitting together as you would with a real jigsaw puzzle:
1. Mentally rotate and position each piece.
2. Check if the lines intersect correctly.
3. Confirm that all points align properly.

Example: In Figure 17-7, by sliding the shapes in the first drawing, it’s clear they form the picture shown in Choice (A).

To apply this method:
```java
public class PuzzleSolver {
    public void solvePuzzle() {
        // Assume shapes are stored as objects with positions and orientations.
        for (Shape shape : puzzlePieces) {
            // Rotate and relocate each piece to see if it fits correctly.
            if (fitsCorrectly(shape)) {
                System.out.println("Found the correct configuration.");
                return;
            }
        }
    }

    private boolean fitsCorrectly(Shape shape) {
        // Check intersections, points, etc., against the original diagram.
        // Return true if all conditions are met; false otherwise.
    }
}
```

#### Examining Spatial Relationships
Background context: Assembling Objects problems often require understanding spatial relationships between shapes. This includes recognizing patterns in how lines intersect and how points align.

:p How can you use spatial relationships to solve Assembling Objects problems?
??x
Use the following approach:
1. Identify key features like lines, indentations, and points.
2. Ensure these features maintain their correct relationship across all pieces.
3. Compare each option against the original diagram for accuracy.

Example: In Figure 17-9, look at how the curve of the leaf shape inside the square is not bowed out as in Choice (B) or too thin as in Choice (C). Only Choice (D) maintains the correct curve and thickness.
x??

#### Practice Mentally Rotating and Relocating Pieces
Background context: Some Assembling Objects problems involve simple jigsaw-like puzzles where shapes must be rotated and placed correctly.

:p How do you solve a simple jigsaw puzzle example given in Assembling Objects problems?
??x
To solve these, mentally slide the pieces together:
1. Identify which pieces can fit based on their edges.
2. Rotate each piece as necessary to align with others.
3. Ensure all connections match the original diagram.

Example: In Figure 17-8, Choice (A) is correct because it matches the pieces in the first drawing when mentally rotated and placed together.

To practice:
```java
public class SimpleJigsaw {
    public void assemblePuzzle() {
        // Assume shapes are stored as objects with positions and orientations.
        for (Shape piece1 : puzzlePieces) {
            for (Shape piece2 : puzzlePieces) {
                if (!piece1.equals(piece2)) { // Ensure two different pieces
                    if (fitsTogether(piece1, piece2)) {
                        System.out.println("Fitted: " + piece1 + " with " + piece2);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    private boolean fitsTogether(Shape piece1, Shape piece2) {
        // Check edges and orientation.
        return true; // Placeholder for actual logic
    }
}
```
