:p How does knowing the word "sang" (meaning "blood") in French help us understand the English word "sanguine"?
??x
Knowing that "sang" means "blood" in French can help us deduce that "sanguine" likely relates to blood, possibly meaning having a temperament associated with the color of blood.

:p How would you break down the word "detractor"?

#### Application on ASVAB Questions
For ASVAB questions, deconstructing a word by identifying its prefix, root, and suffix can make it easier to determine its meaning. For example, in "detractor," knowing that "de-" means away from, "tract" means pull, and "-or" is the suffix for one who does something.

:p How would you approach deconstructing the word "beneficent"?
??x
To approach deconstructing "beneficent":

#### Creating Your Own Context
Background context: The ASVAB Word Knowledge subtest includes questions where you might not know the exact meaning of a word. However, creating your own context can help you deduce the correct answer. You can think about phrases or sentences that include similar words to infer their meanings.

:p Have you heard the word "afoul" in any sentence before?
??x
If you've heard "running afoul of the law," you might remember that it doesn't mean correctly, easily, or disgusting. This leaves you with (B) wrongly as the correct answer.

#### Letting the Words Speak to You
Background context: Some words are inherently positive or negative, and their connotations can help eliminate incorrect answers in Word Knowledge questions. Pay attention to whether a word gives you a warm-fuzzy or cold-prickly feeling.

:p David hoped that going to the amusement park would help him shake his melancholy mood. What does "melancholy" most likely mean?
??x
Melancholy means being sad or down in the dumps. Since amusement parks are generally fun, and David wants to "shake" this feeling, it must be a negative emotion.

#### Practice and Application
Background context: The more you practice recognizing these signals and inferring meanings based on context, the better you'll perform on Word Knowledge questions.

:p How can you apply the strategy of using warm-fuzzy or cold-prickly feelings to solve a question?
??x
You can use this feeling to determine if a word is positive or negative. For example, in "Sadie applied at several colleges. However, only one accepted her," you might feel a cold-prickly sensation for the word "only," indicating it's a negative connotation.
