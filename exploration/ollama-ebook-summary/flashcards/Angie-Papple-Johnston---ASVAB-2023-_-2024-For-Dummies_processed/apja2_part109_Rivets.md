#### Hacksaw Usage
A hacksaw is a hand tool used to cut metal or other materials by the action of a blade that moves back and forth. The teeth on the blade are designed to cut against the grain, meaning you typically want to saw in the direction that the wood fibers are running.

:p What material should a hacksaw be used for cutting?
??x
A hacksaw is used to cut metal or similar hard materials. It can also be used with appropriate blades to cut other non-wooden materials like plastic or thin sheet metal.

Example:
```java
public class ToolUsage {
    public void useHacksaw() {
        // Logic to determine which blade type is needed based on the material
        if (materialIsMetal()) {
            insertBladeForMetal();
            sawAgainstTheGrain();
        } else {
            insertAppropriateBlade();
            sawProperly();
        }
    }

    private boolean materialIsMetal() {
        return true; // Assume for this example
    }

    private void insertBladeForMetal() {
        // Insert blade suitable for metal cutting
    }

    private void sawAgainstTheGrain() {
        // Saw in the direction opposite to the grain of the material
    }
}
```

#### Cold Chisel Driven Tool
A cold chisel is used for cutting, shaping, and separating materials like wood. To drive a chisel effectively without bending or breaking it, you need a heavy hammer that can deliver strong blows.

:p What tool would be best to use for driving a cold chisel?
??x
The best tool to use for driving a cold chisel is a sledgehammer (C). A sledgehammer provides the necessary force and impact needed to drive the chisel without damaging it. A hammer or mallet (A/C) may not provide enough power, while a plane (D) is used for smoothing surfaces.

Example:
```java
public class ChiselingToolSelection {
    public Tool selectToolForChiseling() {
        if (toolTypeRequired().equals("chisel")) {
            return new Sledgehammer(); // Select the appropriate tool
        }
        return null; // Return null if no suitable tool is found
    }

    private String toolTypeRequired() {
        return "chisel"; // Simulate tool type selection logic
    }
}
```

public class WoodworkingToolSelection {
    public Tool selectToolForCurves() {
        if (shapeComplexityHigh()) {
            return new CopingSaw(); // Select the appropriate tool
        }
        return null; // Return null if no suitable tool is found
    }

    private boolean shapeComplexityHigh() {
        return true; // Simulate complexity check logic
    }
}
```

#### Filling Holes with Plastic Filler
When filling in holes, especially in woodwork, it's common to use plastic filler. After applying and allowing the filler to dry, the next step is to sand the surface to ensure a smooth finish before painting or staining.

:p What should be done after filling a hole with plastic filler?
??x
After filling a hole with plastic filler and letting it dry, the next logical step is to sand the area (B). Sanding helps remove any excess filler and prepares the surface for primer or paint, ensuring a smooth and even finish.

Example:
```java
public class WoodfillingProcess {
    public void applyFillingAndSand() {
        // Apply plastic filler into holes
        fillHoleWithFiller();

        // Allow it to dry completely
        waitUntilDried();

        // Sand the filled area for a smooth surface
        sandFilledArea();
    }

    private void fillHoleWithFiller() {
        // Fill the hole with plastic filler
    }

    private void waitUntilDried() {
        // Wait until the filler is fully dry
    }

    private void sandFilledArea() {
        // Sand the filled area to ensure a smooth surface
    }
}
```
