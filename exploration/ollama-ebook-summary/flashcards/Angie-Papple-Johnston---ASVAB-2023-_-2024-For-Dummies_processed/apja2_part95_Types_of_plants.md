#### Plant Processes
Background context: Plants sustain themselves through processes such as photosynthesis, which involves capturing energy from sunlight, absorbing carbon dioxide, and releasing oxygen.

:p What are the two stages of photosynthesis?
??x
Photosynthesis occurs in two main stages:
- Light-dependent reactions: Chlorophyll absorbs sunlight, splits water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen (oxygen is released), and uses the hydrogen to produce glucose.
- The Calvin cycle: A series of chemical reactions that use the energy from light-dependent reactions to convert carbon dioxide into glucose.

These processes are crucial for plant survival and energy production.

#### Cell Structures in Living Things
Background context explaining cell structures. All cells share common characteristics: nucleus, cytoplasm, membrane, and ribosomes.

:p What are the four key components of all cells?
??x
All cells share four key components:
1. Nucleus - controls cellular activity.
2. Cytoplasm - a gel-like substance containing chemicals for life processes.
3. Cell membrane (plasma membrane) - holds the cell together and protects internal structures.
4. Ribosomes - manufacture proteins necessary for survival.

:p What are prokaryotes, and how do they differ from eukaryotes in terms of cellular structure?
??x
Prokaryotes are cells without a nucleus. In contrast to eukaryotic cells, their genetic material floats in the cytoplasm rather than being enclosed by a nuclear envelope.

#### Mitosis vs Meiosis
Mitosis is the process by which a cell divides to produce identical daughter cells, each containing the same number of chromosomes. In contrast, meiosis produces sex cells (eggs and sperm) with half the number of chromosomes.

:p What are the two main types of cell division in genetics?
??x
The two main types of cell division in genetics are mitosis and meiosis.
- Mitosis results in daughter cells that have identical sets of 46 chromosomes.
- Meiosis results in four haploid (23 chromosomes) gametes.
