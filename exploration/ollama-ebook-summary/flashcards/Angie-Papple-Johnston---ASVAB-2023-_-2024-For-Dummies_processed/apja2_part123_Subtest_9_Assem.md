#### Train Travel Distance Calculation
Background context: This problem involves calculating distances traveled by two trains over a period of time. The total distance is found by adding the individual distances each train has covered, which can be calculated using the formula $\text{Distance} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}$.

:p How do you calculate the total distance between two moving objects traveling towards or away from each other?
??x
To find the total distance, add the distances traveled by both trains. Each train's distance can be calculated using the formula $\text{Distance} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}$.

For Train 1: $55 + \frac{3}{16} \times 3$ hours
For Train 2:$70 + \frac{21}{10} \times 3$ hours

Adding these distances gives the total distance between them.
??x
```plaintext
Train 1 Distance = (55 + 3/16) * 3 = 165.1875 miles
Train 2 Distance = (70 + 21/10) * 3 = 210.6 miles

Total distance = 165.1875 + 210.6 = 375.7875 miles, which can be rounded to 375 miles.
```

#### Board Length Calculation
Background context: This problem involves converting units of measurement and then calculating the total length required for molding based on given dimensions.

:p How do you determine the shortest board length necessary if the sections need to be a specific length?
??x
First, convert feet to inches:$3 \text{ feet} = 36 \text{ inches}$.

Each section is 44 inches long, and four sections are needed. The total amount of molding required is:

$44 \times 4 = 176$ inches.

Convert the total length from inches to feet by dividing by 12:$\frac{176}{12} \approx 14.67$ feet, so the shortest board length necessary is 15 feet.
??x
```plaintext
Total inches needed = 44 * 4 = 176 inches

Convert to feet: 176 / 12 ≈ 14.67 feet, which rounds up to 15 feet.

#### Cost Calculation for Turkey Breasts
Background context: This problem involves calculating the total cost of turkey breasts after applying a discount.

:p How do you calculate the total cost if one item is at full price and another has a discount?
??x
First, calculate the discounted price of the first turkey breast:

Original Price =$8.50

Discounted Price = $8.50 - (8.50 \times 10\%) = 8.50 - 0.85 = 7.65$

Add the full price of the second turkey breast:

Total Cost = $7.65 + 8.50 = 16.15$ dollars.
??x
```plaintext
Discounted Price: 8.50 - (8.50 * 0.1) = 7.65

Full price of second turkey breast: 8.50

Total Cost: 7.65 + 8.50 = 16.15 dollars.
```

#### Work Week Calculation
Background context: This problem involves finding a fraction of a workweek in hours.

:p How do you calculate the number of hours a recruiter travels weekly if given a workweek and a fractional travel schedule?
??x
First, find $\frac{2}{5}$ of the 40-hour workweek:$\text{Hours traveled weekly} = \frac{2}{5} \times 40 = 16$ hours.
??x
```plaintext
Total hours worked in a week: 40

Fraction of travel time: (2/5) * 40 = 16 hours.
```
