#### Profit Calculation on Donuts
Background context: The problem involves calculating profit from selling donuts and understanding cost, revenue, and profit relationships.

:p A baker sells a dozen donuts for $3.99. The cost to make three donuts is$0.45. How much is the total profit on 5 dozen donuts?
??x
To find the total profit, first calculate the selling price per donut and then determine the cost per donut.

1. Selling price per dozen = $3.99.
2. Cost for three donuts = $0.45, so cost per donut =$0.45 / 3 =$0.15.
3. Cost for a dozen (12) donuts = 12 * $0.15 =$1.80.
4. Revenue from selling one dozen = $3.99, and the cost is$1.80.
5. Profit per dozen = $3.99 -$1.80 =$2.19.
6. Total profit for 5 dozen donuts = 5 * $2.19 =$10.95.

Therefore, the total profit on 5 dozen donuts is **$10.95**.

#### Coin Calculation
Background context: The problem involves determining the number of dimes in a piggy bank containing both dimes and quarters with a given total value and quantity.

:p Your piggy bank contains $19.75 in dimes and quarters. There are 100 coins in all. How many dimes are there?
??x
Let $d $ be the number of dimes, and$q$ be the number of quarters.

From the problem:
1. Total value:$0.10d + 0.25q = 19.75$.
2. Total coins: $d + q = 100$.

We can solve these equations by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution:

- From the second equation, we get $q = 100 - d$.
- Substitute into the first equation:
  $$0.10d + 0.25(100 - d) = 19.75.$$

Simplify and solve for $d$:
$$0.10d + 25 - 0.25d = 19.75,$$
$$-0.15d = -5.25,$$
$$d = \frac{5.25}{0.15} = 35.$$

Therefore, there are **35 dimes**.

#### Area of a Patio
Background context: The problem involves calculating the cost to lay a patio given the dimensions and rate per square foot.

:p A bricklayer charges$8 per square foot to lay a patio. How much would it cost for the bricklayer to lay a 12-foot-by-16-foot patio?
??x
To find the total cost, calculate the area of the patio first:

- Area = Length * Width = 12 feet * 16 feet.
- Total cost = Area * Rate = (12 * 16) * $8.

Let's compute:
$$ \text{Area} = 192 \text{ square feet},$$
$$ \text{Total cost} = 192 * 8 = \$1,536. $$

Therefore, the total cost is **$1,536**.

#### Wages of Three Workers
Background context: The problem involves setting up and solving a system of linear equations to find each worker's hourly wage.

:p Terry earns three times more per hour than Tim. Tim earns $2 more per hour than Angie. As a group, they earn$43 per hour. What’s Angie’s hourly wage?
??x
Let $A $ be Angie's hourly wage,$T $ be Tim's hourly wage, and$Tr$ be Terry's hourly wage.

From the problem:
1.$T = A + 2$,
2. $Tr = 3T = 3(A + 2)$,
3. Total earnings: $A + T + Tr = 43$.

Substitute $T $ and$Tr$ into the total earnings equation:
$$ A + (A + 2) + 3(A + 2) = 43,$$
$$ A + A + 2 + 3A + 6 = 43,$$
$$ 5A + 8 = 43,$$
$$ 5A = 35,$$
$$

A = 7.$$

Therefore, Angie’s hourly wage is **$7**.

#### Machine Operations
Background context: The problem involves determining the number of machines that can be run by a certain number of people based on a given ratio.

:p If four people can run eight machines, how many machines can two people run?
??x
Let $M$ be the number of machines two people can run. We know:

- Four people : Eight machines = Two people :$M$ machines.
- $\frac{4}{8} = \frac{2}{M}$.

Cross-multiply to solve for $M$:

$$ 4M = 16,$$
$$

M = 4.$$

Therefore, two people can run **4 machines**.

#### Season Pass Cost Comparison
Background context: The problem involves comparing the cost of a season pass with daily admissions over multiple trips.

:p The price of daily admission at an amusement park is $36. The park sells an unlimited season pass for$240. How many trips would you need to make with the season pass in order for it to cost less than paying the daily admission rate?
??x
Let $n$ be the number of trips needed.

The total cost of daily admissions after $n$ trips is:
$$36n \geq 240.$$

Solve for $n$:

$$ n \geq \frac{240}{36},$$
$$n \geq 6.67.$$

Since the number of trips must be an integer, you need to make at least **7 trips**.

Therefore, you would need **7 trips** for the season pass to cost less than daily admissions.

#### Carpeting a Room
Background context: The problem involves calculating the area that can be covered by a given amount of food based on calorie content and finding how much of another food item has the same number of calories.

:p A half-cup of pudding has 150 calories. The same amount of broccoli has 60 calories. How much broccoli can a person eat to equal the same number of calories in the $\frac{1}{2}$ cup of pudding?
??x
Let $b$ be the amount of broccoli needed.

The calorie content per cup of broccoli is:
$$60 \text{ calories} / 0.5 \text{ cups} = 120 \text{ calories per cup}.$$

To find how much broccoli equals 150 calories:
$$ b \times 120 = 150,$$
$$ b = \frac{150}{120},$$
$$b = 1.25.$$

Therefore, a person can eat **1.25 cups** of broccoli to equal the same number of calories in $\frac{1}{2}$ cup of pudding.

#### Nighttime Barking
Background context: The problem involves calculating how many times a dog barks at intervals within a given time period.

:p The neighbor’s dog barks at a raccoon every 15 minutes at night. If it first barks at 10 p.m., when you’re trying to fall asleep, how many times will it have barked by 2 a.m., when you give up trying to sleep and decide to read a book instead?
??x
First, calculate the total time in hours from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m.:
$$\text{Total time} = (2 - 10) + 12 = 4 \text{ hours}.$$

Convert this into minutes:
$$4 \times 60 = 240 \text{ minutes}.$$

Since the dog barks every 15 minutes, calculate the number of times it will bark:
$$\frac{240}{15} = 16.$$

Therefore, the dog will have barked **16 times** by 2 a.m.
