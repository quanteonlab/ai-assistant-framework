Example Calculation:
- If your scaled scores are as follows: AR = 28, MK = 30, PC = 25, WK = 29.
- Sum of scaled scores = 28 + 30 + 25 + 29 = 112
- Convert the sum to a percentile (AFQT score) through military scoring tables.

The AFQT score is crucial for determining your eligibility and which jobs you can qualify for in the military.
