#### Exponents and Roots
Exponents are used to represent repeated multiplication. For example, $x^8 $ means$x \times x \times x \times x \times x \times x \times x \times x$. Roots are the inverse operation of exponents; for instance, the fourth root of 16 is a number that, when raised to the power of 4, equals 16.
:p What is the value of $y $ in the equation$y = x^2 - 42 $ if$x = 8$?
??x
The value of $y$ is calculated as follows:
$$y = 8^2 - 42 = 64 - 42 = 22.$$

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 20.
