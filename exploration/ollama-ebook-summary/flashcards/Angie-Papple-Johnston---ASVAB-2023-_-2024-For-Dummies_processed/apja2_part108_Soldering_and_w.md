#### Bench Planes
Bench planes are finishing tools used to smooth wooden surfaces. They consist of parts such as the blade or iron, chip breaker, lever cap, and frog. Longer planes provide more uniform surfaces by shaving off portions of wood. A planer is a larger machine that creates flat surfaces using several blades on a roller.
:p What are the components of a bench plane?
??x
A bench plane comprises several key parts: a blade or iron, chip breaker, lever cap, and frog (used to hold the blade). These tools are used for smoothing wooden surfaces. Longer planes achieve more uniform results by removing wood in layers, while planers use multiple blades on a roller to create flat surfaces.

#### Clamping Tools
Clamping tools are essential for holding or fastening objects securely during work. They come in various types, each suited to specific tasks.

Pliers can be used to hold objects temporarily while working on them.
Vises are specialized clamps designed for particular materials and operations:
- **Bench Vise**: Large, rough jaws keep the material from slipping.
- **Pipe Vise**: Specifically for round materials or pipes.
- **Hand Screw Vise**: Two hard wooden jaws connected by long screws that tighten to hold objects.

Clamps offer an alternative when a vise is not suitable. Types of clamps include:
- **C-clamp**: Comprised of a cast-iron "C" frame and a screw mechanism for opening and closing.
- **Bar Clamp**: Used for larger pieces, typically several feet wide.

#### Fasteners

Fasteners are crucial for holding materials together with strength and stability. Common fasteners include nails, screws, bolts, and rivets.

Nails are used to join pieces of wood:
- **Flat head** and usually round shank.
- The length is denoted by the penny system (10d = 10-penny nail).
- The higher the penny size, the longer the nail. Nails larger than 20-penny are called spikes.

:p What is a common method for designating nail lengths?
??x
The penny system.

x??

---
#### Fasteners: Nail Length Designation

Nail length is designated by the penny system. A 10d nail corresponds to a ten-penny nail.
