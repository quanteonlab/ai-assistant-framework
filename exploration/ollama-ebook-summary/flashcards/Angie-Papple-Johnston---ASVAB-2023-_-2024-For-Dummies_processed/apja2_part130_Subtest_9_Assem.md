#### Simple Fixed Pulley
A simple fixed pulley does not change the force required to lift a load but changes the direction of the applied force. The mechanical advantage (MA) of a simple fixed pulley is always 1 because it only changes the direction, not the magnitude of the force.
:p What is the mechanical advantage of a simple fixed pulley?
??x
The mechanical advantage of a simple fixed pulley is 1 because it does not change the magnitude of the force applied but only changes its direction.

#### Lever Principle
When moving baskets A and B, if Basket A moves to the right, it will counterbalance the loss in cherries from Basket B by gaining an equal number of cherries.
:p How does moving Basket A affect Basket B?
??x
Moving Basket A to the right will gain cherries, which is balanced by a corresponding loss of cherries in Basket B. This balance ensures that the total number of cherries remains constant.
x??

---
#### Rotational Speed and Distance Covered
Wheel B must make more revolutions than Wheel A to cover the same distance because it has a smaller diameter and thus covers less ground per revolution.
:p Which wheel covers the distance more slowly?
??x
Wheel B covers the distance more slowly because it has a smaller diameter, requiring more revolutions to cover the same distance as Wheel A.
x??

---
#### Calculating Pressure (psi)
Pressure can be calculated using the formula: $$\text{Pressure} = \frac{\text{Force}}{\text{Area}}$$

Given that the force is 200 and the area is 10, we get:
$$

P = \frac{200}{10} = 20 \, \text{psi}$$:p Calculate the pressure given a force of 200 pounds and an area of 10 square inches.
??x
The pressure is calculated as follows:
$$

P = \frac{200}{10} = 20 \, \text{psi}$$

This shows that for every square inch of surface area, there is a force of 20 pounds exerted per inch.
x??

---
#### Lever Principle Application
When Anvil A is moved toward the center, Anvil B will move toward the ground because they are in balance. The movement of one affects the other due to their leverage system.
:p What happens when Anvil A is moved closer to the center?
??x
When Anvil A is moved closer to the center, it carries more weight, causing Anvil B to move toward the ground to maintain balance. This demonstrates how the lever principle works in equilibrium systems.
x??

---
#### Inclined Plane Mechanical Advantage
The mechanical advantage of an inclined plane can be calculated using the formula:
$$\text{MA} = \frac{\text{Length of Ramp}}{\text{Height of Ramp}}$$

Given a length of 6 feet and a height of 3, we calculate:
$$

MA = \frac{6}{3} = 2$$:p Calculate the mechanical advantage of an inclined plane with a ramp length of 6 feet and a height of 3 feet.
??x
The mechanical advantage is calculated as follows:
$$

MA = \frac{6}{3} = 2$$

This means that for every foot of vertical lift, you can apply half the force required to lift the object directly upward.
x??

---
#### Micrometers and Measurement Range
Micrometers are used to measure very small objects but not microscopic ones. They provide high precision in measuring dimensions down to fractions of a millimeter.
:p What can micrometers accurately measure?
??x
Micrometers can accurately measure very small but not microscopic objects, providing precise measurements down to fractions of a millimeter.
x??

---
#### Lever Principle with Weights
Reducing the weight on Side B will cause Side A to move toward the ground because the lever principle dictates that more force is needed on the side with less mass.
:p What happens when the weight on Side B is reduced?
??x
When the weight on Side B is reduced, Side A will move toward the ground due to the imbalance caused by the lever principle. This ensures that both sides maintain equilibrium.
x??

---
#### Friction and Surface Interaction
Friction occurs when two surfaces are rubbed together, creating resistance. It can be reduced or increased depending on the materials involved.
:p What is friction?
??x
Friction is the force that resists relative motion between two surfaces in contact. This interaction can increase or decrease based on the nature of the materials and their surface conditions.
x??

---
#### Atmospheric Pressure
The normal atmospheric pressure at sea level is 14.7 pounds per square inch (psi).
:p What is the normal atmospheric pressure?
??x
Normal atmospheric pressure, also known as standard atmospheric pressure, is 14.7 psi at sea level.
x??

---
#### Gear Meshing
Gears of unequal size can mesh properly if their teeth are of equal size, ensuring that they rotate in opposite directions and maintain proper contact.
:p Can gears of different sizes mesh correctly?
??x
Yes, gears of different sizes can mesh correctly as long as their teeth interlock properly. This is ensured by having the same tooth pitch on both gears.
x??

---
#### Torque Application
Torsion springs apply torque when they coil or uncoil, producing a twisting action rather than a direct pull.
:p What does a torsion spring do?
??x
A torsion spring applies torque by coiling and uncoiling, creating a rotational force. This is different from a direct pull, as it primarily generates a twisting motion.
x??

---
#### Inclined Plane Efficiency
An inclined plane is the most efficient device for moving heavy objects a few feet in height because it requires less effort compared to lifting directly.
:p Which device is most efficient for lifting heavy objects a short distance?
??x
The inclined plane is the most efficient device for moving heavy objects a few feet in height. It reduces the force required by allowing the object to be moved gradually, thereby making the task easier.
x??

---
#### Cam and Valve Mechanism
A cam with three high points will open the valve three times per revolution as each high point hits the valve.
:p How many times does the valve open per revolution?
??x
The valve opens three times per revolution because there are three high points on the cam, each of which hits the valve once per rotation.
x??

---
#### Valve Control in a System
Closing Valves 3 and 4 will keep water from leaving the tank by isolating these pathways to prevent water flow.
:p How do you control the water flow using valves?
??x
By closing only Valves 3 and 4, you isolate certain paths in the system, preventing water from flowing out of the tank. This effectively controls the water flow by blocking specific channels.
x??

---
#### Gear Directionality
Gears meshed together always turn in opposite directions to maintain proper contact and function correctly.
:p How do gears behave when they are meshed?
??x
When gears are meshed, they always rotate in opposite directions to ensure that their teeth interlock properly and maintain smooth operation. This opposite direction is crucial for the gear mechanism to work effectively.
x??

---

#### Gearing Ratios
Background context explaining the relationship between gear sizes and rotation speeds. The formula for calculating the speed of a second gear given the first is:$\text{Speed of Gear 2} = \frac{\text{Speed of Gear 1}}{\text{Ratio of Sizes}}$.

:p If Gear 1 turns at 10 rpm, then Gear 2, which is half the size, turns twice as fast. What would be the speed of Gear 2?
??x
The speed of Gear 2 would be 20 rpm because $\frac{\text{Speed of Gear 1}}{\text{Ratio of Sizes}} = \frac{10\ \text{rpm}}{0.5} = 20\ \text{rpm}$.
x??

---

#### Valve Opening and Fuel Flow
Explanation on the function of valves in controlling fuel flow through filters and reservoirs.

:p Which set of valve openings allows the fuel to travel through Filter D?
