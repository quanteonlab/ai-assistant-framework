#### Signal Phrase and Context
Background context explaining how to identify and use signal phrases like "as if" or "like."
:p What is a signal phrase, and how does it help in answering Word Knowledge questions?
??x
A signal phrase like "as if" or "like" indicates that the word you need to define is likely to be similar to another word. In such cases, look for words with similar meanings among the answer choices.

#### Ruling Out Wrong Answers
Explanation of how to eliminate unlikely answers by comparing them and considering prefixes/suffixes.
:p How can you use "ruling out wrong answers" as a strategy in Word Knowledge questions?
??x
You should examine each answer choice carefully. If two choices mean almost the same thing, or if some choices don't match the prefix, suffix, or root word, you can eliminate them. This narrows down your options and increases your chances of finding the correct answer.

#### Inhabit vs. Vacate
Explanation on using context clues to differentiate between similar words.
:p What is a good strategy for differentiating between words with similar meanings?
??x
Using context clues, such as synonyms or antonyms, can help. For example, "inhabit" means to live in or occupy, while "vacate" means to leave or give up occupation of. Since the sentence doesn't suggest leaving but rather staying, "reside" (Choice B) is the best fit.
x??

#### Deform vs. Cure
Explanation on using prefixes and roots to deduce meaning.
:p How can you use a prefix to determine the correct answer in Word Knowledge questions?
??x
The prefix "de-" often means "away from." The root word form of "deform" suggests "shape," so "contort" (Choice C) fits well as it involves distorting or twisting. "Cure" and "heal" are synonymous, so they can be eliminated.
x??

---

#### Replacing Word Choices
Explanation on using substitution to find the correct answer.
:p How can you use substitution to solve a Word Knowledge question?
??x
Substitute each word from the choices into the sentence to see which one fits best. For example, in "The CDC hasn’t been able to identify the pathogen that these people ingested before turning into zombies," only "bacteria" makes logical sense.
x??

---

#### Parts of Speech
Explanation on how understanding parts of speech can help eliminate incorrect answers.
:p How does knowledge of parts of speech assist in answering Word Knowledge questions?
??x
Knowing the part of speech of the underlined word and the answer choices can help eliminate options. For example, if "viable" is an adjective describing Cameron’s option, you can rule out verbs like "succeed." The correct choice is (C) reasonable.
x??

---

#### Analogous Meaning
Explanation on how to determine the correct meaning based on suffixes.
:p How can the suffix of a word help identify its meaning and narrow down answer choices?
??x
The suffix "-ous" usually modifies nouns and turns words into adjectives, like "analogous," which means comparable. This helps eliminate options that are not adjectives (B) danger and (C) write. The correct answer is (D) comparable.
x??

---

#### Viable Meaning
Explanation on how to determine the part of speech and use it in context.
:p How can you identify the correct part of speech for a word and use it to find the right answer?
??x
Identify that "viable" is an adjective describing Cameron's option. The verb (A) succeed, adjective (B) glowing, adjective (C) reasonable, and noun (D) life can be ruled out by their parts of speech. Replacing viable with each choice shows (C) reasonable fits best.
x??

#### Deconstructing Words
Explanation on breaking down words to understand meanings.
:p How can prefix breakdown help in understanding the meaning of a word?
??x
The prefix "de-" often means "away from," and when combined with root words like "form" or "plume," it suggests actions related to removing or altering. For example, "desensitize" involves reducing sensitivity, "decode" involves deciphering, and "deplume" involves removing feathers.
x??

#### Approachability
Approachability refers to how easily someone can be approached or communicated with. The suffix -able indicates "capable of," suggesting that a person is capable of being accessible and approachable.

:p What does the term "approachable" imply about a person's demeanor?

#### CAT-ASVAB vs. Paper-and-Pencil ASVAB
The computer-adaptive test (CAT-ASVAB) at MEPS allows no backtracking once a question is submitted. On the other hand, the paper-and-pencil version offers more flexibility with review and change options.

:p What are the key differences between the CAT-ASVAB and the paper-and-pencil ASVAB?
??x
The key differences include:
1. **CAT-ASVAB**:
   - No backtracking once a question is submitted.
   - You can only submit answers; no review or changes are allowed.

2. **Paper-and-Pencil ASVAB**:
   - Allows review and changes within the same section.
   - Flexibility in pacing, as you can move at your own speed.

These differences affect how you should approach answering questions to optimize performance.

#### Vocabulary Building
Having a broad vocabulary is beneficial for doing well on the Word Knowledge subtest. Strategies like short-term memorization and test-taking skills can help even if your vocabulary isn't extensive.

:p Why is having an extensive vocabulary important for the ASVAB?
??x
An extensive vocabulary is crucial because it helps in understanding and answering questions more effectively, especially those involving synonyms, antonyms, and analogies. A larger vocabulary allows you to interpret words accurately and quickly, which can be a significant advantage on the test.

#### Effective Test-Taking Strategies
Strategies such as eliminating obviously incorrect answers before guessing can improve your chances of getting questions right.

:p How can you increase your chances of answering ASVAB questions correctly if you need to guess?
??x
To increase your chances, eliminate any clearly wrong answer choices first. This increases the likelihood of selecting the correct answer by reducing the number of options and improving the odds from 25% (random guessing) to a higher percentage.

For example, if there are four possible answers, eliminating one incorrect option gives you a 33% chance of being right.

#### Importance of Reading for Vocabulary Building
Background context explaining the importance of reading to expand vocabulary. Studies show that those who read for enjoyment have a much larger vocabulary than non-readers.
:p Why is reading essential for building your vocabulary?
??x
Reading exposes you to words and their usage in print, which is crucial for understanding and retaining new terms. This differs from merely hearing or seeing them in daily conversation because it involves processing the word in context.
x??

#### Starting with Daily Newspapers
Explanation on how starting with simple reading materials like newspapers can help build vocabulary gradually.
:p How can you start building your vocabulary without overwhelming yourself?
??x
Begin with materials that are just slightly more challenging than what you typically read. For instance, start with daily newspapers or news magazines. These contain a mix of common and less common words used in context.

#### Using Context to Understand Words
Explanation on how context clues can help understand unfamiliar words without direct translation.
:p How can understanding the context around an unknown word help?
??x
Context clues provide hints about the meaning of a word by using surrounding text. For instance, if you read "The scientist extrapolated from the data," and you're unsure what "extrapolated" means, consider possible synonyms like "used" or "applied." This can help deduce the correct meaning.

Creating a personal list allows you to document unfamiliar words, their meanings, and example sentences. This active engagement helps reinforce the word’s usage and meaning. For instance:
```
The scientist extrapolated from the data.
Definition: used the data to make some sort of decision, judgment, or guess.
Example sentence: The researcher extrapolated future trends based on past data.
```
