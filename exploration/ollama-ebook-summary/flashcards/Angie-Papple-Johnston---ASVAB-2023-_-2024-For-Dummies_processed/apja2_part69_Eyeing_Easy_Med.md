**Starting Chapter:** Eyeing Easy Medium and Hard Questions. Understanding the big four Your AFQT scores

---

#### Questioning ASVAB Difficulty
Understand that questions on the ASVAB range from easy to hard, with a mix of difficulty levels. On paper-and-pencil tests, they are presented randomly. CAT-ASVAB adapts based on your performance, offering harder or easier questions accordingly.
:p How does the ASVAB adapt its question difficulty?
??x
The ASVAB adapts its difficulty level based on your responses. If you answer an easy question correctly, the next one is likely to be of medium difficulty. Correct answers to medium questions may prompt even harder ones. This adaptive process aims to assess your knowledge efficiently.

#### Deciphering Raw Scores
Raw scores are the total points for each subtest without considering the difficulty level of the questions. They aren't used directly but form the basis for standard scores and other derived measures.
:p What is a raw score in the context of ASVAB?
??x
A raw score on the ASVAB represents the number of correct answers you provide across different sections of the test. It doesn’t account for the difficulty level of the questions.
x??

---

#### Understanding Standard Scores
Standard scores are calculated by converting raw scores based on a standard distribution with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. These scores indicate performance relative to others, not absolute correctness.
:p How are standard scores determined?
??x
Standard scores are derived from your raw score by applying a conversion formula that aligns the scores on a normal distribution curve with a mean (average) of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. This means that most people will have scores between 30 and 70.
x??

---

#### ASVAB Score Card Example
ASVAB score cards provide multiple types of scores, including raw and standard scores. High school guidance counselors use one type while military enlistment uses another.
:p What does an ASVAB score card typically contain?
??x
An ASVAB score card contains various scores such as raw scores, which are not directly visible but used to calculate other scores, and standard scores that indicate your performance relative to others. High school counselors use a specific version designed for students, while the military uses another version for enlistment purposes.
x??

---

#### ASVAB Score Distribution
The majority of ASVAB test takers receive average or above-average standard scores, with most falling between 30 and 70 on this distribution.
:p What is the typical score range for ASVAB test takers?
??x
Typically, most ASVAB test takers receive scores in the middle to upper-middle range of the standard distribution. This means that a majority will have scores around or above average, with the mean set at 50 and a normal distribution curve applied.
x??

---

#### Percentile Scores
Background context explaining how percentile scores work. These scores range from 1 to 99, indicating your performance relative to a norm group. For example, if you score at the 72nd percentile, it means that you performed as well as or better than 72 out of every 100 individuals in the norm group.

:p What does a percentile score of 72 mean?
??x
A percentile score of 72 means that you scored as well as or better than 72 out of every 100 people in the comparison group.
x??

---

#### Composite Scores (Line Scores)
Background context explaining composite scores, which are unique to each military service branch and used for job qualification determination. Each branch has its own system for compiling various standard scores into individual composite scores.

:p What is a composite score?
??x
A composite score is an individually computed score specific to each military service branch, derived from combining different subtest scores. These scores are used by the branches to determine eligibility for certain jobs.
x??

---

#### AFQT Scores
Background context on how the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) score is crucial for enlistment. The AFQT score is based on four subtests: Word Knowledge, Paragraph Comprehension, Arithmetic Reasoning, and Mathematics Knowledge.

:p What are the subtests used to compute the AFQT score?
??x
The AFQT score is computed using four specific subtests: Word Knowledge (WK), Paragraph Comprehension (PC), Arithmetic Reasoning (AR), and Mathematics Knowledge (MK).
x??

---

#### ASVAB Subtest Focus Based on Career Goals
Background context on tailoring study time based on career goals. Not all subtests are equally important for every job, so focus should be placed on those relevant to your desired field.

:p How should you allocate your study time?
??x
You should allocate your study time based on the relevance of each subtest to your career goals. Spend more time on areas that will impact your chosen job and less on areas where you have no interest or requirement.
x??

#### Calculating AFQT Score Process
Background context on how the military calculates the AFQT score, involving a specific process with four subtests contributing.

:p How is the AFQT score determined?
??x
The AFQT score is calculated by assessing your performance on four key subtests: Word Knowledge (WK), Paragraph Comprehension (PC), Arithmetic Reasoning (AR), and Mathematics Knowledge (MK). The military uses these scores to determine eligibility for enlistment.
x??

---

#### Verbal Expression (VE) Score Calculation
To understand how to calculate the VE score, it’s important to know that this score is derived from your Word Knowledge and Paragraph Comprehension scores. First, you add these two subtest scores together, then convert the sum into a scaled score ranging from 20 to 62.
:p How do you calculate the Verbal Expression (VE) score?
??x
To calculate the VE score, first add the Word Knowledge and Paragraph Comprehension scores. The result is then converted to a scaled score between 20 and 62. This final score represents your verbal expression ability.
x??

---

#### Raw AFQT Score Calculation
The raw AFQT score is calculated by doubling the VE score and adding the Arithmetic Reasoning (AR) and Mathematics Knowledge (MK) scores to it. The formula for this calculation is: 
Raw AFQT Score = 2VE + AR + MK
:p How do you calculate the raw AFQT score?
??x
The raw AFQT score is calculated by first doubling your Verbal Expression (VE) score, then adding the Arithmetic Reasoning (AR) and Mathematics Knowledge (MK) scores to this doubled value. The formula is: Raw AFQT Score = 2VE + AR + MK.
x??

---

#### AFQT Score Categories
The AFQT scores are categorized into five main groups based on percentile ranks as shown in Table 1-3. These categories determine the trainability of recruits for various military jobs and enlistment eligibility.
:p How are AFQT scores categorized?
??x
AFQT scores are categorized into five main groups based on their percentile rank, with Category V being the lowest and not trainable, while Category I is the highest, outstanding in trainability. Each category has specific percentile ranges as described in Table 1-3.
x??

---

#### Enlistment Requirements for Special Programs
Achieving a minimum AFQT score opens doors to enlistment but higher scores improve your chances of approval for special programs such as those requiring medical or criminal history waivers.
:p How do AFQT scores affect enlistment into special programs?
??x
Higher AFQT scores increase the likelihood of being approved for special enlistment programs, especially those that require waivers for medical or criminal histories. Recruits with higher scores are seen as more trainable and potentially more valuable to the military.
