$$8 - 2y + 2 = 6 + 2$$

Simplifying, we get:
$$10 - 2y = 8$$

Subtract 10 from both sides:
$$-2y = 8 - 10$$

Thus,$$-2y = -2$$

Finally, divide by -2 to solve for $y$:
$$y = \frac{-2}{-2} = 1$$

Therefore,$y = 1$.

#### Adding Fractions
Background context: To add fractions, you need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of all denominators is used as the common denominator.
:p How do you add the fractions $\frac{18}{32}$,$\frac{28}{40}$, and $\frac{14}{16}$?
??x
To add these fractions, find the least common multiple (LCM) of 32, 40, and 16. The LCM is 160.

Convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 160:
$$\frac{18}{32} = \frac{18 \times 5}{32 \times 5} = \frac{90}{160}$$
$$\frac{28}{40} = \frac{28 \times 4}{40 \times 4} = \frac{112}{160}$$
$$\frac{14}{16} = \frac{14 \times 10}{16 \times 10} = \frac{140}{160}$$

Now add the fractions:
$$\frac{90}{160} + \frac{112}{160} + \frac{140}{160} = \frac{342}{160} = \frac{171}{80}$$

The sum is $\frac{171}{80}$.

```java
public class FractionAddition {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num1 = 90, den1 = 160;
        int num2 = 112, den2 = 160;
        int num3 = 140, den3 = 160;

        int numeratorSum = num1 + num2 + num3; // 342
        int denominator = 160; // LCM

        System.out.println("The sum is " + numeratorSum + "/" + denominator);
    }
}
```

#### Triangle Angle Sum Theorem
Background context: The sum of the interior angles of any triangle always adds up to 180 degrees. This can be used to find unknown angles in a triangle.
:p In a triangle, if two angles measure 34° and 108°, what is the value of the third angle?
??x
The value of the third angle can be found by subtracting the sum of the other two angles from 180 degrees:
$$180 - (34 + 108) = 180 - 142 = 38°$$

Explanation: The sum of the interior angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. By subtracting the known angle measures from this total, we can find the measure of the third angle.

#### Percentages
Background context: To convert a decimal to a percentage, you multiply the decimal by 100. In this case, you need to solve for $x$ in the equation where 40% of 9 equals some value.
:p If 40% of 9 is equal to $\frac{x}{100}$, what is the value of $ x$?
??x
To find the value of $x$, start with the equation:
$$0.40 \times 9 = \frac{x}{100}$$

Multiply both sides by 100 to isolate $x$:
$$x = 0.40 \times 9 \times 100$$
$$x = 360$$

Convert the decimal 0.45 to a percent:
$$0.45 \times 100 = 45\%$$

Explanation: To find $x $, first calculate$0.40 \times 9$ and then multiply by 100 to convert it into a percentage.

```java
public class PercentageCalculation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double decimal = 0.40;
        int value = 9;

        // Calculate the product of the decimal and the value, then multiply by 100
        double x = decimal * value * 100;
        System.out.println("The value of x is " + (int) x);
    }
}
```

#### Pythagorean Theorem
Background context: In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse ($c $) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides ($ a $and$ b$). This theorem can be used to find an unknown side length.
:p A right triangle has one leg measuring 24 units and a hypotenuse of 25 units. What is the length of the other leg?
??x
To find the length of the other leg, use the Pythagorean Theorem: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

Given:
- One leg ($a$) is 24.
- Hypotenuse ($c$) is 25.

Plugging in the values:
$$24^2 + b^2 = 25^2$$
$$576 + b^2 = 625$$

Solving for $b^2$:
$$b^2 = 625 - 576$$
$$b^2 = 49$$

Taking the positive square root of both sides:
$$b = \sqrt{49} = 7$$

The length of the other leg is 7 units.

Explanation: The Pythagorean theorem helps us find an unknown side in a right triangle. Here, we solved for $b$ by rearranging and simplifying the equation.
```java
public class PythagoreanTheorem {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 24;
        int c = 25;

        // Calculate b using the Pythagorean theorem: b^2 = c^2 - a^2
        double b_squared = Math.pow(c, 2) - Math.pow(a, 2);
        double b = Math.sqrt(b_squared);

        System.out.println("The length of the other leg is " + (int) b);
    }
}
```

#### Decreasing by a Value
Background context: To decrease something means to subtract from it. Here, you're taking 11 away from $x$. The phrase “is” translates to an equals sign in equations.
:p If "twice x" is decreased by 11 and the result is equal to some value, what equation represents this situation?
??x
The equation that represents this situation is:
$$2x - 11 = \text{some value}$$

Explanation: The phrase “twice x” means $2x $. Decreasing it by 11 gives us the expression $2x - 11$, which equals some value. To find that value, you need to solve for the equation.

For example, if we know the result is 7:
$$2x - 11 = 7$$

Add 11 to both sides to isolate $2x$:
$$2x = 18$$

Divide by 2:
$$x = 9$$```java
public class DecreasingValue {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double result = 7; // Given result

        // Solving the equation 2x - 11 = 7
        double x = (result + 11) / 2;
        System.out.println("The value of x is " + x);
    }
}
```

#### Volume of a Right Cylinder
Background context: The volume $V $ of a right cylinder can be calculated using the formula$V = \pi r^2 h $, where $ r $is the radius and$ h$ is the height.
:p A figure consists of a rectangle on the left with dimensions 7.5 cm by 10 cm, and a right triangle on the right whose base is 3.5 cm and whose height is 8 cm. What is the total area?
??x
The total area can be found by adding the areas of the rectangle and the right triangle.

For the rectangle:
$$A = l \times w = 10 \text{ cm} \times 7.5 \text{ cm} = 75 \text{ cm}^2$$

For the right triangle:
$$

A = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times 3.5 \text{ cm} \times 8 \text{ cm} = 14 \text{ cm}^2$$

Adding these areas together gives the total area:
$$75 \text{ cm}^2 + 14 \text{ cm}^2 = 89 \text{ cm}^2$$

Explanation: The area of a rectangle is given by $A = l \times w $ and the area of a right triangle is given by$A = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h$. By summing these areas, you get the total area.

```java
public class CylinderArea {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double lengthRectangle = 10;
        double widthRectangle = 7.5;

        double baseTriangle = 3.5;
        double heightTriangle = 8;

        // Calculate areas
        double areaRectangle = lengthRectangle * widthRectangle;
        double areaTriangle = (baseTriangle * heightTriangle) / 2;

        // Total area
        double totalArea = areaRectangle + areaTriangle;
        System.out.println("The total area is " + totalArea + " cm^2");
    }
}
```

#### Ratio of Girls to Boys
Background context: The problem provides the number of boys and asks for the ratio of girls to boys. You need to find how many girls there are first, then calculate the ratio.
:p If there are 38 girls and 17 boys, what is the ratio of girls to boys?
??x
The ratio of girls to boys can be found by dividing the number of girls by the number of boys.

Given:
- Number of girls = 38
- Number of boys = 17

The ratio of girls to boys is:
$$\frac{38}{17} = 2:1$$

Explanation: The ratio simplifies to $2:1$ because 38 divided by 17 equals 2.

#### Maximizing AFQT Score
Background context: The Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) is a composite score derived from four sections of the ASVAB. To maximize your AFQT score, you need to excel in areas such as Arithmetic Reasoning and Mathematics Knowledge.

:p How can one maximize their AFQT score?
??x
To maximize your AFQT score, focus on excelling in key areas:
- **Arithmetic Reasoning**: Practice solving word problems involving basic arithmetic operations.
- **Mathematics Knowledge**: Strengthen your knowledge of algebraic equations, geometry, and other math concepts.

Here is a simple example of how to practice Arithmetic Reasoning:

```pseudocode
function solve_arithmetic_problem(question) {
    // Parse the question for numbers and operators
    let equation = parse_question(question);
    
    // Solve the arithmetic problem
    let result = evaluate(equation);
    
    return result;
}
```

And here is an example of how to practice Mathematics Knowledge:

```pseudocode
function solve_math_problem(equation) {
    // Parse and simplify the equation
    let simplified_equation = simplify(equation);
    
    // Solve for the variable
    let solution = solve(simplified_equation);
    
    return solution;
}
```

These examples demonstrate how to approach problem-solving in a structured manner.

#### Improving English Skills
Background context: Enhancing your English skills is crucial, as they are tested through questions on Paragraph Comprehension and Word Knowledge. You can improve by reading extensively, writing regularly, and working on vocabulary.

:p How can one improve their English skills for the ASVAB?
??x
Improving your English skills involves several strategies:
- **Reading Extensively**: Engage with a variety of texts to understand different styles and contexts.
- **Writing Regularly**: Practice writing essays or summaries to enhance your comprehension and expression.
- **Building Vocabulary**: Learn new words daily, use them in sentences, and try to incorporate them into conversations.

For example, you can create flashcards for vocabulary:

```pseudocode
class Flashcard {
    String word;
    String definition;

    Flashcard(String w, String d) {
        this.word = w;
        this.definition = d;
    }

    void display() {
        System.out.println(word + ": " + definition);
    }
}

public class VocabularyFlashcards {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Flashcard card1 = new Flashcard("Ambiguous", "Lacking clarity or precision");
        card1.display();
    }
}
```

This code helps you keep track of new words and their meanings.
