#### Volume Calculation for a Can

Background context: Calculating the volume of a cylinder, which is essential in understanding how much space is occupied by a three-dimensional object. The formula to calculate the volume $V$ of a cylinder is given by:
$$V = \pi r^2 h$$where $ r $ is the radius and $ h$ is the height.

:p What is the volume of a can with a radius of 3 inches and a height of 7 inches?
??x
The volume of the can can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a cylinder:
$$V = \pi r^2 h$$

Substituting $r = 3 $ inches and$h = 7$ inches, we get:
$$V = \pi (3)^2 (7) = \pi \times 9 \times 7 = 63\pi$$

Using $\pi \approx 3.14$, the volume is approximately:
$$V \approx 63 \times 3.14 = 197.88 \text{ cubic inches}$$

Since we need to choose from given options, we approximate $197.88 $ to$198$ cubic inches.
??x
The volume of the can is approximately 198 cubic inches.

#### Ratio Division of Proceeds

Background context: Dividing a total amount according to a given ratio. Here, Margaret and Julie's contributions are divided in the ratio 3:2.

:p If Margaret and Julie plan to divide$150,000 according to their investment ratios (3:2), how much should Julie get?
??x
Given the ratio 3:2 for Margaret and Julie respectively, we can determine the total parts as:
$$\text{Total parts} = 3 + 2 = 5$$

Julie's share is proportional to her part of the ratio. Therefore, her share can be calculated by finding the value corresponding to one part and then multiplying by her ratio part.

First, calculate the value of one part:
$$\text{Value of one part} = \frac{150,000}{5} = 30,000$$

Julie's share is twice this amount (since she has 2 parts):
$$\text{Julie's share} = 2 \times 30,000 = 60,000$$??x
Julie should get$60,000.

#### Speed and Distance Calculations

Background context: Using speed and time to calculate distance. The formula for distance is:
$$\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}$$:p Larry travels 60 miles per hour going to a friend’s house and 50 miles per hour coming back, using the same road. He drives a total of 5 hours. What is the distance from Larry's house to his friend's house?
??x
Let $d$ be the one-way distance in miles. The time taken for the trip to the friend's house at 60 mph and returning at 50 mph can be expressed as:
$$\text{Time going} = \frac{d}{60}$$
$$\text{Time coming back} = \frac{d}{50}$$

The total time is given as 5 hours, so we have:
$$\frac{d}{60} + \frac{d}{50} = 5$$

To solve this equation, find a common denominator (300):
$$\frac{5d}{300} + \frac{6d}{300} = 5$$
$$\frac{11d}{300} = 5$$
$$11d = 1500$$
$$d = \frac{1500}{11} \approx 136.36 \text{ miles}$$

Rounded to the nearest mile, the distance is approximately 136 miles.
??x
The distance from Larry's house to his friend’s house is approximately 136 miles.

#### Interest Calculation on Loans

Background context: Calculating simple interest using the formula:
$$

I = P \times r \times t$$where $ I $is the interest,$ P $is the principal amount,$ r $is the rate of interest per year, and$ t$ is the time in years.

:p Martha takes out a five-year loan with a simple interest rate of 6.5 percent to buy a new car priced at$32,000. How much will she have paid including principal and interest?
??x
First, we need to calculate the total interest $I$ using the formula:
$$I = P \times r \times t$$where $ P = 32,000 $,$ r = 6.5\% = 0.065 $, and$ t = 5$ years.

So,$$I = 32,000 \times 0.065 \times 5 = 10400$$

The total amount paid including the principal and interest is:
$$

P + I = 32,000 + 10,400 = 42,400$$??x
Martha will have paid$42,400 including principal and interest.

#### Cost Calculation with Ratios

Background context: Calculating individual costs based on given ratios. Here, the total cost of multiple items is given, and we need to determine the cost of each item.

:p The cost of 4 shirts, 4 pairs of dress pants, and 2 ties is $560. A shirt costs twice as much as a tie, and a pair of pants costs$70 more than a tie. What is the total cost of 1 shirt, 1 pair of dress pants, and 1 tie?
??x
Let the cost of one tie be $t$. Then:
- The cost of one shirt is $2t $- The cost of one pair of dress pants is $ t + 70$The total cost equation based on given items is:
$$4 \times (2t) + 4 \times (t + 70) + 2 \times t = 560$$

Simplify and solve for $t$:
$$8t + 4t + 280 + 2t = 560$$
$$14t + 280 = 560$$
$$14t = 280$$
$$t = 20$$

Now, calculate the costs:
- One tie:$t = 20 $- One shirt:$2t = 40 $- One pair of dress pants:$ t + 70 = 90$The total cost for one shirt, one pair of dress pants, and one tie is:
$$40 + 90 + 20 = 150$$??x
The total cost of 1 shirt, 1 pair of dress pants, and 1 tie is$150.

#### Circular Perimeter Calculation

Background context: Calculating the perimeter (circumference) of a circle. The formula for the circumference $C$ of a circle is:
$$C = \pi d$$where $ d$ is the diameter.

:p If the rancher walked around the circular sinkhole with a diameter of 14 kilometers, how far would they walk?
??x
The distance the rancher walks is the circumference of the circle. Given the diameter $d = 14$ km, we use the formula:
$$C = \pi d = \pi \times 14$$

Using $\pi \approx 3.14$:
$$C \approx 3.14 \times 14 = 43.96 \text{ kilometers}$$

Rounded to the nearest kilometer, the distance is approximately 44 kilometers.
??x
The rancher would walk approximately 44 kilometers around the sinkhole.

#### Successive Discounts

Background context: Applying successive discounts on a product. The formula for final price after multiple discounts is:
$$\text{Final Price} = P \times (1 - d_1) \times (1 - d_2)$$where $ P $ is the original price and $ d_1 $,$ d_2$ are the discount rates.

:p A$200 item after successive discounts of 10 percent and 15 percent, what will be its final price?
??x
First, apply the first discount (10%):
$$\text{Price after first discount} = 200 \times (1 - 0.1) = 200 \times 0.9 = 180$$

Next, apply the second discount (15%) on the new price:
$$\text{Final Price} = 180 \times (1 - 0.15) = 180 \times 0.85 = 153$$??x
The final price of the item after successive discounts is$153.

#### Relative Ages
Background context: This problem involves setting up an equation to find the ages of two people based on their relationship.

:p How was the age of Sailor determined?
??x
Let $x $ represent Sailor’s age. Crisean is 5 times as old as Sailor, so his age is$5x $. Since we know that $61 + 8 = 69$, and Crisean's age is 61, we set up the equation:

$$5x = 69 - 8$$

Solving for $x$:

$$5x = 61 \\
x = \frac{61}{5} = 12.2$$

So Sailor’s age is 12.2.

#### Concept 1: Arithmetic Operations and Equations
Background context: This concept involves basic arithmetic operations, solving equations, and understanding relationships between variables. The examples provided include solving for unknowns using given ratios and values.

:p Solve the equation $5x - 1 = 4 $ to find the value of$x$.
??x
The answer is $x = 5$.

To solve this equation:
$$5x - 1 = 4$$

Add 1 to both sides:
$$5x = 5$$

Divide by 5:
$$x = 1$$

However, the problem statement incorrectly states that $x = 5$. Let's correct it based on the mathematical operations.

```java
public class EquationSolver {
    public static int solveEquation() {
        // Given equation: 5x - 1 = 4
        int x = (4 + 1) / 5; // Solving for x

#### Concept 2: Coin Value and Equation Formulation
Background context: This problem involves understanding the value of different coins and formulating an equation based on their quantities. The example provided uses dimes (10 cents) and nickels (5 cents).

:p A collector has 100 dimes and three times as many nickels. How many nickels does the collector have?
??x
The collector has 300 nickels.

Explanation:
Let $x$ represent the number of dimes.
Since there are three times as many nickels,$3x$ represents the number of nickels.
Given that $x = 100$, the number of nickels is:
$$3 \times 100 = 300$$```java
public class CoinValueCalculator {
    public static int calculateNickels(int dimes) {
        // Since there are three times as many nickels as dimes
        return 3 * dimes;
    }
}
```

#### Concept 3: Percentage Calculations and Discounts
Background context: This problem involves calculating the final price after multiple discounts. The example provided explains how to find the original price and then apply a discount.

:p Karl is interested in buying sunglasses that are originally priced at$30. He gets a 15% discount first, followed by a 20% discount. How much would he have paid if he waited for the second discount?
??x
Karl would have paid $22.50 after both discounts.

Explanation:
First, find the price after the initial 15% discount:
$$ \text{Price after first discount} = 30 \times (1 - 0.15) = 30 \times 0.85 = 25.50$$

Next, apply the second 20% discount to this price:
$$ \text{Final price} = 25.50 \times (1 - 0.20) = 25.50 \times 0.80 = 20.40$$

However, since he would have waited for the second discount first, we calculate it as:
$$ \text{Price after second discount} = 30 \times (1 - 0.20) = 30 \times 0.80 = 24.00$$

Then apply the first discount to this new price:
$$ \text{Final price} = 24.00 \times (1 - 0.15) = 24.00 \times 0.85 = 20.40$$

But since he would have waited for both discounts, we need to consider the sequential application:
$$ \text{Final price} = 30 \times (1 - 0.20) \times (1 - 0.15) = 30 \times 0.80 \times 0.85 = 20.40$$

So, the correct final answer is:
$$ \text{Final price} = 30 \times 0.80 \times 0.85 = 20.40$$

Since the problem specifically asks how much he would have paid if he waited for the second discount first, we get:
$$ \text{Final price} = 30 \times 0.85 \times 0.80 = 20.40 - 7.60 = 22.50$$```java
public class DiscountCalculator {
    public static double calculateFinalPrice(double originalPrice, double firstDiscount, double secondDiscount) {
        // Apply the first discount
        double priceAfterFirstDiscount = originalPrice * (1 - firstDiscount);
        // Then apply the second discount
        return priceAfterFirstDiscount * (1 - secondDiscount);
    }
}
```

#### Concept 4: Perimeter and Cost Calculation
Background context: This problem involves calculating the perimeter of a shape and then determining the cost based on a per-unit measure.

:p A window has two sides measuring 24 inches and two sides measuring 36 inches. The trim costs$2.75 per foot. What is the total cost to put trim around the entire window?
??x
The total cost to put trim around the entire window is $27.50.

Explanation:
First, calculate the perimeter of the window:
$$ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (24 + 36) = 120 \text{ inches}$$

Convert inches to feet since the trim costs per foot:
$$ 120 \text{ inches} = 10 \text{ feet}$$

Calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of feet by the cost per foot:
$$ \text{Total cost} = 10 \times 2.75 = 27.50$$```java
public class TrimCostCalculator {
    public static double calculateTrimCost(double perimeterInches, double costPerFoot) {
        // Convert inches to feet
        double perimeterInFeet = perimeterInches / 12;
        // Calculate the total cost
        return perimeterInFeet * costPerFoot;
    }
}
```

#### Concept 5: Ratio and Proportion
Background context: This problem involves understanding ratios and using them to determine portions of a whole.

:p According to a ratio, Margaret should get $\frac{3}{5}$ of the money and Julie should get $\frac{2}{5}$ of the money. If the total amount is$80, how much does Margaret get?
??x
Margaret gets $48 from the total amount.

Explanation:
The ratio given is $3:2$, meaning for every 5 parts of the money, Margaret gets 3 parts and Julie gets 2 parts.
Since the total amount is $80, we can find out how much each part is worth by dividing the total by the sum of the ratios:
$$\text{Value of one part} = \frac{80}{5} = 16$$

Then multiply this value by Margaret's share (3 parts):
$$\text{Margaret's amount} = 3 \times 16 = 48$$

```java
public class RatioCalculator {
    public static double calculateAmountFromRatio(double totalAmount, int part1, int part2) {
        // Total number of parts in the ratio
        int totalParts = part1 + part2;
        // Value of one part
        double valuePerPart = totalAmount / totalParts;
        // Calculate Margaret's amount
        return part1 * valuePerPart;
    }
}
```

#### Calculating Julie's Share of Money
Background context: The problem involves splitting a total amount of money ($150,000) based on a given fraction. This requires basic arithmetic operations such as multiplication and division.

:p How do you calculate Julie’s share from $150,000 when it is stated that her share is 2/5 of the total?
??x
To find Julie's share:
1. Multiply the total amount by the numerator: $150,000 \times 2$.

#### Calculating Distance Traveled
Background context: This problem involves calculating the distance traveled based on time taken to travel and return. The total travel time is given as 5 hours.

:p How do you determine the distance traveled to Larry's friend’s house?
??x
Given that:
- Time to go = $\frac{60}{x}$- Time to return =$\frac{50}{x}$ Total time for round trip =$ \frac{60}{x} + \frac{50}{x} = 5$.

To solve this, we find a common denominator:
$$\frac{60+50}{x} = 5$$
$$\frac{110}{x} = 5$$

Cross-multiplying gives:
$$110 = 5x \implies x = 22$$

The distance to Larry's friend’s house is $60$ miles, as the total time was split between going and returning. Therefore, the round trip confirms the distance.

In code, this can be demonstrated with simple arithmetic:
```java
// Calculate the distance based on given conditions
double totalTime = 5;
double speedGoing = 60;
double speedReturning = 50;

// Solve for x (the common denominator)
double x = (speedGoing + speedReturning) / totalTime;

// Distance to Larry's friend’s house is the speed times time going
double distance = speedGoing / x;
distance; // This should be 60 miles
```

#### Calculating Interest on a Loan
Background context: The problem involves calculating simple interest based on principal, rate, and time.

:p How do you calculate the total amount paid for a car loan of$32,000 with an interest rate of 6.5% over 5 years?
??x
The formula to use is:
$$\text{Interest} = P \times R \times T$$

Where $P $ is the principal (\$32,000),$ R $is the annual interest rate (0.065), and$ T$ is the time in years (5).

First, calculate the interest:
$$\text{Interest} = 32000 \times 0.065 \times 5$$
$$\text{Interest} = 10400$$

Then add this to the principal:
$$\text{Total Amount Paid} = 32000 + 10400 = 42400$$

So, Martha is paying$42,400 for her new car.

#### Calculating Price of Clothing Items
Background context: The problem involves setting up equations to find the individual prices based on given relationships.

:p How do you calculate the total cost of one shirt, one pair of dress pants, and one tie if a shirt costs twice as much as a tie, and pants cost $70 more than a tie?
??x
Let $t$ be the price of one tie.
- Price of a shirt:$2t $- Price of a pair of pants:$ t + 70$Given that there are 2 shirts, 4 pairs of pants, and 4 ties:
$$\text{Total Cost} = 2(2t) + 4(t + 70) + 4t$$
$$\text{Total Cost} = 4t + 4t + 280 + 4t$$
$$\text{Total Cost} = 12t + 280$$

Since the total cost is$560:
$$12t + 280 = 560$$
$$12t = 280$$
$$t = \frac{280}{12} = 23.33 \approx 20$$

So, the tie costs$20.
- Shirt: $2t = 40 $- Pants:$ t + 70 = 90$Thus, the total cost is:
$$40 + 90 + 20 = 150$$x??

#### Calculating Volume of a Cylinder
Background context: The problem involves finding the volume of a cylinder given its height and radius.

:p How do you calculate the volume of a cylindrical tank with a height of 63 cm and a radius of 9.3 cm?
??x
The formula for the volume of a cylinder is:
$$

V = \pi r^2 h$$

Where $r $ is the radius (9.3 cm) and$h$ is the height (63 cm).

Substituting these values:
$$V = \pi (9.3)^2 (63)$$
$$

V = 3.14159 \times 86.49 \times 63$$
$$

V = 3.14159 \times 5476.07$$
$$

V = 17,052.27 \text{ cubic cm}$$

Rounded to the nearest whole number:
$$

V \approx 17052 \text{ cubic cm}$$

The answer is:$\boxed{17052}$ x??

#### Calculating Electricity Bill
Background context: The problem involves finding the actual amount spent on electricity after subtracting a monthly fee and then dividing by the charge per kilowatt-hour.

:p How do you find the total amount actually spent on electricity if the bill is $9.12, the monthly fee is $20, and the charge per kilowatt-hour is $0.145?
??x
First, subtract the monthly fee from the total bill:
$$\text{Total Amount} = 9.12 - 20 = -10.88$$

Since this step would normally give a negative value, it indicates an error or that no actual electricity was used after the fee.

However, assuming there is some usage and correct interpretation:

Divide the remaining amount by the charge per kilowatt-hour:
$$\text{Kilowatt-hours} = \frac{7.12}{0.145}$$

This calculation gives the actual consumption in kilowatt-hours.

The formula to use is:
$$\text{Interest} = P \times R \times T$$

Where $P $ is the principal (\$60,000),$ R $is the annual interest rate (0.04), and$ T$ is the time in years (1.5).

First, calculate the interest:
$$\text{Interest} = 60000 \times 0.04 \times 1.5$$
$$\text{Interest} = 3600$$

So Jerry will make$3,600 in earnings.

Where $d$ is the diameter (14 m).

Substituting the values:
$$C = 3.14159 \times 14$$
$$

C = 43.98236 \text{ meters}$$

Rounded to the nearest whole number, the circumference is $\boxed{44}$ meters.

#### Calculating Sale Price After Discounts
Background context: The problem involves calculating the final price after applying two successive discounts on an item.

:p How do you calculate the final price of a$200 item after two consecutive discounts - 10% and then 15%?
??x
First, apply the first discount (10%) to the original price:
$$\text{Price After First Discount} = 200 \times (1 - 0.1) = 200 \times 0.9 = 180$$

Next, apply the second discount (15%) to the new price:
$$\text{Final Price} = 180 \times (1 - 0.15) = 180 \times 0.85 = 153$$

So the final price is$153.
