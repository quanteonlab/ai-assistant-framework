#### Determining What the Question is Asking
Background context: The second step is to identify exactly what the question is asking. Sometimes, the question is directly stated; at other times, it may require identifying key information from the problem.

:p How do you determine what the question is asking in a word problem?
??x
To determine what the question is asking in a word problem, carefully read the entire problem and look for specific keywords that indicate the type of calculation needed. For example:
- Addition: sum, total, in all, perimeter, increased by, combined, added.
- Division: share, distribute, ratio, quotient, average, per, out of, percent.
- Equals: is, was, are, were, amounts to.
- Multiplication: product, total, area, cubic, times, multiplied by, of.
- Subtraction: difference, how much more, exceed, less than, fewer than, decreased.

In the example provided:
```
How many cubic inches of sand can a cardboard box measuring 12 inches long by 14 inches wide by 10 inches tall contain?
```
The question asks for the volume, which is determined using the formula $V = l \times w \times h$.

```java
// Example code to calculate the volume
public class VolumeCalculator {
    public static int calculateVolume(int length, int width, int height) {
        return length * width * height;
    }
}
```

#### Digging for Relevant Facts
Background context: After determining what the question is asking, identify which data is necessary to solve the problem and which is extraneous. List all facts and variables from the problem on your scratch paper, attach units of measurement, and eliminate irrelevant information.

:p How do you determine which facts are relevant in solving a word problem?
??x
To determine which facts are relevant in solving a word problem, list all given data and variables on your scratch paper along with their units. Then, cross out any information that is not needed to solve the specific question at hand. For example:

In this problem:
```
To raise money for the school yearbook project, Tom sold 15 candy bars, Becky sold 12 candy bars, Debbie sold 17 candy bars, and Jane sold the most at 50.
How many candy bars did Becky, Debbie, and Jane sell?
```

List of facts:
- Tom: 15 bars
- Becky: 12 bars
- Debbie: 17 bars
- Jane: 50 bars

The question asks for the total number of bars sold by Becky, Debbie, and Jane. Therefore, Tom's sales are irrelevant and can be crossed out.

Relevant facts:
- Becky: 12 bars
- Debbie: 17 bars
- Jane: 50 bars

Total = 12 + 17 + 50 = 79 bars.

#### Setting Up and Solving Arithmetic Problems
Background context explaining how to approach arithmetic problems by setting up a formula, identifying knowns and unknowns, and solving for the unknown. The example provided involves Joan saving money over a certain period to achieve her goal.

:p How can you set up an equation to solve for an unknown value in an arithmetic problem?
??x
To set up an equation, first identify what needs to be solved (unknown). In this case, we need to find out how much Joan should save each year. The formula is based on the total savings goal and the number of years she has to save.

The equation can be represented as: ym $,15000 where y = 3 years and$15,000 is the total amount needed.
To find m (the annual savings), you rearrange the formula:
$$y \times m = 15000$$

Given that $y = 3$:
$$3m = 15000$$

Solving for m by dividing both sides by 3:
$$m = \frac{15000}{3} = 5000$$

Therefore, Joan needs to save$5,000 each year.

#### Visualizing Problems with Diagrams
Background context explaining how diagrams can help in understanding and solving problems. The example given involves calculating the area of a room by drawing it out.

:p How can a diagram aid in solving a problem involving the area of a room?
??x
A diagram helps you visualize the dimensions and layout, making it easier to calculate areas or other geometric properties accurately. For instance, if the room has different wall lengths (15 feet, 14 feet, 8 feet, and 6 feet), drawing these measurements on paper can help in calculating the total area.

If we draw a diagram of the room, we can see that it's not a perfect rectangle but rather an irregular shape. However, by breaking it down into simpler shapes (like rectangles or triangles) and using the given dimensions, we can calculate the area more easily.

#### Isolating Unknowns in Equations
Background context explaining how to isolate unknown variables in equations to solve for them. The example involves solving an equation with known values.

:p How do you isolate an unknown variable in an arithmetic equation?
??x
To isolate an unknown variable, follow these steps:
1. Identify the equation and the known values.
2. Rearrange the equation so that the unknown is on one side of the equals sign.
3. Perform operations (like division or multiplication) to isolate the unknown.

For example, if you have the equation $3m = 15000 $, where $ m$ is the amount Joan needs to save each year:
- Start with: $3m = 15000 $- Divide both sides by 3 to isolate$ m$:
$$m = \frac{15000}{3}$$- Simplify to find $ m$:
$$m = 5000$$

Therefore, Joan needs to save$5,000 each year.

#### Handling Distractions in Problems
Background context explaining how to identify and ignore irrelevant information that may distract from solving the problem. The example involves Joan's dream years being a distraction.

:p How do you handle distractions in arithmetic problems?
??x
In problems like this, it’s crucial to focus on relevant information. Distractions can be numbers or details that don’t contribute to the solution. For example, in Joan's case, her 12-year-long dream is irrelevant; what matters is the number of years she has left to save ($15,000 over 3 years).

To solve:
- Identify relevant data: total amount needed ($15,000), time frame (3 years).
- Use this information to set up an equation and solve for the unknown.

For example:
$$ym = 15000$$

Given $y = 3$:
$$3m = 15000$$

Solving for $m$ by dividing both sides by 3:
$$m = \frac{15000}{3} = 5000$$

Therefore, Joan needs to save$5,000 each year.

#### Verify Solution Probability
Background context: It's crucial to ensure that your solution makes sense and is reasonable. Use common sense to verify if the answer seems probable, especially for problems involving real-world measurements.

:p Does your solution seem probable?
??x
Use common sense to evaluate whether a 12-by-16-foot roof being covered in only 12 shingles is likely.

#### Correct Answer and Units of Measurement
Background context: Ensure that the answer you've arrived at correctly addresses the question asked, especially concerning units of measurement. For instance, if the problem asks for cubic feet, ensure your solution is expressed in those units.

:p Does it answer the question asked?
??x
If a question asks how many trees are remaining after 10 percent were cut down, check whether you've calculated the 90 percent that remains rather than 10 percent.
x??

#### Double-Check Your Answer
Background context: Test-makers often provide answers close to the correct one. It's essential to review your solution multiple times to ensure accuracy.

:p Are you sure?
??x
Double-check your calculations, especially when dealing with real-world problems where slight differences can lead to significantly different results.
x??

#### Consistency in Units of Measurement
Background context: Ensure that your answer uses the same units as those provided in the problem. For example, if a question asks for cubic feet but you calculate in cubic yards, convert the final answer.

:p Is your answer expressed using the same units?
??x
If asked to find how many cubic feet of concrete are required and you calculated in cubic yards, ensure you convert the result to cubic feet.
x??

#### Rounding Real-World Problems
Background context: Real-world problems often require different rounding strategies compared to theoretical ones. For instance, needing 2.2 cans of paint means you should round up to 3 cans.

:p How do you handle real-world rounding?
??x
For a job requiring 2.2 cans of paint, ensure you round up to the next whole number (3 cans) to make sure there's enough.

#### Guessing Strategy for ASVAB
Background context: On the ASVAB, guessing can improve your chances, especially if you have eliminated at least two wrong answers. Understand that guessing increases your odds of being correct.

:p How does the guessing strategy work on the ASVAB?
??x
If you don't guess, you have a 0% chance of getting the answer right; guessing with one possible answer eliminates (1/4) or 25% chance of success. Eliminating two wrong answers gives you a 50-50 shot.

#### ASVAB Subtest Guessing Rules
Background context: On the CAT-ASVAB, guessing incorrectly on multiple questions at the end can count against your score. However, overall, there's no penalty for guessing.

:p What is the rule about guessing on the ASVAB subtests?
??x
Guessing wrong on any part of the ASVAB doesn't penalize you; however, on the CAT-ASVAB, avoiding a bunch of incorrect guesses at the end can be beneficial.
