#### Exponent Rules and Simplification
Background context: Understanding how to simplify expressions involving exponents is crucial for solving mathematical problems. The basic rules of exponents include multiplication, division, power of a power, and negative exponents.

:p What is $x^2 \cdot 4x$?
??x
The expression simplifies as follows:
$$x^2 \cdot 4x = 4x^{2+1} = 4x^3$$

To break it down further:
- When multiplying terms with the same base, you add their exponents.
- $x^2 $ and$x $ are equivalent to$ x^1 $, so combining them gives $ x^{2+1} = x^3$.

No code is necessary for this particular problem. 
x??

---

#### Perimeter of a Rectangle
Background context: The perimeter of a rectangle can be calculated using the formula:
$$P = 2(l + w)$$where $ l $ is the length and $ w$ is the width.

:p What is the area of a rectangle with a perimeter of 36 feet and a width of 4 feet?
??x
First, we use the perimeter formula to find the length.$$P = 2(l + w)$$

Given:
- $P = 36 $-$ w = 4$ Substitute the values:
$$36 = 2(l + 4)$$

Solve for $l$:
$$18 = l + 4$$
$$l = 14 \text{ feet}$$

Now, calculate the area using the formula for the area of a rectangle:
$$

A = l \times w$$
$$

A = 14 \times 4 = 56 \text{ square feet}$$

So, the area is $56$ square feet.
x??

---

#### Cube Root
Background context: The cube root of a number $x $ is a value that when multiplied by itself three times equals$x $. It can be denoted as$\sqrt[3]{x}$.

:p What is the cube root of 64?
??x
The cube root of 64 is:
$$\sqrt[3]{64} = 4$$

To verify, we calculate:
$$4^3 = 4 \times 4 \times 4 = 64$$

Thus, the answer is $4$.
x??

x??

---

#### Reciprocal
Background context: The reciprocal of a number $x $ is defined as$\frac{1}{x}$.

:p What is the reciprocal of $\frac{1}{6}$?
??x
The reciprocal of $\frac{1}{6}$ is:
$$\frac{1}{\frac{1}{6}} = 6$$

To verify, multiplying them together gives:
$$\frac{1}{6} \times 6 = 1$$x??

---

#### Decimal Place Value
Background context: Understanding place values and decimal places helps in solving problems involving decimals.

:p What is the value of $x $ if$0.05x = 1$?
??x
To solve for $x$:
$$0.05x = 1$$

Divide both sides by 0.05:
$$x = \frac{1}{0.05}$$
$$x = 20$$

Therefore, the value of $x$ is 20.
x??

---

#### Factoring
Background context: Factoring polynomials involves expressing them as products of simpler polynomials.

:p Factor $x^2 + 69$.
??x
The expression given is:
$$x^2 + 69$$

This polynomial does not factor nicely over the integers. It can be written as a sum of squares, but it remains in its original form since there are no common factors or other simplifications possible.

Thus,$x^2 + 69$ cannot be factored further using standard methods.
x??

---

#### Exponent Equations
Background context: Solving equations involving exponents requires applying rules such as exponent addition and subtraction.

:p Solve for $x $: $3^{2}7^{2} = 64$.
??x
Given:
$$3^2 \cdot 7^2 = 64$$

First, simplify the left-hand side:
$$(3 \cdot 7)^2 = 64$$
$$21^2 = 64$$

Since $21^2 \neq 64$, we realize there might be a mistake in interpretation. Revisiting the equation reveals it should be:
$$(3x)2(7x)2 = 64$$
$$(21x)^2 = 64$$

Taking the square root of both sides:
$$21x = 8 \quad \text{or} \quad 21x = -8$$

Solving for $x$:
$$x = \frac{8}{21} \quad \text{or} \quad x = -\frac{8}{21}$$

Thus, the solutions are:
$$x = \frac{8}{21} \quad \text{and} \quad x = -\frac{8}{21}$$x??

---

#### Interest Calculation
Background context: The formula for calculating simple interest is $I = P \times r \times t $, where $ I $ is the interest, $ P $ is the principal amount, $ r $ is the rate of interest, and $ t$ is the time in years.

:p If the principal $P $ is$1000, the rate $ r$is 7% (or 0.07), and the time $ t$ is 1 year, what is the simple interest $ I$?
??x
Using the formula for simple interest:
$$I = P \times r \times t$$

Given:
- $P = 1000 $-$ r = 0.07 $-$ t = 1$ Substitute the values into the formula:
$$I = 1000 \times 0.07 \times 1$$
$$

I = 70$$

Therefore, the simple interest $I $ is$70.
x??

---

#### Solving Equations
Background context: Solving equations often involves isolating the variable on one side of the equation.

:p Solve for $x $: $ x + 4 = 12$.
??x
To solve for $x$:
$$x + 4 = 12$$

Subtract 4 from both sides:
$$x = 12 - 4$$
$$x = 8$$

Thus, the value of $x$ is 8.
x??

---

#### Circle Area Calculation
Background context: The area of a circle can be calculated using the formula $A = \pi r^2 $, where $ r$ is the radius.

:p What is the approximate area of a circle with a radius of 5 inches?
??x
Using the formula for the area of a circle:
$$A = \pi r^2$$

Given:
- $r = 5$ Substitute the value into the formula:
$$A = \pi (5)^2$$
$$

A = 25\pi$$

Using the approximate value of $\pi \approx 3.14$:
$$A \approx 25 \times 3.14 = 78.5 \text{ square inches}$$

Therefore, the area is approximately 78.5 square inches.
x??

---

#### Inequality Solving
Background context: Solving inequalities involves finding the range of values that satisfy a given inequality.

:p Solve the following inequality:$2 - x < 36 - 9x$.
??x
First, rearrange the inequality to isolate $x$:
$$2 - x < 36 - 9x$$

Add $9x$ to both sides:
$$2 + 8x < 36$$

Subtract 2 from both sides:
$$8x < 34$$

Divide by 8:
$$x < \frac{34}{8}$$
$$x < 4.25$$

Thus, the solution to the inequality is $x < 4.25$.
x??

---

#### Volume of a Cylinder
Background context: The volume of a cylinder can be calculated using the formula:
$$V = \pi r^2 h$$where $ r $ is the radius and $ h$ is the height.

:p What is the approximate volume of a cylindrical tube with a radius of 3 inches and a height of 5 inches?
??x
Using the formula for the volume of a cylinder:
$$V = \pi r^2 h$$

Given:
- $r = 3 $-$ h = 5$ Substitute the values into the formula:
$$V = \pi (3)^2 (5)$$
$$

V = \pi \times 9 \times 5$$
$$

V = 45\pi$$

Using the approximate value of $\pi \approx 3.14$:
$$V \approx 45 \times 3.14 = 141.3 \text{ cubic inches}$$

Thus, the volume is approximately 141 cubic inches.
x??

:p Identify the type of angle shown below.
??x
From the diagram, we observe that the angle is less than 90 degrees:
$$\text{Acute angle}$$x??

#### Sum of Integers
Background context: The sum of the first $n$ positive integers can be found using the formula:
$$S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}$$:p What is the sum of the first 314,000 positive integers?
??x
Using the sum formula for the first $n$ positive integers:
$$S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}$$

Given:
- $n = 314,000$ Substitute the value into the formula:
$$S = \frac{314,000(314,000 + 1)}{2}$$
$$

S = \frac{314,000 \times 314,001}{2}$$

Calculating this gives:
$$

S = 49,178,500,000$$

Therefore, the sum is $49,178,500,000$.
