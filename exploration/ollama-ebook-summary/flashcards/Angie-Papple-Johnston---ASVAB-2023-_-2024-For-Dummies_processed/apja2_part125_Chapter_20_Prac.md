The code example demonstrates how a simple function can be used to print out a flashcard question and answer. In real usage, you would replace the placeholder text with your actual flashcards. --- 
```java
public class Example {
    // Print a flashcard method (not actually used here)
    public static void printFlashcard(String q, String a) {
        System.out.println(q);
        System.out.println("Answer: " + a);
    }
}
```
x?? 

The code example provides a utility function that can be used to format and display flashcards. In your application or study session, you would call this method with the appropriate question and answer parameters. --- 
```java
public class Example {
    // Print multiple flashcards
    public static void printFlashcard(String q1, String a1) {
        System.out.println(q1);
        System.out.println("Answer: " + a1);
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        printFlashcard("What is the supplement of a 55-degree angle?", "125 degrees");
    }
}
```
x?? 
The code example shows how to use the `printFlashcard` method to display multiple flashcards. In this case, it prints a single flashcard about supplementary angles for demonstration purposes. --- 
```java
public class Example {
    // Print another set of flashcards
    public static void printFlashcard(String q2, String a2) {
        System.out.println(q2);
        System.out.println("Answer: " + a2);
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        printFlashcard("How many pieces of lumber are in a stack that is 6 feet high, with each piece being 4 inches thick?", "72");
    }
}
```
x?? 
The code example demonstrates another call to the `printFlashcard` method, this time for a problem involving the calculation of stacked lumber. --- 
```java
public class Example {
    // Print all flashcards in sequence
    public static void printAllFlashcards() {
        System.out.println("What is the supplement of a 55-degree angle?");
        System.out.println("Answer: 125 degrees");
        
        System.out.println("How many pieces of lumber are in a stack that is 6 feet high, with each piece being 4 inches thick?");
        System.out.println("Answer: 72");
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        printAllFlashcards();
    }
}
```

The code example demonstrates how to print all flashcards in sequence. In a real application, you would replace the placeholder text with your actual set of flashcard questions and answers. This utility method can be called at the start or end of a study session to review all the flashcards.
```java
public class Example {
    // Print multiple sets of flashcards
    public static void printAllFlashcards() {

The code example demonstrates how to use the `printAllFlashcards` method to display all flashcards in sequence. This utility can be used to review multiple concepts comprehensively at the start or end of a study session.
```java
public class Example {
    // Print all flashcards in sequence
    public static void printAllFlashcards() {
        System.out.println("What is the supplement of a 55-degree angle?");
        System.out.println("Answer: 125 degrees");
        
        System.out.println("How many pieces of lumber are in a stack that is 6 feet high, with each piece being 4 inches thick?");
        System.out.println("Answer: 72");
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        printAllFlashcards();
    }
}
