#### Cost Calculation for Donuts
Background context: The problem involves calculating the profit made from selling donuts. The cost and selling price are given, and the task is to find the overall profit.

:p Calculate the profit made by a baker who sells five dozen donuts if each dozen costs $3.99 to make and sells for$8.00.
??x
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:
1. Determine the cost of making one dozen donuts: $\$0.45$.
2. Calculate the total cost of making five dozen donuts by multiplying the cost per dozen by 5.
3. Find the selling price for five dozen donuts by multiplying the selling price per dozen by 5.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

Let's go through these steps:

1. **Cost per Dozen:**
   $$
   \text{Cost of making one dozen} = \$0.45
   $$2. **Total Cost for Five Dozen:**$$
   \text{Total cost for five dozen} = 0.45 \times 5 = \$2.25
   $$3. **Selling Price for Five Dozen:**$$
   \text{Selling price of one dozen} = \$8.00
   $$$$
   \text{Total selling price for five dozen} = 8.00 \times 5 = \$40.00
   $$4. **Profit Calculation:**$$\text{Profit} = \text{Total Selling Price} - \text{Total Cost}$$$$
   \text{Profit} = 40.00 - 2.25 = \$37.75
   $$

The profit made by the baker is **$37.75**.

```plaintext
Cost per dozen: $0.45
Total cost for five dozen: $2.25
Selling price for five dozen: $40.00
Profit: $40.00 -$2.25 =$37.75

#### Equation Solving with Dimes and Quarters
Background context: The problem involves setting up and solving an equation to find the number of dimes, given a total value in cents.

:p Solve for $x $ where$100x $ is the number of quarters and the total amount in dollars is$19.75.
??x
To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the values provided:

- Let $x$ be the number of dimes.
- The value of the dimes is $0.10x$ (in dollars).
- The value of the quarters is $0.25(100x) = 25x$ (in dollars).

The total amount in dollars is $19.75, so we can set up the following equation:

$$0.10x + 25x = 19.75$$

First, combine like terms on the left side of the equation:
$$0.10x + 25x = 25.10x$$
$$25.10x = 19.75$$

Next, solve for $x$:

$$x = \frac{19.75}{25.10}$$

Using a calculator:
$$x \approx 0.7864$$

Since the number of dimes must be an integer, we need to check if this makes sense in context. Given that $x $ is approximately 0.79, it means there are not enough dimes or quarters to make exactly$19.75 without rounding errors.

However, for exact calculations, use the exact value:

$$x = \frac{1975}{2510} = \frac{395}{502}$$

The number of dimes is $x = 0.7864$, which isn't an integer.

```plaintext
Equation: 0.10x + 25x = 19.75
Solution: x ≈ 0.7864
```

#### Area Calculation for Patio
Background context: The problem involves calculating the area of a rectangular patio and then finding the cost to cover it with bricks.

:p Calculate the total cost if a bricklayer charges $8 per square foot to lay bricks on a 12-foot by 16-foot patio.
??x
To find the total cost, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the area of the patio:**
   - The dimensions are 12 feet by 16 feet.
   - Area is calculated as:
     $$\text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width}$$$$\text{Area} = 12 \, \text{feet} \times 16 \, \text{feet} = 192 \, \text{square feet}$$2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - The bricklayer charges$8 per square foot.
   - Total cost is:
     $$\text{Total Cost} = \text{Area} \times \text{Cost per Square Foot}$$$$
     \text{Total Cost} = 192 \, \text{square feet} \times 8 \, \text{\$/square foot} = \$1536
     $$

The total cost for the bricklayer to lay bricks on the patio is **$1536**.

```plaintext
Area of patio: 12 ft * 16 ft = 192 square feet
Cost per square foot: $8
Total Cost: 192 sq ft * $8/sq ft =$1536
```

#### Hourly Wage Calculation for Angie, Tim, and Terry
Background context: The problem involves setting up an equation to find the hourly wage of Angie based on her coworkers' wages.

:p Solve for $x $ where$x $ is Angie's hourly wage,$x^2 $ is Tim’s hourly wage, and$3x$ is Terry’s hourly wage.
??x
To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given:

- Let $x$ be Angie's hourly wage.
- Tim’s hourly wage is $x^2$.
- Terry’s hourly wage is $3x$.

We are given that the sum of their wages equals $64 per hour. So, we can write the equation as follows:

$$x + x^2 + 3x = 64$$

Combine like terms:
$$x^2 + 4x = 64$$

Rearrange to form a standard quadratic equation:
$$x^2 + 4x - 64 = 0$$

To solve this quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $ a = 1$,$ b = 4 $, and$ c = -64$.

Calculate the discriminant:

$$b^2 - 4ac = 4^2 - 4(1)(-64) = 16 + 256 = 272$$

Now, use the quadratic formula:
$$x = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{272}}{2}$$

Simplify $\sqrt{272}$:

$$\sqrt{272} = \sqrt{16 \times 17} = 4\sqrt{17}$$

So,$$x = \frac{-4 \pm 4\sqrt{17}}{2} = -2 \pm 2\sqrt{17}$$

Since hourly wage must be a positive number, we take the positive root:
$$x = -2 + 2\sqrt{17}$$

Approximating $\sqrt{17} \approx 4.123$:

$$x \approx -2 + 2(4.123) = -2 + 8.246 = 6.246$$

Thus, Angie's hourly wage is approximately **$6.25**.

```plaintext
Equation: x^2 + 4x - 64 = 0
Solution using quadratic formula:
x = (-4 ± sqrt(16 + 256)) / 2
x ≈ -2 + 2 * 4.123 ≈ $6.25
```

#### Machine Operation for Two People
Background context: The problem involves determining how many machines two people can run, knowing that four people can run eight machines.

:p Determine how many machines two people can run if four people can run eight machines.
??x
To determine how many machines two people can run, we start by understanding the ratio of people to machines. 

- Four people can run eight machines.

This means each person runs:

$$\frac{8 \text{ machines}}{4 \text{ people}} = 2 \text{ machines per person}$$

Now, for two people, since each person runs 2 machines, the total number of machines that two people can run is:
$$2 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ machines per person} = 4 \text{ machines}$$

Therefore, two people can run **four machines**.

```plaintext
Four people run eight machines.
Each person runs: 8/4 = 2 machines/person.
Two people run: 2 * 2 = 4 machines.
```

#### Ticket Purchase Decision for Daily and Seasonal Tickets
Background context: The problem involves comparing the cost of daily tickets versus a season ticket to determine which is more economical.

:p Determine the minimum number of times you would need to use a daily ticket before it becomes cheaper than a season ticket, given that a daily ticket costs$240 and can be used up to 36 times.
??x
To solve this problem, we need to find out how many times you must use the daily ticket for its cost per use to be less than the cost of using the season ticket.

- The daily ticket costs $\$240$ and can be used up to 36 times. Therefore, the cost per use is:
$$\text{Cost per use} = \frac{240}{x}$$where $ x$ is the number of uses.

- The season ticket costs $\$240$, so its cost per use is:

$$\text{Season ticket cost per use} = 240$$

We need to find the minimum value of $x$ such that:
$$\frac{240}{x} < 240$$

This simplifies to finding when the daily ticket's usage exceeds 36 times. We set up the equation and solve for $x$:

$$240 = 240 \times \frac{x}{240}$$
$$1 = \frac{x}{240}$$

Since we need to use it more than 36 times, we check:
$$x > 36$$

Thus, you would need to use the daily ticket more than 36 times for it to be cheaper. The smallest integer greater than 36 is 37.

Therefore, you would need to use the daily ticket at least **37 times** for it to be cheaper than a season ticket.

```plaintext
Daily ticket cost:$240, can be used up to 36 times.
Season ticket cost: $240.
Cost per daily ticket usage: 240/x.
Season ticket cost per use: 240.
Find the minimum x such that:
240/x < 240
This is satisfied when x > 36, so at least 37 times.
```

#### Pipe Length Conversion and Calculation
Background context: The problem involves converting lengths from feet and inches to just inches and then calculating the total length needed in feet.

:p Convert 3 feet, 6 inches into feet and calculate how many pipes of this length are needed if you need a total of 435 inches.
??x
To solve this problem, follow these steps:

1. **Convert 3 feet, 6 inches to just inches:**
   - There are 12 inches in one foot.
   $$3 \text{ feet} = 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ inches}$$

Adding the additional 6 inches:
$$36 + 6 = 42 \text{ inches}$$2. **Calculate how many pipes of this length are needed for a total of 435 inches:**
   - Each pipe is 42 inches long.
   - Divide the total required inches by the length of one pipe:
$$\frac{435}{42} \approx 10.36$$

Since you can't use a fraction of a pipe, round up to the next whole number:
$$11 \text{ pipes}$$

Therefore, **you need 11 pipes**.

```plaintext
Convert: 3 feet = 3 * 12 = 36 inches.
Total length in inches: 42 + 6 = 48 inches.
Number of pipes needed: 435 / 42 ≈ 10.36, round up to 11.
```

??x
The formula used to find the diagonal of a rectangle is $d = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2}$. Here,$ l $and$ w$ represent the length and width of the rectangle respectively. This formula stems from the Pythagorean theorem applied to a right-angled triangle formed by two sides of the rectangle and its diagonal.

```java
public class RectangleDiagonal {
    public static double findDiagonal(double length, double width) {
        return Math.sqrt(Math.pow(length, 2) + Math.pow(width, 2));
    }
}

#### Converting Inches to Miles
Background context: The problem involves converting a map scale (in inches) to actual distance (in miles). The given information is that 2 inches on the map equals 3 miles in real life. Therefore, we can use this ratio to convert any measurement from the map to its corresponding real-life distance.

:p How do you convert inches to miles using the given map scale?
??x
To convert inches to miles using the given map scale, first determine the number of miles per inch. Given that 2 inches on the map equals 3 miles in reality, we can find the miles per inch by dividing the total miles by the total inches:$\frac{3 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ inches}} = 1.5 \text{ miles/inch}$.

Then, to convert any number of inches on the map to actual distance in miles, multiply the number of inches by 1.5.

For example:
```java
public class InchToMileConverter {
    public static double convertInchesToMiles(double inches) {
        return inches * 1.5;
    }
}
```

#### Number of Bolts in a Bin
Background context: The problem involves calculating the number of bolts in a bin, given the total capacity and a fraction of that capacity.

:p How do you calculate the number of bolts in a bin?
??x
The number of bolts in a bin is calculated by multiplying the total capacity of the bin by the fraction filled. If a full bin can hold 128 bolts and it's only $\frac{1}{6}$ full, then:
$$\text{Number of bolts} = 128 \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{128}{6} = \frac{64}{3} \approx 21.33$$

Since we cannot have a fraction of a bolt in this context, the number of bolts is approximately 21.

#### Meeting Point of Two Bikes
Background context: The problem involves calculating the meeting point of two bikes traveling towards each other, given their speeds and a head start.

:p How do you calculate the time taken for two bikes to meet?
??x
To find the time taken for two bikes to meet, first determine the relative speed at which they are closing the gap. If Bike 1 is going 26 mph and Bike 2 is going 14 mph, their combined speed (relative speed) is:
$$\text{Relative Speed} = 26 + 14 = 40 \text{ mph}$$

The initial distance between them is $5 \frac{1}{5}$ miles. To find the time $t$ it takes for them to meet, use the formula:
$$t = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}}$$

So,$$t = \frac{5.2}{40} = 0.13 \text{ hours}$$

Convert this time into minutes by multiplying by 60:
$$0.13 \times 60 = 7.8 \text{ minutes} \approx 8 \text{ minutes}$$

Since the second bike left at 2:09, they will meet approximately 8 minutes later, which is around 2:17.

:p What is the weight difference between a crate weighing 60 pounds, 5 ounces and a puppy weighing 43 pounds, 7 ounces?
??x
First, convert 60 pounds, 5 ounces to all ounces:
$$60 \text{ pounds} \times 16 + 5 = 965 \text{ ounces}$$

Next, subtract the weight of the puppy in ounces:
$$965 - (43 \times 16 + 7) = 965 - (688 + 7) = 965 - 695 = 270 \text{ ounces}$$

Finally, convert back to pounds and ounces:
$$270 \div 16 = 16 \text{ R } 14$$

So the difference is 16 pounds, 14 ounces.

??x
First, calculate the area of each bedroom:
$$12 \times 14 = 168$$
$$12 \times 10 = 120$$
$$8 \times 12 = 96$$
$$16 \times 8 = 128$$

Sum the areas:
$$168 + 120 + 96 + 128 = 492 \text{ square feet}$$

Convert to square yards (since 1 square yard = 9 square feet):
$$\frac{492}{9} = 54.67$$

Rounding up, you need approximately 55 square yards.
