$$\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of Dimes}}{\text{Total Number of Coins}} = \frac{5}{20} = \frac{1}{4}$$

In decimal form:$0.25$, which is equivalent to 25%.

```java
// Pseudocode for calculating the probability
int dimes = 5;
int totalCoins = 20;

double probability = (double) dimes / totalCoins; // Calculate the probability as a decimal
```

#### Percent Increase

**Background context:** The percent increase is calculated by finding the difference between the new and original values, dividing that difference by the original value, and then multiplying by 100 to convert it to a percentage.

:p What is the percent increase from $500 to$75?

??x
The formula for percent increase is:

$$\text{Percent Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New Value} - \text{Original Value}}{\text{Original Value}} \right) \times 100$$

For the given values:
- Original Value:$500
- New Value: $75

Substituting these into the formula:

$$\text{Percent Increase} = \left( \frac{75 - 500}{500} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{-425}{500} \right) \times 100 = -85\%$$

However, typically we consider only the positive increase:
$$\text{Percent Increase} = \left( \frac{75 - 500}{-500} \right) \times 100 = 14.5\%$$

Therefore, the percent increase is $14.5\%$.

```java
// Pseudocode for calculating the percent increase
double originalValue = 500;
double newValue = 75;

double percentIncrease = ((newValue - originalValue) / originalValue) * 100; // Calculate the percent increase
```

#### Distance Formula

**Background context:** The distance formula is used to calculate the distance between two points in a coordinate plane. It is derived from the Pythagorean theorem and takes the form $d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$.

:p A woman walks for 12 minutes at a speed of 5 miles per hour. How far does she walk?

??x
To find the distance walked, we can use the formula $d = r \times t $, where $ d $ is distance, $ r $ is rate (or speed), and $ t$ is time.

First, convert the time from minutes to hours:
$$12 \text{ minutes} = \frac{12}{60} \text{ hours} = 0.2 \text{ hours}$$

Now, apply the distance formula with a speed of 5 miles per hour and 0.2 hours:
$$d = r \times t = 5 \text{ mph} \times 0.2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ mile}$$

Therefore, she walks 1 mile.

```java
// Pseudocode for calculating distance using the formula d = r * t
double speed = 5; // miles per hour
double timeInHours = 12 / 60; // converting minutes to hours

double distance = speed * timeInHours; // Calculate the distance
```

#### Supplemental Angles and Complementary Angles

**Background context:** Supplementary angles add up to 180 degrees, while complementary angles add up to 90 degrees. The problem involves finding a specific angle based on given relationships.

:p If angle P measures 44°, what is the measure of its supplement?

??x
To find the supplement of an angle, subtract the angle's measurement from 180°:
$$\text{Supplement} = 180^\circ - 44^\circ = 136^\circ$$

Therefore, the supplement of angle P is $136^\circ$.

```java
// Pseudocode for calculating the supplement of an angle
int angleP = 44;

int supplementOfAngleP = 180 - angleP; // Calculate the supplement
```

#### Team Points Calculation

**Background context:** This problem involves understanding fractions and percentages, specifically how to calculate the percentage of points scored by a team's players.

:p Rose scored 36 out of 50 points. Carla scored 42% of the total team points. Together, they scored 67% of the total points. What percentage of points did the team not score?

??x
First, calculate the fraction of points scored by Rose:

$$\text{Fraction of Points Scored by Rose} = \frac{36}{50} = 0.72$$

Next, let's represent the problem in terms of percentages:
- Rose:$0.72 $ or$72\%$- Carla:$42\%$- Together with Carla and Rose:$67\%$ To find the percentage of points not scored by either player, subtract their combined score from 100%:
$$\text{Percentage Not Scored} = 100\% - 67\% = 33\%$$

Therefore, the team did not score $33\%$.

```java
// Pseudocode for calculating the percentage of points not scored by Rose and Carla
int totalPoints = 50;
int roseScore = 36;

double rosePercentage = (double) roseScore / totalPoints; // Calculate Rose's percentage

double carlaPercentage = 42.0 / 100; // Carla's percentage as a decimal

// Together, they scored 67%
double combinedPercentage = 67.0 / 100;

// Percentage not scored
double notScoredPercentage = (1 - combinedPercentage) * 100; // Calculate the remaining percentage

System.out.println("Not Scored Percentage: " + notScoredPercentage + "%");
```

#### Distance Between Two Runners

**Background context:** This problem involves using the distance formula to find the distance between two runners after a certain amount of time. It also involves alternative methods like finding their relative speed.

:p John and Garret start running at 3:00 PM. John runs at 3.5 mph and Garret runs at 4.25 mph. How far apart are they after 2 hours?

??x
To find the distance between them, we use the formula $d = r \times t$ for both runners.

- Distance covered by John: 
$$d_{\text{John}} = 3.5 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 7 \text{ miles}$$- Distance covered by Garret:
$$d_{\text{Garret}} = 4.25 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 8.5 \text{ miles}$$

The difference in distance between them is:
$$\text{Distance apart} = 8.5 \text{ miles} - 7 \text{ miles} = 1.5 \text{ miles}$$

Alternatively, we can find their relative speed and multiply it by the time:
- Relative speed:
$$\text{Relative Speed} = 4.25 \text{ mph} - 3.5 \text{ mph} = 0.75 \text{ mph}$$

Distance apart after 2 hours:
$$\text{Distance apart} = 0.75 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ miles}$$

Therefore, they are $1.5$ miles apart.

```java
// Pseudocode for calculating the distance between two runners using relative speed
double johnSpeed = 3.5; // mph
double garretSpeed = 4.25; // mph
double time = 2; // hours

double relativeSpeed = garretSpeed - johnSpeed; // Calculate relative speed

// Distance apart after 2 hours
double distanceApart = relativeSpeed * time;
```

#### Repair Time Calculation

**Background context:** This problem involves finding the combined work rate of two people to complete a task. It requires understanding fractions and solving for a common unit of time.

:p Jim takes 2 hours to repair a heating unit, while Kyle takes 3 hours. How long will it take them working together?

??x
To solve this, we need to find their combined work rate. First, convert their times into rates (fraction of the task per hour):

- Jim's rate:
$$\text{Jim's Rate} = \frac{1}{2}$$- Kyle's rate:
$$\text{Kyle's Rate} = \frac{1}{3}$$

Combined rate is the sum of their individual rates:
$$\text{Combined Rate} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{3}{6} + \frac{2}{6} = \frac{5}{6}$$

This means together they can complete $\frac{5}{6}$ of the task per hour. To find how long it takes to complete 1 whole unit:
$$\text{Time} = \frac{1}{\left( \frac{5}{6} \right)} = \frac{6}{5} \text{ hours}$$

Converting this time into minutes:
$$\frac{6}{5} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 72 \text{ minutes}$$

So, working together, they will take $1 $ hour and$12 $ minutes (since$72 - 60 = 12$) to complete the task.

```java
// Pseudocode for calculating combined work rate
double jimTimeInHours = 2; // hours
double kyleTimeInHours = 3; // hours

// Combined rate per hour
double combinedRate = (1 / jimTimeInHours) + (1 / kyleTimeInHours);

// Time to complete the task together
double timeToComplete = 1 / combinedRate;

// Convert time into minutes for final answer
int totalTimeInMinutes = (int) (timeToComplete * 60);
```

#### Square Root and Perimeter Calculation

**Background context:** This problem involves finding the side length of a square given its area, then calculating the perimeter using that side length. It requires understanding how to take the square root of a number.

:p A square has an area of 121 square units. What is the perimeter?

??x
To find the side length of the square, we take the square root of the area:

$$\text{Side Length} = \sqrt{121} = 11$$

Now that we have the side length, we can calculate the perimeter by multiplying it by 4 (since a square has four equal sides):
$$\text{Perimeter} = 4 \times \text{Side Length} = 4 \times 11 = 44$$

Therefore, the perimeter is $44$ units.

```java
// Pseudocode for calculating side length and perimeter of a square
double area = 121; // Area in square units

// Calculate side length
double sideLength = Math.sqrt(area);

// Calculate perimeter
double perimeter = 4 * sideLength;
```

#### Problem Solving: Water Mixture
Background context explaining the problem, which involves setting up and solving an equation to find the amount of water needed to dilute a mixture from 20% juice concentration to a desired level. The goal is to understand how to set up and solve equations involving mixtures.
:p What is the question about this concept?
??x
The question asks for the amount of water,$x$, that needs to be added to a 20% juice mixture to achieve a specific concentration. The setup involves creating an equation based on the concentration before and after adding the water.

Given:
- Initial juice concentration: 20%
- Juice quantity in initial mixture: 420 units
- Water quantity needed: $100x$ units
- Desired total mixture volume: $50 + 4x$ units

The equation to solve is:
$$100 + 420 = 50 + 4x$$

Solve for $x$:
```java
// Define the variables
int initialJuice = 420;
int waterAdded = 100 * x; // where x is the unknown variable

// Desired total mixture volume
int desiredTotalVolume = 50 + 4 * x;

// Equation setup: initial juice + added water = desired total volume
x = (initialJuice - 100) / 4;
```
The value of $x$ can be calculated as:
$$x = \frac{420 - 100}{4} = 80$$

Thus, the amount of water to add is 80 units.
