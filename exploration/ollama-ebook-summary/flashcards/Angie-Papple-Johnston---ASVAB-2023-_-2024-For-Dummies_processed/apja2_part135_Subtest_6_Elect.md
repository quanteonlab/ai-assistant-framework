Choice (C) does not feature a triangle at all, but there is one in the original diagram. Therefore, it cannot be correct and should be eliminated from consideration.

#### Rotational vs Inversion
Explanation of how to differentiate between rotational transformations and inversions in diagrams.

:p Why can Choice (B) be excluded when matching figures?
??x
Choice (B) contains an inverted version of the shape containing Point A, which is not allowed on the ASVAB. Only rotations are permitted, so this choice can be excluded.

#### Matching Larger Shapes and Triangles
Explanation of how to match larger shapes and triangles in diagrams by comparing their dimensions and presence.

:p Why is Choice (A) incorrect when matching figures?
??x
Choice (A)'s largest triangle does not match the original figure's largest triangle, making it an incorrect choice.

#### Identifying Correct Border Dimensions
Explanation of how to verify border dimensions to ensure accuracy in diagram comparisons.

:p How do you determine that Choice (B) is incorrect based on borders?
??x
Choice (B)'s borders have the wrong dimensions, particularly the largest border piece. This mismatch makes it an incorrect choice.

#### Matching Figures with Rotational Differences
Explanation of how to identify and match figures by considering rotational differences.

:p Why is Choice (C) incorrect when matching Point A's figure?
??x
Point A in the original diagram is on the lower corner of the straight edge, which does not match Choice (C). Instead, you can see that Choice (A) is correctly oriented.

#### Excluding Continuous Double-Lined Edges
Explanation of how to exclude options with continuous double-lined edges as they do not match the original image.

:p Why can Choice (B) be excluded when matching outer edges?
??x
Choice (B)'s double-lined outer edge is a continuous shape, which does not match the original image. This makes it an incorrect choice.

#### Matching Interior Shapes and Dimensions
Explanation of how to verify interior shapes and dimensions for accurate matching.

:p Why can Choice (A) be excluded when comparing interior shapes?
??x
Choice (A)'s interior shapes have different dimensions than those in the original diagram, making it an incorrect choice. Choice (C), however, accurately matches all elements.

#### Verifying Curved Shapes on Upper Part
Explanation of how to check for curved shapes that do not match the original image.

:p Why can Choice (D) be excluded when matching upper part features?
??x
Choice (D) has two curved shapes in the upper part, but these do not appear in the original figure. Therefore, it is incorrect.
