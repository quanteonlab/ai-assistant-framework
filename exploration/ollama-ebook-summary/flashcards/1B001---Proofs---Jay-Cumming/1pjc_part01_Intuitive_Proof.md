#### Perfect Cover of an 8×8 Chessboard
Background context: The text discusses how to cover a standard 8×8 chessboard using dominoes (2×1 blocks) without any gaps or overlaps. It introduces the concept of a "perfect cover" and provides examples of such covers.
:p What is a perfect cover in the context of an 8×8 chessboard?
??x
A perfect cover is an arrangement of dominoes on the 8×8 chessboard where each domino covers exactly two squares, leaving no square uncovered, and no dominoes are stacked or hanging off the board. The example given shows how to arrange 32 dominoes to perfectly cover all 64 squares.
x??

#### Proof Idea: Existence of Perfect Cover
Background context: The text outlines a proof idea that involves demonstrating the existence of at least one perfect cover for an 8×8 chessboard by providing an example. This approach is used to prove the proposition that such a cover exists.
:p What is the key idea behind proving the existence of a perfect cover?
??x
The key idea is to provide an explicit example of a perfect cover, thereby demonstrating that at least one such arrangement exists. This method relies on showing "there exists" something by actually constructing it.
x??

#### Proof: Perfect Cover for 8×8 Chessboard
Background context: The text presents a formal proof of the existence of a perfect cover for an 8×8 chessboard, using an example to fulfill the requirement that such a cover must exist. It ends with a Halmos tombstone symbolizing the completion of the argument.
:p What is the proof structure used to show the existence of a perfect cover?
??x
The proof uses a direct construction approach by providing an example of a perfect cover. The proof concludes with the Halmos tombstone, indicating that the argument is complete.

```java
// Example code to illustrate the placement of dominoes (pseudocode)
public class PerfectCover {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        char[][] board = new char[8][8];
        
        // Placing dominoes in a perfect cover pattern
        for (int i = 0; i < 8; i += 2) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 7; j += 2) {
                board[i][j] = 'D'; // First half of the domino
                board[i+1][j+1] = 'd'; // Second half of the domino
            }
        }

        // Print the board to verify the perfect cover
        for (char[] row : board) {
            System.out.println(new String(row));
        }
    }
}
```

#### Number of Perfect Covers on 8×8 Chessboard
Background context: The text mentions that there are exactly 12,988,816 different perfect covers for an 8×8 chessboard. This number was determined in 1961 without the use of modern computational methods.
:p How many perfect covers exist for an 8×8 chessboard?
??x
There are exactly 12,988,816 different perfect covers for an 8×8 chessboard. This number represents all possible ways to perfectly cover the board with dominoes without any gaps or overlaps.
x??

#### Covering a Modified Chessboard
Background context: The text discusses whether it is still possible to cover a modified 8×8 chessboard (with two squares removed) using dominoes, specifically removing the bottom-left and top-left squares. This introduces a new problem that differs from the original perfect cover scenario.
:p Can we perfectly cover an 8×8 chessboard with two squares removed?
??x
No, it is not possible to perfectly cover an 8×8 chessboard with two specific squares (bottom-left and top-left) removed using dominoes. This is because removing these squares leaves an odd number of black and white squares, making it impossible to pair them all up without leaving any uncovered.

Each flashcard covers a distinct concept from the provided text, ensuring that each question has only one focus while maintaining context and explanations.

#### Parity and Domino Covering on a Chessboard
Background context explaining the concept. In the provided text, it is discussed how the parity (evenness or oddness) of the number of squares affects whether they can be perfectly covered by dominoes. A key insight is that each domino covers 2 squares, which means any perfect covering must cover an even number of squares.

:p Can you explain why a standard 8x8 chessboard minus one square cannot be perfectly covered with dominoes?
??x
The answer is based on the fact that a single removed square makes the total number of remaining squares (63) odd, while each domino covers two squares. Hence, it's impossible to cover an odd number of squares with even-numbered groups (dominos).

Code examples are not directly applicable here as they pertain more to logical reasoning and proof construction rather than coding.
x??

---

#### Parity and Domino Covering on a Chessboard with Two Crossed-Out Squares
Background context explaining the concept. The text extends the discussion to an 8x8 chessboard where two squares (the top-left and bottom-right) are removed, making a total of 62 squares.

:p Can you explain why removing two specific squares from an 8x8 chessboard still makes it impossible to perfectly cover with dominoes?
??x
The answer is that even after removing the top-left and bottom-right squares, we have 62 squares left. Since each domino covers exactly 2 squares, any perfect covering must involve an even number of squares. However, 62 is still an even number, so the problem lies in the initial setup where every domino placement leaves a pattern that cannot perfectly fit with just two crossed-out squares.

Code examples are not directly applicable here as they pertain more to logical reasoning and proof construction rather than coding.
x??

---

#### Domino Covering on a Chessboard with General Parity Considerations
Background context explaining the concept. The provided text discusses how dominoes can only cover an even number of squares, which is derived from the fact that each domino covers two squares. This general parity rule applies to any board where the total square count minus the crossed-out ones results in an odd or even number.

:p Why does removing one or more specific squares from a chessboard affect whether it can be perfectly covered with dominoes?
??x
The answer lies in the parity of the remaining squares. Each domino covers two squares, making any perfect covering involve an even number of squares. Removing squares changes this parity; if the resulting square count is odd (as seen when one or more specific squares are removed), it cannot be perfectly covered with dominoes.

Code examples are not directly applicable here as they pertain more to logical reasoning and proof construction rather than coding.
x??

---

#### Domino Covering and Parity on an 8x8 Chessboard
Background context explaining the concept. The text provides a detailed explanation of why an 8x8 chessboard minus one or two specific squares cannot be perfectly covered with dominoes, focusing on parity (evenness vs. oddness) as the key factor.

:p Can you explain the role of parity in determining if a chessboard can be perfectly covered by dominoes?
??x
The answer is that each domino covers exactly 2 squares, making any perfect covering involve an even number of squares. When one or more specific squares are removed from an otherwise standard 8x8 chessboard (which has 64 squares), the parity changes such that it's impossible to cover all remaining squares with dominoes.

Code examples are not directly applicable here as they pertain more to logical reasoning and proof construction rather than coding.
x??

---

#### General Parity Rule for Domino Covering
Background context explaining the concept. The text explains a general rule that any perfect covering of a board by dominoes must involve an even number of squares, derived from each domino covering 2 squares.

:p Why does the parity (evenness or oddness) of the total number of squares play such a critical role in determining if a chessboard can be perfectly covered with dominoes?
??x
The answer is that because each domino covers exactly two squares, any perfect covering must involve an even number of squares. If removing specific squares from a board results in an odd number of remaining squares (as seen in the examples provided), it cannot be perfectly covered by dominoes.

Code examples are not directly applicable here as they pertain more to logical reasoning and proof construction rather than coding.
x??

---

#### Proof Structure for Domino Covering
Background context explaining the concept. The text provides a structured proof of why an 8x8 chessboard minus one or two specific squares cannot be perfectly covered with dominoes, using formal logic and mathematical rigor.

:p Can you outline the structure of the formal proof provided in the text?
??x
The answer is that the proof begins by stating the number of squares each domino covers (2) and then generalizes that any perfect covering must involve an even number of squares. It notes that removing specific squares from a standard 8x8 chessboard results in either 63 or 62 remaining squares, both odd numbers. Since it's impossible to cover an odd number of squares with even-numbered groups (dominos), the proof concludes that these configurations cannot be perfectly covered.

Code examples are not directly applicable here as they pertain more to logical reasoning and proof construction rather than coding.

#### Intuitive Proofs and Problem Solving
Background context: This section introduces problem-solving techniques, particularly focusing on intuitive proofs. It suggests using smaller examples to tackle larger problems and emphasizes the importance of actively engaging with the material.

:p What is an effective strategy for tackling a large problem that seems overwhelming?
??x
An effective strategy is to start by solving a smaller version of the same problem. This can help in understanding the structure and potential solutions before attempting the full-scale problem.
x??

---

#### Chessboard and Domino Covering Problem
Background context: The text presents a specific problem where the top-left and bottom-right squares of an 8×8 chessboard are removed, asking if it is possible to cover the remaining squares with dominoes.

:p What is the minimum number of dominoes required to cover all but two squares on an 8x8 chessboard?
??x
The minimum number of dominoes required is 31. Since each domino covers 2 squares, and we are removing 2 squares, we need $\frac{62}{2} = 31$ dominoes to cover the remaining 62 squares.
x??

---

#### Proof by Contradiction
Background context: The text uses a proof by contradiction to show that it is impossible to perfectly cover an 8×8 chessboard with the top-left and bottom-right squares removed using dominoes.

:p How does the proof by contradiction work in this case?
??x
The proof works by assuming the opposite of what we want to prove: that there exists a perfect covering with 31 dominoes. Then it shows why this assumption leads to a contradiction.
x??

---

#### Color Analysis in Proof
Background context: The text explains how analyzing colors on the chessboard helps to determine whether a perfect cover is possible or not.

:p Why do we need to consider the color of the squares when trying to solve the domino covering problem?
??x
We need to consider the color of the squares because each domino covers one white and one black square. The imbalance in the number of white and black squares after removing two specific ones (both white) means that it is impossible for 31 dominoes to cover them all.
x??

---

#### Importance of Intuition
Background context: The text highlights the importance of intuition in discovering proofs, alongside logical reasoning.

:p Why is intuition important when learning mathematics?
??x
Intuition helps in identifying patterns and making conjectures that can guide the development of rigorous proofs. While proofs run on logic, often following one's intuitive understanding leads to insights that facilitate the creation of formal arguments.
x??

---

#### Active Learning
Background context: The text stresses the importance of active engagement with problems through practice and experimentation.

:p What does the text suggest as a way to engage more actively with mathematical problems?
??x
The text suggests trying smaller examples of the problem, such as working with 4×4 or 8×8 boards where some squares are removed, before tackling the full-scale problem.
x??

---

#### Proof Structure and Clarity
Background context: The text discusses the structure and clarity required in proofs, emphasizing that pictures should complement rather than replace written explanations.

:p What is a key aspect of effective proof writing according to the text?
??x
A key aspect of effective proof writing is ensuring that the proof is 100 percent complete without relying solely on pictures. Pictures can aid understanding but must be used carefully to avoid missing special cases.
x??

---

#### Domino Covering Proof
Background context: This section introduces a method to prove that certain arrangements of dominoes on an 8×8 chessboard cannot form a perfect cover, by considering the placement process step-by-step. The proof relies on the fact that each domino covers exactly one black and one white square.

:p How does the proof demonstrate that placing dominoes on an 8×8 chessboard can lead to an impossibility of perfect covering?
??x
The proof shows that after placing the first 30 dominoes, there will be only two black squares left. Since each domino must cover one black and one white square, it is impossible to place the last domino because there are no matching white squares available.

```java
public class DominoCovering {
    public static boolean canPerfectlyCoverBoard(int m, int n) {
        // Check if both dimensions are even
        if ((m % 2 == 0 && n % 2 == 0)) {
            return true;
        }
        // Additional checks for specific conditions (not shown here)
        return false;
    }
}
```
x??

#### Propositions and Questions
Background context: The text discusses the importance of asking interesting questions in mathematics, beyond just solving existing problems. It mentions some specific questions related to dominoes covering an 8×8 chessboard.

:p Can you suggest a question that can be asked about removing squares from a chessboard?
??x
For example, if you remove two squares of different colors from an 8×8 chessboard, must the result have a perfect cover?

```java
public class ChessboardQuestions {
    public static boolean canCoverAfterRemoval(int m, int n, int[] removedSquares) {
        // Check the color of the removed squares and their positions
        // Logic to determine if a perfect cover is possible
        return false; // Placeholder logic
    }
}
```
x??

#### Perfect Cover on Chessboard
Background context: This section explores whether an 8×8 chessboard can have a perfect cover by 2×1 dominoes after removing certain squares. It highlights the importance of considering different scenarios to understand mathematical concepts.

:p If you remove two black and two white squares from an 8×8 chessboard, must the remaining board still have a perfect cover?
??x
The removal of two black and two white squares could potentially leave the board with a configuration that allows for a perfect cover. However, it depends on their positions and how they disrupt the balance between black and white squares.

```java
public class PerfectCoverQuestion2 {
    public static boolean canPerfectlyCoverBoardWithRemoval(int m, int n, int[] removedSquares) {
        // Count the number of remaining black and white squares after removal
        // Logic to determine if a perfect cover is possible
        return true; // Placeholder logic
    }
}
```
x??

#### Generalizing Questions
Background context: The text encourages thinking about questions that can be asked beyond the specific examples given, such as considering different board sizes or shapes for dominoes. It also hints at exploring higher-dimensional problems.

:p Can you formulate a question asking whether an m×n chessboard has a perfect cover with 2×1 dominoes?
??x
For every $m $ and$n $, does there exist a perfect cover of the$ m \times n $chessboard by 2×1 dominoes? If not, for which$ m $and$ n$ is there a perfect cover?

```java
public class GeneralizationQuestion {
    public static boolean canPerfectlyCoverGeneralBoard(int m, int n) {
        // Check if both dimensions are even or the product of m and n divided by 2 results in an integer
        return (m % 2 == 0 && n % 2 == 0) || ((m * n) / 2) % 1 == 0;
    }
}
```

Each flashcard is designed to cover a key concept from the provided text, encouraging familiarity with the ideas and questions posed.

#### Theorem, Proposition, Lemma, and Corollary
Background context: In mathematics, results are categorized into different types based on their importance and usage. A theorem is a significant result that has been proved. A proposition is less important than a theorem but still has been proved. A lemma is used as a stepping stone to prove theorems or propositions. A corollary follows quickly from a theorem or proposition and often represents a special case of it.
:p What is the difference between a theorem, proposition, lemma, and corollary?
??x
- **Theorem**: An important result that has been proved.
- **Proposition**: A less significant result than a theorem but still proven.
- **Lemma**: Typically a small result used as a stepping stone to prove propositions or theorems.
- **Corollary**: A result derived quickly from a proposition or theorem, often a special case of it.

For example:
```java
public class ProofExample {
    // Lemma: If a is even and b is odd, then a + b is odd.
    static boolean lemma() {
        int a = 2; // Even number
        int b = 3; // Odd number
        return (a + b) % 2 == 1; // True if the sum is odd
    }

    // Theorem: If a and b are both even, then their product ab is also even.
    static boolean theorem() {
        int a = 4; // Even number
        int b = 6; // Even number
        return (a * b) % 2 == 0; // True if the product is even
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Conjecture and Counterexample
Background context: A conjecture is a statement someone guesses to be true but cannot yet prove or disprove. It often comes from observing patterns in data. A counterexample disproves a conjecture by showing that it does not hold for some specific case.
:p What is the difference between a conjecture and a theorem?
??x
- **Conjecture**: A statement guessed to be true, but not yet proven or disproven.
- **Theorem**: A statement that has been rigorously proved.

For example:
```java
public class ConjectureExample {
    // Function to check if 2^n - 1 is a prime number for n = 6 (counterexample)
    static boolean isPrime(int n) {
        int num = (int) Math.pow(2, n) - 1;
        return isNumberPrime(num);
    }

    // Function to determine if the conjecture holds for n=6
    public static void checkConjecture() {
        System.out.println("Is 2^6 - 1 prime? " + isPrime(6)); // Counterexample: false
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Why Proofs are Important
Background context: Proofs ensure that mathematical results are based on solid reasoning and not just intuition or coincidence. They help us understand why a result is true, making mathematics both rigorous and enjoyable.
:p What does proving theorems in math do?
??x
Proving theorems ensures that mathematical results are based on solid reasoning rather than mere guesswork. Proofs provide insight into why something is true, adding depth to our understanding of mathematical concepts.

For example:
```java
public class ProofImportance {
    // Function to prove that 2^n - 1 is not prime for n=6 using a simple check
    static boolean proof() {
        int num = (int) Math.pow(2, 6) - 1; // 63
        return !isNumberPrime(num); // Check if the number is not prime
    }

    // Function to determine if 63 is prime (should be false)
    public static void prove() {
        System.out.println("Is 2^6 - 1 not a prime? " + proof()); // True, as 63 = 7 * 9
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Chessboard and Domino Tiling Example
Background context: An example of proving something through reasoning is the tiling problem with a chessboard. If you remove two opposite corners from an 8x8 chessboard, it's impossible to perfectly cover the remaining squares with dominoes because of color differences.
:p Why can't we tile the 6x6 chessboard (with two opposite corners removed) with 31 dominoes?
??x
The 6x6 chessboard has 32 white and 30 black or vice versa after removing two opposite corners. Since each domino covers one white and one black square, we need an equal number of both colors to cover the entire board perfectly. However, with 32-30 (or 30-32) difference in the count, it's impossible.

For example:
```java
public class ChessTiling {
    // Function to check if tiling is possible by counting colors
    static boolean canTile(int size, int removedSquares) {
        int totalSquares = size * size;
        int whiteSquares = (totalSquares + 1) / 2; // Half of the squares are white
        int blackSquares = totalSquares - whiteSquares; // The rest are black

        if (removedSquares > whiteSquares || removedSquares > blackSquares) {
            return false;
        }
        return true;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Can we tile an 8x8 board with two opposite corners removed? " + canTile(8, 2)); // False
    }
}
```

    }
}
```

#### The Pigeonhole Principle
Background context: The pigeonhole principle is a simple but powerful counting argument used to prove that certain conditions must be met. It states that if you have more pigeons than pigeonholes and each pigeon must reside in one of the holes, then at least one hole will contain multiple pigeons. Mathematically, if $n $ pigeonholes can hold at most$k $ pigeons each, and there are at least$ kn+1 $ pigeons, then at least one pigeonhole contains at least $k+1$ pigeons.

This principle works for any objects (not just pigeons) placed into containers. In the context of this proof, people in Sacramento, CA, are considered "pigeons," and their number of hairs on their head are the "pigeonholes."

:p What is the pigeonhole principle?
??x
The pigeonhole principle states that if $n $ items are put into$m $ containers, with$n > m$, then at least one container must contain more than one item. In this case, people (pigeons) in Sacramento are distributed based on their number of hairs (pigeonholes).
x??

---
#### Number of People and Hairs
Background context: The proof involves counting the number of non-balding people in Sacramento, CA, who have between 50,000 to 199,999 hairs. We use real-world data to make an estimate: there are approximately 480,000 people in Sacramento and at most 100,000 of them are balding.

:p How many non-balding people are estimated to be in Sacramento?
??x
Based on the given data, we can estimate that there are at least $480,000 - 100,000 = 380,000$ non-balding people.
x??

---
#### Pigeonholes and Hairs on Heads
Background context: To apply the pigeonhole principle to this problem, we define each possible number of hairs as a "pigeonhole." Specifically, from 50,000 to 199,999 hairs are considered, making a total of $199,999 - 50,000 + 1 = 150,000$ pigeonholes.

:p How many "pigeonholes" (boxes) are created for the number of hairs?
??x
We create 150,000 boxes, each labeled with a different number of hairs from 50,000 to 199,999.
x??

---
#### Application of Pigeonhole Principle
Background context: With at least 380,000 non-balding people and 150,000 pigeonholes (boxes for different numbers of hairs), we can use the pigeonhole principle to show that there must be some overlap in the number of hairs among these people.

:p Using the pigeonhole principle, how do you prove that at least three non-balding people have exactly the same number of hairs?
??x
By applying the pigeonhole principle: If 380,000 or more non-balding people are placed into 150,000 pigeonholes (representing different numbers of hairs), and since $380,000 > 150,000 \times 2 + 1$, at least one pigeonhole must contain at least three people with the same number of hairs.
x??

---
#### Detailed Pigeonhole Application
Background context: To further illustrate this, let's break down how the principle is applied. We know there are at least 380,000 non-balding people and each can have between 50,000 to 199,999 hairs (150,000 pigeonholes). By the pigeonhole principle, if we place these people into the boxes corresponding to their hair count, at least one box must contain three or more people.

:p How does the pigeonhole principle ensure that there are at least three non-balding people with the same number of hairs?
??x
The pigeonhole principle ensures this by noting that since 380,000 is greater than $150,000 \times 2 + 1$, at least one box (pigeonhole) must contain at least three people with the same number of hairs. This is because if each box had at most two people, we would need fewer than 380,000 people to fill all boxes, but we have more.
x??

---

#### The Pigeonhole Principle - Simple Form
The pigeonhole principle is a fundamental concept in discrete mathematics that deals with the distribution of items into containers. If you have more items than containers, at least one container must contain more than one item. In formal terms, if $n+1 $ objects are placed into$n$ boxes, then at least one box has at least two objects in it.

:p What does the simple form of the pigeonhole principle state?
??x
The simple form states that if you have $n+1 $ objects and only$n$ boxes, at least one box must contain at least two objects.
x??

---

#### The Pigeonhole Principle - General Form
The general form of the pigeonhole principle extends the basic idea to more complex scenarios. It says that if you have $kn+1 $ objects distributed into$n $ boxes, then at least one box will contain at least$k+1$ objects.

:p What does the general form of the pigeonhole principle state?
??x
The general form states that if you have $kn+1 $ objects and distribute them into$n $ boxes, then at least one box will contain at least$k+1$ objects.
x??

---

#### Application to Real-World Scenarios - Hair Count Example
The pigeonhole principle can be applied to real-world scenarios. For example, if there are 380,000 non-balding Sacramentans and you have only 150,000 boxes (each representing a unique number of hairs on the head), by the pigeonhole principle, at least one box must contain more than two names.

:p How many people are there in the scenario?
??x
There are 380,000 non-balding Sacramentans.
x??

---

#### Application to Real-World Scenarios - Playing Cards Example
Another example of the pigeonhole principle is with playing cards. If you have 5 playing cards, at least two of them must belong to the same suit (there are only 4 suits).

:p How many cards need to be drawn to guarantee that at least two are of the same suit?
??x
To guarantee that at least two cards are of the same suit, you need to draw 5 cards.
x??

---

#### Application to Real-World Scenarios - Birth Months Example
The pigeonhole principle can also be applied to people's birth months. If there are 37 people, then by the pigeonhole principle, at least 4 must share the same birth month (since there are only 12 months).

:p How many people need to be in a group to guarantee that at least 4 share the same birth month?
??x
To guarantee that at least 4 people share the same birth month, you need 37 people.
x??

---

#### Application to Real-World Scenarios - Birthday Problem Example
The birthday problem is another interesting application of the pigeonhole principle. It asks how many people are needed to have a 50% chance that two of them share the same birthday. The answer might be surprising, but you only need 23 people for this probability.

:p How many people do you need to have a 50 percent chance that at least two people share the same birthday?
??x
You only need 23 people to have a 51% chance that at least two of them share the same birthday.
x??

---
Each flashcard focuses on different aspects of the pigeonhole principle, providing clear explanations and examples for better understanding.

#### Pigeonhole Principle - Socks Example
Background context: The pigeonhole principle states that if you have more items than containers, at least one container must contain more than one item. In this example, we are dealing with socks where each pair has a unique color.

:p How many socks must be pulled out to guarantee a matching pair?
??x
By the pigeonhole principle, if you pull out $n + 1 $ socks, you will have at least one pair because there are only$n $ different colors (pairs). If you pull out just$n$ socks, it is possible that each sock could be from a different color.

```java
// Pseudocode to illustrate the logic
public class SockPulling {
    public static int minSocksNeeded(int pairs) {
        return pairs + 1; // n+1 socks needed to guarantee at least one pair
    }
}
```

#### Pigeonhole Principle - US Residents Example
Background context: The pigeonhole principle can be used to determine that in a set of $k $ items distributed among$n $ containers, if the number of items exceeds the product of$(n-1)k + 1 $, at least one container must contain more than$ k$ items. Here, we are determining how many people share the same birthday.

:p How many U.S. residents are guaranteed to have the same birthday?
??x
Using the pigeonhole principle, if you distribute 330 million people across 366 days of the year, at least one day will have more than $\left\lceil \frac{330,000,000}{366} \right\rceil = 901,640$ people born on it.

```java
// Pseudocode to calculate the minimum number of people with the same birthday
public class BirthdayCalculation {
    public static int minPeopleWithSameBirthday(int totalPeople, int daysInYear) {
        return (int) Math.ceil((double) totalPeople / daysInYear); // Calculate the minimum number
    }
}

#### Pigeonhole Principle - General Form
Background context: The general form of the pigeonhole principle states that if $k \cdot n + 1 $ items are distributed among$n $ containers, at least one container must contain more than$ k $ items. This is a formal way to express the principle where $k$ is the number of items per container before needing an additional item.

:p How does the general form of the pigeonhole principle work?
??x
The general form of the pigeonhole principle states that if you have $k \cdot n + 1 $ items and$n $ containers, at least one container must contain more than$ k $ items. This is because distributing $ k \cdot n $ items would fill each container with exactly $ k $ items, but the additional item (the $(k \cdot n + 1)^{th}$) forces one of the containers to have at least $ k + 1$ items.

```java
// Pseudocode to illustrate the general form
public class GeneralPigeonhole {
    public static int minItemsPerContainer(int totalItems, int numContainers) {
        return (int) Math.ceil((double) totalItems / numContainers); // Calculate minimum items per container
    }
}
```

#### Pigeonhole Principle Introduction
Background context: The pigeonhole principle is a fundamental concept in combinatorics and discrete mathematics. It states that if $n $ items are put into$m $ containers, with$n > m$, then at least one container must contain more than one item.

In the given text, the author discusses how to identify suitable "boxes" (containers) and "objects" for applying the pigeonhole principle. This example uses birthdays as objects and days of the year as boxes.
:p How can we apply the pigeonhole principle to ensure that 901,640 people have the same birthday in the U.S.?
??x
To apply the pigeonhole principle here, we consider the number of possible birthdays (365 or 366 for leap years) as our "boxes" and the number of people (901,640) as our "objects."

Given:
- Number of days in a year = 366
- Required number of people to ensure same birthday = 901,640

We calculate the minimum number of people required using:
$$\text{Minimum People} = (365 \times k) + 1$$where $ k$ is an integer.

For:
$$365k + 1 > 901,640$$

Solving for $k$:
$$k = \left\lceil \frac{901,640 - 1}{365} \right\rceil$$
$$k = \left\lceil 2478.15 \right\rceil = 2479$$

Thus:
$$(365 \times 2479) + 1 = 901,641$$

Therefore, to guarantee that 901,640 people all have the same birthday, we need at least 901,641 people.

#### Identifying Pigeonholes and Objects
Background context: In applying the pigeonhole principle, it is crucial to correctly identify what should be considered as "pigeons" (objects) and "pigeonholes" (containers). The example given involves identifying pairs of numbers from a set that sum up to 9.
:p How do we identify the objects and boxes in Proposition 1.9?
??x
In Proposition 1.9, the task is to prove that given any five numbers chosen from the set $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}$, two of them will add up to 9.

Here:
- Objects: The five chosen numbers.
- Pigeonholes: The pairs that sum to 9. These are (1, 8), (2, 7), (3, 6), and (4, 5).

By placing the numbers into these four pairs (pigeonholes) and selecting five objects (numbers), we apply the pigeonhole principle.

#### Scratch Work for Proposition Proofs
Background context: Scratch work is a crucial part of proof writing. It involves testing hypotheses and trying out ideas to gain insight before formulating an actual proof.

Example from the text:
- Testing with specific numbers like 1, 3, 5, 6, 7 (which yields 3 + 6 = 9) or 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 (which yields 2 + 7 = 9).
:p Why is scratch work important in proving mathematical propositions?
??x
Scratch work helps in:
- Testing hypotheses and ideas.
- Gaining intuition about the problem.
- Finding counterexamples if a hypothesis fails.

For Proposition 1.9, testing with different sets of five numbers from $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}$ confirms that at least two numbers will always sum to 9.

#### Application of Pigeonhole Principle in Number Theory
Background context: The pigeonhole principle can be used in number theory and combinatorics to solve problems involving sets and their subsets.

Example from the text:
- Finding pairs of numbers that add up to a specific value (e.g., 9).
:p How does the pigeonhole principle help identify pairs of numbers that sum to 9?
??x
The pigeonhole principle helps by dividing the set into groups where each group contains pairs that sum to 9. For $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}$, these pairs are (1, 8), (2, 7), (3, 6), and (4, 5).

Since there are four such pairs (pigeonholes) and five numbers (objects) to place in them, by the pigeonhole principle, at least one pair must contain two of the chosen numbers.

#### Box and Number Pairing
Background context explaining how numbers are paired into boxes, each box containing a pair of numbers that add up to 9. The pairs are (1,8), (2,7), (3,6), and (4,5).

:p What is the pairing scheme used for the problem?
??x
The numbers are paired as follows: 
- Box 1 corresponds to (1, 8)
- Box 2 corresponds to (2, 7)
- Box 3 corresponds to (3, 6)
- Box 4 corresponds to (4, 5)

Each pair adds up to 9.

#### Pigeonhole Principle Application
Background context on the pigeonhole principle and its simple form. The problem states that by placing five numbers into four boxes, at least one box must contain two numbers.

:p How does the pigeonhole principle apply in this scenario?
??x
By the pigeonhole principle (Principle 1.5), if you place 5 numbers into 4 boxes, there must be at least one box containing more than one number. Since each pair of numbers adds up to 9, having two numbers in a single box means their sum is 9.

#### Divide the Square
Background context on dividing a 3×3 square into smaller squares (boxes) to apply the pigeonhole principle.

:p How can you divide the 3×3 square to use the pigeonhole principle?
??x
Divide the 3×3 square into 9 smaller boxes, each of size 1×1. This creates 9 boxes in total.
```
+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |
+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |
+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |
+---+---+---+
```

By placing 10 points into these 9 boxes, at least one box will contain more than one point.

#### Distance Calculation
Background context on calculating the maximum distance between two points in a 1×1 square using the Pythagorean theorem.

:p What is the maximum possible distance between two points in a 1×1 square?
??x
The maximum distance between two points in a 1×1 square can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. For opposite corners, the distance $d$ is given by:
$$d = \sqrt{(1-0)^2 + (1-0)^2} = \sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{2}$$

Therefore, the maximum possible distance between two points in a 1×1 square is $\sqrt{2}$.
x??

#### Proof Construction
Background context on constructing a proof for the pigeonhole principle application to the square.

:p How does the proof construct the scenario and apply the pigeonhole principle?
??x
The 3×3 square is divided into 9 smaller 1×1 squares (boxes). By placing 10 points in these 9 boxes, at least one box must contain at least two points by the pigeonhole principle. These two points are within a 1×1 square and thus their maximum distance apart is $\sqrt{2}$.

```java
// Pseudocode to illustrate the placement of points into boxes
public void placePoints() {
    int[][] grid = new int[3][3]; // 3x3 grid representing the 9 boxes
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { // Place 10 points in the grid
        // Code to randomly place a point into one of the 9 boxes
    }
}
```

By the pigeonhole principle, at least two points will share a box. The maximum distance between any two points within a single 1×1 square is $\sqrt{2}$.

#### Divisibility and Pigeonhole Principle
Background context: The text presents a mathematical proposition stating that among any 101 integers chosen from the set {1, 2, ..., 200}, at least one number will divide another.

#### Prime Numbers and Box Pairs
In this problem, we are tasked with selecting 100 boxes to place numbers from 1 to 200 such that any two chosen numbers in the same box have a divisibility relationship. The initial attempt involved pairing prime numbers larger than 100 with other numbers, but this approach became overly complex.
:p How can we solve this problem by considering even and odd numbers?
??x
We can divide the numbers from 1 to 200 into two categories: even and odd. For each odd number $m $, we create a box that contains all numbers of the form $2^k \cdot m $ where$k$ is a non-negative integer. This ensures that any two numbers in the same box have a smaller number that divides the larger one.
??x
```java
// Pseudocode to illustrate the concept
function createBoxes() {
    boxes = new HashMap<Integer, List<Integer>>()
    for (oddNumber from 1 to 199 with step 2) { // Considering only odd numbers
        box = []
        currentNum = oddNumber
        while (currentNum <= 200) {
            add currentNum to box
            currentNum *= 2
        }
        boxes.put(oddNumber, box)
    }
    return boxes
}
```
x??

#### Prime Numbers Greater than 100
The prime numbers larger than 100 do not divide any number in the set {1, 2, ..., 200} other than themselves. This means each such prime must be placed in its own box to ensure that no two numbers within a single box share a divisibility relationship.
:p How can we handle primes greater than 100?
??x
Primes larger than 100 should have their own separate boxes because none of them divide any number between 1 and 200, except themselves. Since these primes are odd, they won't interfere with the pairing strategy for other numbers.
??x

---

#### Divisibility Pairs for Even Numbers
For even numbers in the range {1, 2, ..., 200}, we can pair them with their multiples by powers of 2. For example, if $m $ is an odd number less than or equal to 100, then$2^k \cdot m $ for various non-negative integers$k$ will be placed in the same box.
:p How do we place even numbers into boxes?
??x
Even numbers can be paired with their multiples by powers of 2. For instance, if you have a number like 10 (which is $2^1 \cdot 5 $), it would go in the same box as 20 (which is $2^2 \cdot 5 $) and 40 (which is $2^3 \cdot 5$). This ensures that any two numbers in the same box will have a smaller number dividing the larger one.
??x
```java
// Pseudocode to illustrate the concept for even numbers
function placeEvenNumbersInBoxes() {
    boxes = new HashMap<Integer, List<Integer>>()
    for (oddNumber from 1 to 99 with step 2) { // Considering only odd numbers less than or equal to 99
        box = []
        currentNum = 2 * oddNumber
        while (currentNum <= 200) {
            add currentNum to box
            currentNum *= 2
        }
        boxes.put(oddNumber, box)
    }
    return boxes
}
```
x??

#### Handling Numbers Greater than 100
Numbers greater than 100 that are not prime and do not have a divisibility relationship with any number between 1 and 100 can be paired in such a way that each pair (or larger group) shares a common factor.
:p How do we handle numbers like 12?
??x
A number like 12, which is $3 \times 4$, can go in the box with 6 and 3 because they are all multiples of 3. This ensures that any two numbers in the same box share a common factor.
??x

---

#### Smaller Test Cases
To validate our approach, we tested it on smaller sets. For example, choosing 7 out of 12 numbers from {1, 2, ..., 12} and placing each in an appropriate odd-numbered box verified that the solution works as expected.
:p What is a small test case used to verify the strategy?
??x
A small test case involves choosing 7 numbers from the set {1, 2, ..., 12}. By creating boxes for every odd number (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11) and placing multiples of these odds in their respective boxes, we can verify that any two chosen numbers will have a smaller one dividing the larger one.
??x
```java
// Pseudocode to illustrate the small test case
function testWithSmallerSet() {
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
    boxes = createBoxes()
    for (num from numbers) {
        add num to appropriate box in boxes
    }
    // Check that each pair of chosen numbers has a smaller one dividing the larger one
}
```
