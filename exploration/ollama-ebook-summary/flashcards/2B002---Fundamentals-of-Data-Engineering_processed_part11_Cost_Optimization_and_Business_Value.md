#### Total Opportunity Cost of Ownership (TOCO)
Total opportunity cost of ownership refers to the value lost by choosing one option over others. It encompasses the benefits foregone from not choosing alternative technologies, architectures, or processes.

:p What is TOCO in the context of data engineering?
??x
TOCO in data engineering refers to the value lost by committing to a specific technology stack that excludes other potentially better options. Engineers must consider what they are giving up when selecting one path over another.
