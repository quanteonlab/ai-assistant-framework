**Starting Chapter:** Letting the Parties Determine the Remedies for Breach

---

---
#### Restitution for Breach of Contract
In cases where a party breaches a contract and stops performing, restitution is awarded to compensate the non-breaching party. The amount of restitution depends on Turner’s expectancy of receiving the full value of the contract minus any expenses incurred by the breaching party.
:p How does the court determine the amount of restitution in a breach of contract?
??x
The court calculates restitution based on Turner's expectancy, ensuring that the non-breaching party receives no more than what would have been reasonably expected. For example, if Turner had to pay $30 to complete the job and agreed to receive $120, Britton should not receive more than $90 as restitution. If Turner completed 9.5/12 of the work worth $120 at a cost of $20 per unit, then the pro-rata portion would be (9.5 ÷ 12) ×$120 =$95.

#### Rewriting Contracts Through Reformation
Reformation is used to correct mistakes made while drafting a contract, such as scrivener's errors. This process involves rewriting the contract to reflect the true intentions of the parties if there was a mistake in transcribing their agreement.
:p What is reformation in the context of contracts?
??x
Reformation involves altering a written contract to better match what the parties originally agreed upon. It is typically used when one party made an error while drafting the document, leading to terms that differ from the actual intent of both parties. The goal is to align the writing with the mutual understanding.

#### Contracting Around Default Rules
Parties have the freedom to modify or waive certain default rules set by contract law through specific provisions in their agreement. This includes setting liquidated damages and limiting available remedies.
:p How can parties adjust the default rules of contract law?
??x
Parties can tailor their contracts by including clauses for liquidated damages, which are predetermined amounts agreed upon before any breach occurs. They can also limit the types of remedies that would otherwise be available in case of a breach. This flexibility allows both parties to better manage potential risks and outcomes.
x??

---
#### Liquidated Damages
Liquidated damages are pre-determined compensation set by agreement for breaches of contract. Courts typically allow such provisions if they meet specific criteria, like difficulty in foreseeing actual damages.
:p What are liquidated damages?
??x
Liquidated damages are stipulated sums agreed upon by parties before a breach occurs to cover potential losses in the event of non-performance. They aim to simplify damage calculations and provide clear guidance on compensation. Courts often validate such clauses if they meet certain tests: difficulties in foreseeing actual damages, being reasonable under the circumstances, or covering only foreseeable losses.
x??

---
#### Examples of Liquidated Damages
To illustrate how liquidated damages are calculated, consider a contract where parties agree to pay $500 for late delivery. If one party breaches and is late by 30 days, they would be required to pay this agreed sum rather than trying to calculate actual losses.
:p How does the court determine if pre-determined damage amounts (liquidated damages) are valid?
??x
Courts validate liquidated damages under certain conditions: 
- They must be difficult to foresee and calculate.
- They should not be excessive compared to potential actual damages.
- They can only cover foreseeable losses.

For instance, in a contract for the sale of goods, where calculating actual damages is straightforward, courts are more likely to accept pre-agreed damage amounts. However, if such provisions are found to be punitive or grossly disproportionate, they may be struck down.

#### Foreseeable Losses and Liquidated Damages in Construction Contracts
Background context: In construction contracts, unforeseen delays can result in significant losses for all parties involved. These losses may include delays affecting subcontractors, tenants, and the owner's ability to secure additional financing. Liquidated damages are a predetermined sum agreed upon by both parties to cover potential losses if a breach occurs.
:p What is the role of liquidated damages in construction contracts?
??x
Liquidated damages serve as a pre-agreed compensation for specific breaches that may lead to foreseeable losses, such as delays. They help mitigate uncertainties and provide a clear financial remedy without the need for complex damage calculations after an actual breach.
??x

---

#### Calculation of Liquidated Damages
Background context: Calculating liquidated damages reasonably is crucial to avoid penalties being seen as punitive by courts. The goal is to ensure that damages are fair and not excessive compared to the actual harm caused.
:p How should parties calculate reasonable liquidated damages?
??x
Parties should consider calculating liquidated damages on a per diem basis rather than using a lump sum, especially for large projects. This approach helps reflect the true extent of potential losses over time, making the damages more proportional and less likely to be seen as punitive.
```java
public class DamageCalculation {
    public double calculatePerDiemDamage(double dailyRate, int days) {
        return dailyRate * days;
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Hindsight Rule in Liquidated Damages
Background context: The hindsight rule disallows liquidated damages if the actual losses are minimal or non-existent, even if the agreement was fair at the time of signing. This rule aims to prevent courts from enforcing agreements that seem excessively punitive.
:p What is the hindsight rule and how does it affect liquidated damages?
??x
The hindsight rule states that liquidated damages cannot exceed the actual damages suffered after a breach. If the actual damages are minimal or non-existent, the court may refuse to enforce the liquidated damages clause, awarding actual damages instead.
??x

---

#### Precedent and Consumer Contracts
Background context: Liquidated damages clauses must be reasonable and not overly punitive. Courts scrutinize such agreements more closely when one party has little bargaining power, as in consumer contracts.
:p How do courts view liquidated damages in consumer contracts?
??x
Courts carefully examine liquidated damages clauses, especially in consumer contracts where the non-breaching party may have limited bargaining power. Such clauses are scrutinized to ensure they compensate rather than penalize the breaching party.
??x

---

#### Down Payments and Liquidated Damages
Background context: Down payments or deposits made before a purchase are generally not considered liquidated damages unless explicitly stated in the contract. This distinction is important for clarity on what constitutes liquidated damages.
:p How do courts differentiate between down payments and liquidated damages?
??x
Down payments or deposits are typically not considered liquidated damages because they were not agreed upon as compensation for a breach at the time of the agreement. To make them liquidated damages, parties must expressly agree that the down payment is forfeited if the buyer breaches.
```java
public class PaymentAgreement {
    public boolean isLiquidatedDamage(double deposit, String agreement) {
        return agreement.contains("deposit forfeiture on breach");
    }
}
```

#### Liquidated Damages Without Actual Losses
Background context: In cases where a breach results in no actual damages, the issue arises of whether to recover liquidated damages. Courts have different views on this.
:p What happens when a breach results in no actual losses but there is a pre-agreed liquidated damage clause?
??x
In such situations, courts may consider three approaches:
1. The economist’s view: Supports recovery even if no actual loss occurred.
2. The hindsight rule: Refuses to enforce the clause if actual damages are minimal or non-existent.
3. The middle road: Allows the damages unless they are unconscionably disproportionate.

The choice of approach depends on the specific circumstances and jurisdiction.
??x

#### Liquidated Damages Provision
Background context: In 1979, C&H Sugar contracted with Sun Ship to build a sugar ship for $25 million. The agreement included a liquidated damages provision of$17,000 per day if delivered late. This provision was intended to ensure that both parties agreed on the amount of damages in advance and avoid uncertainty.

The first test for enforcement is whether the party suffering the loss can prove actual damages. The second test is whether the parties were sophisticated enough to reasonably predict the probable extent of their losses.
:p What is a liquidated damages provision, and what tests must be met for it to be enforced?
??x
A liquidated damages provision is an agreement between two parties that specifies in advance the amount of damages if one party breaches the contract. For enforcement, the provision must meet two tests: (1) The party suffering the loss can prove actual damages; and (2) the parties were sophisticated enough to reasonably predict the probable extent of their losses.
x??

---

#### Damages Proportionality
Background context: Sun Ship delivered the ship nine months late, causing C&H Sugar to demand $4.4 million in liquidated damages. However, due to the availability of other ships, C&H Sugar only suffered$368,000 in actual losses.
:p Why did the court refuse to apply the hindsight rule despite the large difference between the liquidated damages and the actual damages?
??x
The court refused to apply the hindsight rule because the parties had agreed on a formula for determining the liquidated damages, which satisfied both tests of reasonableness and sophistication. The court determined that it was not their role to second-guess the agreement.

#### Repair and Replace Remedy
Background context: Manufacturers often limit remedies for breach of warranty to repair or replacement. However, this can sometimes lead to issues if repeated repairs fail to resolve the problem.
:p What happens when a repair remedy fails of its essential purpose?
??x
When a repair remedy fails of its essential purpose, meaning the buyer does not get what they reasonably expected (goods that work properly), they may seek other remedies under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) § 2-719(2). Specifically, this can lead to revocation of acceptance, allowing the buyer to return the goods and get their money back.
x??

---

#### Consequential Damages
Background context: Sellers often limit the amount of consequential damages that a buyer can recover. The UCC provides specific rules for this, stating that buyers can only recover losses set in motion by a breach.
:p How do sellers commonly limit the recovery of consequential damages?
??x
Sellers typically include clauses in contracts to limit the recovery of consequential damages. For instance, under the UCC § 2-719(3), sellers can specify limited remedies and exclude or limit the amount of consequential damages that a buyer can recover.
x??

---

#### Lemon Laws
Background context: Lemon laws are designed to protect consumers who purchase defective products by allowing them to return the goods after multiple attempts at repair. In this case, lemon laws could apply if the ship's defects were significant enough and repairs continued for an unreasonable time.
:p What is a lemon law, and in what scenario might it be applicable?
??x
A lemon law is designed to protect consumers who purchase defective products by allowing them to return the goods after multiple attempts at repair. In the context of the sugar ship, if repeated attempts to fix defects were unsuccessful over an unreasonable period, C&H Sugar could potentially invoke a lemon law to seek remedies such as replacement or refund.
x??

#### Limitation of Consequential Damages for Consumer Goods
Background context: The text discusses limitations on consequential damages, especially in consumer goods transactions. While parties have the freedom to limit such damages through contract terms, sellers cannot limit liability for personal injury involving consumer goods.

:p What is a limitation placed on sellers regarding consumer goods in terms of liability?
??x
A seller in a transaction involving consumer goods cannot limit their liability for personal injury.
x??

---

#### Consequential Damages and Software Transactions
Background context: The text explains that while parties have freedom to limit consequential damages, this is subject to certain exceptions. It uses the example of software transactions where the rule is applied by analogy due to the similar nature of warranty provisions.

:p How does a court typically handle the limitations on breach remedies in software contracts?
??x
When a limited remedy fails of its essential purpose, courts may strike both the limited remedy and the consequential damages exclusion. However, different jurisdictions take varying approaches: some strike both provisions, while others only strike the limited remedy if they appear in separate paragraphs.
x??

---

#### Enforcement of Limitations on Consequential Damages
Background context: The text explains that limitations on consequential damages are generally enforceable, unless the limitation or exclusion is unconscionable. For consumer goods, these exclusions are prima facie unconscionable.

:p What is the general stance of courts regarding limitations on consequential damages?
??x
Courts generally enforce limitations on consequential damages unless they find such limitations to be unconscionable. In consumer goods transactions, limitations for personal injury are considered prima facie unconscionable.
x??

---

#### Court's Approach to Striking Provisions
Background context: The text outlines three different approaches that jurisdictions take when a court finds the limited remedy fails of its essential purpose. These include striking both provisions, only the limited remedy, or applying an arbitrary approach based on paragraph separation.

:p What are the three common approaches courts may take if they find the limited remedy fails?
??x
1. Strike both the limited remedy and the consequential damages exclusion.
2. Only strike the limited remedy.
3. Strike both provisions if included in the same paragraph but only the limited remedy if they appear in separate paragraphs (the arbitrary approach).
x??

---

#### Getting Attorney’s Fees from Defendants
Background context: The text explains that under the American Rule, each side pays its own attorney's fees. However, this can be modified by contract terms, and some statutes may require reciprocal provisions.

:p What is the general rule regarding attorney’s fees in U.S. law?
??x
The general rule in U.S. law is that each side pays its own attorney's fees (the American Rule), but parties can contract around this to include one-sided fee-shifting clauses, which are generally considered unfair and may be read as reciprocal by statute or case law.
x??

---

#### Recovering Transaction Costs
Background context: The text discusses the recovery of transaction costs, including litigation expenses like attorney’s fees. Civil procedure statutes typically allow recovery of only limited expenses such as filing fees and deposition costs.

:p Can a plaintiff recover costs from the defendant in a contract claim?
??x
Yes, a plaintiff can sometimes recover some transaction costs, such as attorney's fees, from the defendant. This is more likely under certain statutes that provide for fee-shifting to plaintiffs who bring claims, especially in consumer protection cases.
x??

#### Contract Remedies and Punitive Damages
Background context: This section discusses the principles of contract law, particularly focusing on punitive damages and how they are rarely awarded in contract cases. It also covers the rationale behind allowing breach when it is efficient and how courts may award punitive damages under specific circumstances such as bad-faith insurance claims or where there is a special relationship between parties.

:p What is the rationale for not discouraging breaches of contract through punitive damages?
??x
Punitive damages are generally not awarded in contract cases because such damages would discourage efficient allocation of goods and services. Contract law focuses on compensating for legal wrongs, which can often be fixed with money compensation rather than punishment.

For example, an employee leaving a job to take a better position should not face the risk of excessive punitive damages that could deter them from seeking more beneficial employment.
x??

#### Choice-of-Law Clauses
Background context: This section explains how parties may choose which set of rules govern their contract through choice-of-law clauses. It differentiates between the old rule and the modern rule, with examples provided to illustrate each.

:p How does the old rule determine the applicable law in a contract dispute?
??x
Under the old rule, the law that applies is determined by the last act that resulted in contract formation. Typically, this is the acceptance of the offer. If one party signs in Ohio and another in Indiana, the second signature signifies acceptance, making Indiana's law governing.

For instance, if a business in Ohio adds language stating approval from its home office in Nebraska is required for a contract to form, then the contract is formed in Nebraska, leading to Nebraska law applying.
x??

---
#### Choice-of-Forum Clauses
Background context: This section covers how parties can require that a suit be brought in a particular court through choice-of-forum clauses. It provides an example from the U.S. Supreme Court case involving Carnival Cruise Lines.

:p What is the significance of a choice-of-forum clause in contract disputes?
??x
A choice-of-forum clause allows one party to designate the court where any legal dispute arising out of the contract will be litigated. This can provide convenience and potentially give a home-field advantage. For instance, a ship owner might include such a clause to ensure cases are heard in their state.

Example: In Carnival Cruise Lines v. Shute, Mrs. Shute sued Carnival for injuries sustained at sea. Despite agreeing to a choice-of-forum clause directing suits to be filed in Connecticut (Subway’s headquarters), the Montana court refused to apply that law due to its policies on arbitration clauses and instead applied Montana's laws.
x??

---
#### The Role of Federal Courts
Background context: This section explains how federal courts determine which state’s law applies when dealing with cases based on diversity of citizenship, as there is no federal contract law.

:p How do federal courts decide the applicable state law in a contract dispute?
??x
Federal courts use rules of civil procedure to determine where a case should be litigated. If they are required to apply laws other than their own (the forum), lawyers must provide information about the relevant laws from the jurisdiction whose law is being applied.

For example, if a federal court needs to decide on California law for a contract dispute but the case is filed in Montana, the court would require detailed information about California’s laws related to the contract.
x??

---
#### Contract Formation and Choice of Law
Background context: This section describes how the location where the last act forming a contract occurs can determine which state's law applies. It also explains how parties might manipulate this rule.

:p What can parties do to influence the choice-of-law in their contracts?
??x
Parties can manipulate the choice-of-law rules by including clauses that specify where and under what conditions a contract is formed. For example, adding language like "no contract is formed unless approved by our home office" shifts the formation of the contract to the location of the headquarters.

Example: If a business in Ohio states that approval from its Nebraska home office is required for a contract to form, this would make Nebraska law applicable instead of Ohio's.
x??

---
#### Summary of Key Points
Background context: This summary consolidates the key points discussed, including choice-of-law and choice-of-forum clauses.

:p What are the main takeaways about choosing laws and forums in contracts?
??x
The main takeaways include:
1. Parties can choose which set of rules govern their contract through choice-of-law clauses.
2. The old rule typically applies where the last act forming the contract occurs, while the modern rule looks at the jurisdiction with the most significant contacts to the transaction.
3. Choice-of-forum clauses allow parties to designate a specific court for dispute resolution, providing convenience and potentially a home-field advantage.

Parties must ensure their chosen laws and forums are reasonable and not offensive to the policies of the jurisdictions involved.
