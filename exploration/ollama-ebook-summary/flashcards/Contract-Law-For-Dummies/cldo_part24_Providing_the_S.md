**Starting Chapter:** Providing the Seller a Remedy When the Buyers in Breach

---

#### Buyer's Remedies Against Seller
Background context explaining the buyer's remedies when a seller breaches the contract. The expectancy rule states that the buyer is entitled to the benefit of the bargain, which includes obtaining the goods and paying the agreed price. If the seller fails to deliver or performs inadequately, the buyer can seek damages to restore their wealth to what it would have been had the contract been fully performed.

The formula for expectancy is: 
- Expected Wealth = (Value of Goods - Cost) + Damages

:p What are the key remedies a buyer has against a seller who breaches the contract?
??x
The key remedies include obtaining the contract price, resale, and using market value as damages. These remedies aim to restore the buyer's wealth to what it would have been had the contract been fully performed.

- **Obtaining Contract Price:** The buyer can seek the agreed-upon price for delivered goods.
- **Resale:** The seller can resell the goods to another buyer and recover the difference between the resale price and the contract price if there is a profit.
- **Market Value:** If resale isn't possible, the buyer can calculate damages based on the market value of the goods.

:p How does the expectancy rule work in this context?
??x
The expectancy rule states that the buyer should be restored to their original position as if the contract had been fully performed. This means the buyer is entitled to the benefit of the bargain, which includes the value of the goods and any additional damages incurred due to the breach.

For example, if a seller breaches by delivering goods worth $800,000 but the buyer was supposed to pay $750,000, the buyer can seek $750,000 as damages because that's what they would have had under the contract. The formula is:

- Expected Wealth = (Value of Goods - Cost) + Damages

:p What happens if a seller breaches and delivers goods to the buyer?
??x
If a seller breaches by delivering goods to the buyer, the buyer can seek the contract price as damages. This means the seller must pay the agreed-upon price for the delivered goods.

For instance, if the seller breached by delivering 100,000 bushels of wheat at $7.50 per bushel (totaling $750,000), but the market price later rose to $8.00 per bushel ($800,000), the buyer can still only recover the original contract price of$750,000.

:p Can a seller recover damages if they deliver goods and the buyer breaches?
??x
Yes, a seller who has delivered goods and the buyer breaches can seek the contract price as damages. The UCC § 2-709(1)(a) states that when the buyer fails to pay for accepted or conforming goods within a reasonable time after risk of loss passes to the buyer, the seller can recover the price.

The relevant excerpt from North Carolina's UCC is:
```plaintext
§ 25-2-709. Action for the price.
(1) When the buyer fails to pay the price as it becomes due the seller may recover, together with any incidental damages under the next section, the price (a) of goods accepted or of conforming goods lost or damaged within a commercially reasonable time after risk of their loss has passed to the buyer; and
(b) of goods identified to the contract if the seller is unable after reasonable effort to resell them at a reasonable price or the circumstances reasonably indicate that such effort will be unavailing.
```

:p What happens if a seller can't sell unusual goods after delivery?
??x
If a seller delivers unusual goods and the buyer breaches, the seller might not be able to resell the goods due to their unique nature. In this case, the seller can still recover the contract price because they have already fulfilled their side of the agreement.

For example, if a seller produces a neon sign saying "Eat at Joe’s" and the buyer refuses delivery, the seller has to make reasonable efforts to find another buyer. However, finding someone willing to buy such a specific sign might be difficult or impossible. Therefore, the seller can still recover the contract price of $2,000.

:p What is the UCC's stance on resale as a remedy?
??x
The UCC allows for resale as a remedy when the buyer breaches and the seller has delivered goods. If the seller can resell the goods at a higher price than the contract price, they may recover the difference between the resale price and the contract price.

For instance, if a seller sells a unique piece of art that was contracted to be sold for $500 but later sells it for $1,000 after the buyer breaches, the seller can recover the additional $500 as damages.

:p What is market value as a remedy in case of breach?
??x
Market value can be used as a remedy if resale isn't possible. The seller calculates the damages based on the current market price of the goods rather than trying to resell them.

For example, if a seller has delivered goods that are no longer salable at any reasonable price and the market value is significantly lower than the contract price, the seller can still recover the contract price as damages.

:p How does the UCC handle unusual goods with no market value?
??x
The UCC provides for the recovery of the contract price even if the seller cannot resell unusual goods. This is because the seller has already performed their part of the agreement and should be compensated according to the terms agreed upon.

For instance, if a seller produces a custom neon sign that the buyer refuses to accept, the seller must make reasonable efforts to find another buyer but may ultimately recover the contract price of $2,000 even if resale is unfeasible.

#### Resale Remedies under UCC § 2-706(1)
Background context: When a buyer breaches a contract to purchase goods, and the seller finds another buyer willing to purchase them at a lower price, the seller can sell the goods to the new buyer. The difference between this resale remedy and the cover remedy is that resale remedies do not include consequential damages.

Resale formula as found in UCC § 2-706(1): 
$$\text{Damages} = (\text{Contract Price}) - (\text{Resale Price}) + (\text{Incidental Damages}) - (\text{Expenses Saved by Breach})$$

Example: Suppose a buyer in Boston contracted to buy from a seller in Seattle 100,000 bushels of winter wheat at $7.50 per bushel. The buyer agreed to pay the shipping cost of $50,000. The buyer breaches. The seller finds a buyer in Minneapolis who will pay $7.00 per bushel but the seller has to pay shipping costs of$30,000 to get it there.

:p What is the resale formula as found in UCC § 2-706(1)?
??x
The resale formula calculates damages by subtracting the resale price and expenses saved from the contract price plus any incidental damages.
```java
public class ResaleCalculation {
    public double calculateResaleDamages(double contractPrice, double resalePrice, double incidentalDamages, double expensesSaved) {
        return (contractPrice - resalePrice + incidentalDamages - expensesSaved);
    }
}
```

#### No Consequential Damages in Resale Remedies
Background context: When a seller uses the resale remedy and sells goods to another party, they cannot recover consequential damages. The policy rationale behind this is that if the buyer doesn’t perform, the seller hasn't lost money from the sale.

:p Why can’t a seller recovering under resale remedies claim for consequential damages?
??x
Consequential damages are not allowed in resale remedies because when the buyer breaches, the seller hasn't lost any additional money related to the transaction. The policy behind this is that proving such losses would be difficult and potentially unfair.
x??

---

#### Mitigation of Losses after Breach
Background context: If goods are not ready for immediate resale at the time of breach, the seller must decide whether to continue manufacturing or stop. The goal is to mitigate loss as much as possible.

Example scenario: A county orders a bridge built. After construction begins, it breaches the contract saying it doesn't want the bridge. However, the contractor finishes the job and sues for the full price, but loses because of mitigation principles.

:p What are the two options available to the seller if goods aren’t ready for resale at the time of breach?
??x
The two options are:
1. Stop manufacturing the goods.
2. Manufacture the goods and then sell them.

The choice should be based on which option the seller reasonably believes will mitigate her loss to the greatest extent, thus minimizing the buyer’s liability.

#### Mitigation in Rockingham County v. Luten Bridge Co.
Background context: In this famous common law case, a county breached its contract with a bridge builder after construction had begun. The contractor finished the job and sued for the full price but lost because he did not mitigate his losses by either selling the partially completed work or finding another buyer.

:p What was the decision in Rockingham County v. Luten Bridge Co?
??x
The court held that the contractor couldn't recover for the completed bridge because it failed to mitigate its loss by selling the partially completed work or attempting to find another buyer.

#### Contract Breach and Damages Calculation for Labor and Materials
Background context: The contract price was $100,000 with expected expenses of $90,000 to yield a $10,000 profit. If the county breaches the contract at any point, the contractor should recover enough damages to cover its costs plus a$10,000 profit. The contractor's decision on whether to continue work is critical because it impacts both the contractor and the county.

:p What principle does the contractor follow when deciding to stop or continue work after a breach?
??x
The contractor must stop working if continuing would not result in additional benefits. This ensures that the contractor recovers its costs plus profit but prevents further losses to the breaching party (county). The decision is based on whether stopping or continuing would yield higher damages for the breaching party.
x??

---
#### UCC § 2-704(2) and Completion of Manufacture
Background context: Under UCC § 2-704(2), an aggrieved seller can either complete the manufacture of goods, identify them to the contract, or cease manufacturing. This decision is guided by reasonable commercial judgment to avoid loss and effective realization.

:p How does UCC § 2-704(2) allow a seller to handle unfinished goods when the buyer breaches?
??x
The seller can choose to:
1. Complete the manufacture of the goods.
2. Cease manufacturing and resell for scrap or salvage value.
3. Proceed in any other reasonable manner.

This decision is made with reasonable commercial judgment, aiming to mitigate loss and effectively realize value from the goods. The choice depends on the best course of action given the circumstances at the time of the decision, not necessarily on hindsight.

#### Market Damages for Goods Sale
Background context: If a seller breaches a contract for the sale of goods, they can either complete manufacture or stop and resell. UCC § 2-708 allows the seller to recover market damages if they did not reasonably try to mitigate their losses.

:p What does UCC § 2-708 allow a seller to do in case of breach?
??x
UCC § 2-708 permits the seller, upon breaching a contract for the sale of goods, to determine the market price and recover the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time of tender. The formula is:
$$\text{Damages} = \text{Contract Price} - \text{Market Price}$$

:p How does UCC § 2-708 handle the timing of market prices?
??x
The market price for determining damages under UCC § 2-708 is the price that the goods can be sold for at the time and place for tender. Tender means offering the performance, which in a shipment contract, occurs when the seller delivers the goods to the carrier.
x??

---
#### Reasonableness of Decisions
Background context: The decision on whether to complete or stop manufacture under UCC § 2-704(2) must be reasonable at the time it is made. Courts generally agree that a party should recover if they took reasonable steps to save the breaching party money, even if those steps backfired.

:p What principle ensures that the seller can still recover damages even if their decision turned out poorly?
??x
The principle of reasonableness in decision-making under UCC § 2-704(2) ensures that a seller who takes reasonable steps to mitigate losses and save the breaching party money is entitled to recovery, regardless of whether those actions ultimately result in financial loss for the seller.

:p How does this relate to the example where a machine becomes obsolete?
??x
In an example where the machine becomes obsolete after completion but could have been stopped earlier at lower damages ($40,000), the key is evaluating the reasonableness of the decision made by the seller. The outcome depends on whether the seller’s decision was reasonable when it was made, not on its current hindsight.

#### Market Damages Calculation
Background context: The example involves a contract where a buyer in Boston contracts to buy 100,000 bushels of winter wheat from a seller in Seattle at $7.50 per bushel. The market price on October 1 (tender date) was$7.00 per bushel. The formula for calculating the difference between contract and market prices is: 
$$\text{Market Damages} = (\text{Contract Price} - \text{Market Price}) \times \text{Quantity}$$:p What is the calculation of market damages in this scenario?
??x
The market damages can be calculated as follows:
$$\text{Market Damages} = (7.50 - 7.00) \times 100,000$$

This results in:
$$\text{Market Damages} = 0.50 \times 100,000 = 50,000$$

So the buyer owes the seller$50,000 in market damages.

#### Resale Rule and Lost Profits
Background context: The resale rule under UCC §2-706 states that if a seller successfully resells the goods after a breach by the buyer, the difference between the contract price and the resale price is the measure of damages. However, this rule does not always provide full compensation for lost profits.

:p How can a new-car dealer recover more than just the resale price minus the contract price?
??x
A new-car dealer might use the lost profits rule under UCC §2-708(2) to argue that even if it resells the goods, it is entitled to recover the profit it would have made. For example:
- If a car dealer contracts to sell you a $25,000 car and breaches immediately after finding another buyer for$25,000, the resale price equals the contract price.
- The dealer can claim lost profits because it could potentially sell two cars instead of one if the first sale had not been breached.

To calculate this, accountants would determine how much profit was lost due to the breach. For instance:
$$\text{Lost Profits} = (\text{Potential Sales Price} - \text{Cost}) - (\text{Actual Resale Price} - \text{Cost})$$

If the dealer could have sold another car for $25,000 and had a total cost of $18,750 (initial sale) + $6,250 (second sale) =$25,000:
$$\text{Lost Profits} = 25,000 - 18,750 - (25,000 - 18,750) = 6,250$$x??

#### Neri v. Retail Marine Case
Background context: In this case, Mr. Neri breached a contract to buy a boat from Retail Marine for $12,587. The shop incurred additional costs of $674 post-breach and sold the boat later for $12,587.

:p How did the court determine the measure of damages in this case?
??x
The court determined that Retail Marine should recover the lost profit from selling the boat only once rather than twice. The calculation is as follows:
- Potential Sales Profit: If Neri had not breached, the shop would have made $12,587 -$674 =$11,913.
- Actual Resale Price: Retail Marine resold the boat for $12,587 and incurred costs of$674.

The lost profit is:
$$\text{Lost Profit} = 11,913 - (12,587 - 674) = 11,913 - 11,913 = 2,579$$

Additionally, the court awarded$674 as incidental damages but denied attorney's fees.

#### Equitable Remedies Overview
Background context: The chapter discusses alternative remedies to contract law’s traditional monetary damages, including equitable relief. In Merry Old England, courts of law and equity were separate but today's American court systems combine these functions, though exceptions exist like Delaware.

:p What are the main differences between legal remedies and equitable remedies?
??x
Legal remedies typically involve money damages, while equitable remedies include specific performance or injunctions to compel or prevent certain actions. Legal remedies aim for financial compensation, whereas equitable remedies seek fairness and justice.
x??

---
#### Specific Performance: A Detailed Look
Background context: Specific performance is an equitable remedy ordering a party to perform their contractual obligations exactly as promised, often used in real estate contracts due to the unique nature of property.

:p When might a court grant specific performance?
??x
A court may grant specific performance when money damages are insufficient to settle a dispute. This is common with real estate contracts because each piece of property is unique and cannot be easily replaced by money.
x??

---
#### Injunction as an Equitable Relief Tool
Background context: An injunction is another form of equitable relief that orders a party not to do something, often used when monetary damages are inadequate.

:p How does an injunction typically work in practice?
??x
An injunction may induce parties to resolve their dispute by preventing one from performing an action. For example, the Metropolitan Opera might issue an injunction to prevent a singer from performing elsewhere on the night they were contracted.
x??

---
#### Why U.S. Courts Reluctantly Award Specific Performance
Background context: U.S. courts are hesitant to order specific performance because it could lead to debtors being imprisoned and because it involves supervising the performance, which can be cumbersome.

:p What are two main reasons U.S. courts avoid awarding specific performance?
??x
U.S. courts avoid specific performance primarily because:
1. It could imprison debtors, as violating a court order would result in contempt of court.
2. Supervising contract performance is problematic and time-consuming.
x??

---
#### Injunctions vs. Specific Performance: Key Differences
Background context: Both are equitable remedies but differ fundamentally—specific performance orders something to be done, while an injunction prevents something from happening.

:p How does the logic behind awarding specific performance differ from that of an injunction?
??x
The logic for specific performance is based on the uniqueness of what's being contracted for (like real estate), where money can't adequately compensate. An injunction, in contrast, aims to prevent a harmful action without requiring exact performance.
x??

---

#### Rescission of a Contract
Rescission is a remedy that allows parties to undo or reform a contract. This can happen when one party breaches the contract and cannot be adequately compensated through monetary damages alone. The goal is to return the non-breaching party to their pre-contractual position.
:p What is rescission in the context of contract law?
??x
Rescission in contract law refers to a remedy that allows parties to undo or reform a contract, essentially returning both parties to their positions before the contract was formed. This can be useful when monetary damages are insufficient to compensate for the breach.

#### Background on the Philadelphia Ball Club v. Lajoie Case
In 1901, Nap Lajoie signed with the Philadelphia Athletics of the American League after breaching his contract with the National League's Philadelphia Phillies. The court had to decide whether equitable relief was appropriate due to Lajoie’s unique status as a player.
:p What case set an early precedent for the treatment of unique players in breach of contract cases?
??x
The 1901 Philadelphia Ball Club v. Lajoie case established an early precedent for the treatment of unique players in breach of contract cases. The court concluded that if Nap Lajoie was a unique player, equitable relief (such as an injunction) would be appropriate to prevent him from playing for another team.
x??

---

#### Agreement of the Parties
Parties can mutually agree to terminate their contract and allocate payments, even without consideration. Each party receives something: release from contractual obligations.
:p How can parties mutually agree to terminate a contract?
??x
Parties can mutually agree to terminate a contract by mutual consent, as explained in Chapter 12. Even if they opt for no allocation of payment, the agreement to rescind still provides consideration because each party gets released from their contractual obligations.
x??

---

#### Successful Defense to Contract Formation
If one party successfully claims a defense that vitiates or undermines the contract (such as illegality, lack of consideration, mistake), equitable relief can be granted to ensure fairness.
:p Can a successful defense lead to rescission?
??x
Yes, if one party successfully claims a defense such as illegality, lack of consideration, mistake, etc., which vitiates or undermines the contract, equitable relief (such as rescission) can be granted by the court to ensure a fair outcome.
x??

---

#### Material Breach and Restitution
If there is a material breach, the non-breaching party can discharge their performance obligation and recover damages. The breaching party may also be entitled to restitution for any pre-breach work done.
:p What happens when there is a material breach of contract?
??x
When there is a material breach, the non-breaching party can declare that their performance under the contract is discharged and recover damages. The breaching party may also be entitled to restitution for any pre-breach work they performed, as per the Restatement (§ 374).
x??

#### Britton v. Turner Case
In 1834, Britton breached a one-year contract after nine and half months of work. The court allowed Turner to consider the contract ended and claim damages. However, Britton could not recover damages for breach because he did not substantially perform.
:p How was restitution handled in the Britton v. Turner case?
??x
In the 1834 Britton v. Turner case, Turner employed Britton for one year at $120, but Britton breached the contract after nine and half months. The court allowed Turner to consider the contract ended and claim damages. However, Britton could not recover any damages because he did not substantially perform; instead, his claim was in restitution for the value of the benefit he had conferred on Turner.
