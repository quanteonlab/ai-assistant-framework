#### Was a Contract Formed?
In contract law, one of the primary questions to ask is whether a valid contract was formed. This involves examining elements such as offer, acceptance, and consideration. If these elements are not clearly present, it may indicate that no binding agreement exists.
:p What question should be asked first when analyzing if a contract was formed in legal problems?
??x
The first question to ask is "Was a contract formed?" This involves checking for the presence of an offer, acceptance, and consideration. If these elements are not clear from the facts given, you need to look for specific details that might suggest their absence.

#### Reliance as a Basis for Enforceable Promises Without a Contract
Background context: In contract law, promises can sometimes be enforced even without a formal written or verbal agreement. This occurs through doctrines such as reliance and restitution. Reliance focuses on whether one party has reasonably relied on the promise to their detriment.

If a party relies on an unenforced promise by taking some action based on it, they may still have grounds for compensation under the doctrine of reliance. The remedy is typically limited to the extent of that reliance. For example, if you were promised $1,000 and spent $700 in reliance on that promise, you might only recover $700.

:p In contract law, what occurs when a party has relied on an unenforced promise by taking action based on it?
??x
If the court finds that the promisee reasonably relied on the promise to their detriment and incurred expenses as a result, they may be entitled to recovery of those expenses up to the extent of the reliance. The key is whether the reliance was reasonable.
```python
# Pseudocode for determining reasonableness of reliance
def is_reliance_reasonable(promised_amount, actual_expenses):
    if actual_expenses <= promised_amount:
        return True
    else:
        # Consider factors like proportionality and circumstances
        return False
```

#### Restitution as a Basis for Enforceable Promises Without a Contract
Background context: Restitution is another doctrine that allows for the enforcement of promises without a formal contract. It involves one party benefiting another, after which the beneficiary must give up the benefit if it would be unjust to retain it.

Restitution can compel a party to return or pay for a benefit conferred, often referred to as an "implied in law" contract. The remedy is generally the value of the benefit conferred, though this can be difficult to measure accurately.

:p In what situation might restitution be used to enforce an unenforced promise?
??x
Restitution may be used when one party has benefited another without a formal contract, and it would be unjust for the beneficiary to retain that benefit. The remedy typically involves returning or compensating for the value of the benefit conferred.
```python
# Pseudocode for calculating restitution amount
def calculate_restitution_amount(benefit_value):
    return benefit_value  # Assume full value is recoverable unless otherwise determined by court
```

#### Contractual Defenses: Illegality, Unconscionability, Capacity, etc.
Background context: Even if a contract has been formed through offer and acceptance, certain defenses can void or avoid it. These include illegality (the subject matter is illegal), unconscionability (terms are so unfair as to be shocking), lack of capacity (one party was unable to understand the agreement due to age, mental state, etc.), fraud, duress, undue influence, and mistake.

Defenses that void a contract generally render it non-existent. Those that avoid the contract make certain parts unenforceable but not necessarily the entire agreement.

:p What happens if a contract defense successfully voids or avoids a contract?
??x
If a defense successfully voids a contract, the parties didn't form an enforceable agreement. If it avoids the contract, specific parts of the agreement may be rendered non-enforceable, but other terms might still stand. The court aims to put the parties back in their original position.
```java
// Pseudocode for handling contract defenses
public class ContractDefenseHandler {
    public void handleDefenses(String defense) {
        if (defense.equals("illegality")) {
            // Void entire contract
        } else if (defense.equals("unconscionability")) {
            // Avoid specific terms
        }
        // Other defenses handled similarly
    }
}
```

#### Finding Terms in Statutes of Frauds and Parol Evidence Rule
Background context: Sometimes, contracts are required to be in writing according to statutes of frauds. A tip-off might be phrases like "A called B on the telephone and ordered a widget for $600." This raises questions about whether oral agreements are enforceable.

The parol evidence rule states that written agreements cannot be contradicted by prior or contemporaneous oral agreements unless specific exceptions apply, such as fraud or mistake. However, it also allows the court to fill in gaps where terms weren't explicitly stated.

:p How can you determine if a contract falls under the statute of frauds?
??x
You need to check whether the agreement involves certain types of transactions that state law requires to be in writing (e.g., sales of land, contracts for services lasting more than one year). If so, an oral agreement might not be enforceable.
```python
# Pseudocode for checking statute of frauds applicability
def is_statute_of_frauds_applicable(transaction_type):
    if transaction_type == "sale_of_land" or "services_over_one_year":
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

#### Identifying Implied Terms in Contracts
Background context: Even when contracts are in writing, gaps can exist where specific terms weren't agreed upon. Courts use various methods to fill these gaps, such as the parties' course of performance or dealing, trade usage, and default rules like implied warranties.

For example, in a sale of goods transaction, implied warranties may apply even if not explicitly written. Similarly, good faith and fair dealing obligations are often implied regardless of whether they're stated.

:p How does a court typically fill gaps in the terms of a contract?
??x
Courts use various methods to fill gaps in contracts. They may look at the parties' course of performance or dealings, applicable trade usage, and default rules like implied warranties. For instance, in sales of goods, courts often imply warranties even if not written explicitly.
```java
// Pseudocode for identifying implied terms
public class ContractTermFiller {
    public String fillInTerms(String agreementContext) {
        // Check for course of performance or dealing
        // Look up trade usage
        // Apply default rules like implied warranties
        return "Filling in terms based on the context provided.";
    }
}
```

#### Do the Parties’ Interpretations of the Contract’s Language Differ?
Background context: When parties have a dispute over the meaning of contract language, the court must determine whether the language is ambiguous. This may involve admitting extrinsic evidence and applying rules of interpretation.

:p Do the parties' interpretations of the contract's language differ, leading to a potential ambiguity issue?
??x
If the court finds that each party had its own reasonable but different meanings for an essential term, the question arises as to whether there is no enforceable contract due to misunderstanding. The court will consider extrinsic evidence and rules of interpretation to resolve this.

In such cases, the court may admit relevant extrinsic evidence (e.g., prior agreements, course of dealing) to clarify the ambiguous terms.

#### Is a Party in Breach?
Background context: A breach occurs when one party fails to perform as promised. There can be issues if performance is discharged due to modification or accord and satisfaction.

:p Can you identify whether a party is in breach based on performance?
??x
Yes, the issue of breach arises when one party did not perform according to the contract terms. However, discharge may arise through modifications or accord and satisfaction.

For example, suppose A agreed to sell B a widget for $400 but later agreed to reduce it to $350 after B’s request. If A then claims non-performance based on this modification, the court will determine if the modification was enforceable.
x??

#### Modification Issues
Background context: Modifications can be made after an initial agreement is formed, and their enforceability depends on various factors including the presence of a NOM clause.

:p How do you spot a modification issue in contract analysis?
??x
Look for facts indicating parties changed their initial agreement after it was made. For example, if B asked A to reduce the price from $400 to $350 and A agreed, this constitutes a subsequent modification.

If there is no NOM clause in the agreement, any oral modifications must be evaluated under the waiver doctrine to determine enforceability.

#### Discharge by Impracticability or Frustration
Background context: Discharge may occur due to impracticability (making performance impossible) or frustration of purpose (taking value out of the performance).

:p How can you identify an issue of discharge due to impracticability or frustration?
??x
Look for events after the contract formation that make it impossible or very difficult to perform, or take away the value of the performance. For instance, if a locust plague wipes out Farmer A’s crops just before harvest, this may excuse A's nonperformance.

The issue is whether such an event discharges the contract.
x??

---
#### Conditions Precedent
Background context: The Restatement defines conditions as events that are not certain to occur but must happen for performance to be due. This concept helps identify when a party’s failure to perform might be excused.

:p Did a condition have to occur before a performance was due?
??x
Conditions precedent must occur before a party is required to perform their obligations under the contract. For example, if A and B agreed that A would buy B's house only if A could get a mortgage, then A’s failure to purchase might be excused if they were unable to obtain a mortgage.

The key is identifying whether an event had to happen before performance was due.

#### Substantial Performance
Background context: Even if one party has not fully performed, the other may still have to perform their obligations. However, the non-breaching party can deduct damages based on any material breaches.

:p Is a party's "substantial performance" enough to excuse their breach?
??x
Substantial performance does not necessarily excuse a breach. The other party must still perform but may deduct damages for any material breaches. For example, if a builder completes a house except using Cohoes pipe instead of the specified Reading pipe, even though he substantially performed, the owner can refuse full payment and seek damages.

To determine substantial performance, ask whether the conditions that had to occur before performance were satisfied.
