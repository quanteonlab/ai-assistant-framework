**Starting Chapter:** Deciding Whether the Agreement Is Final and Complete

---

#### Parol Evidence Rule and Promises Made Before Signing
Background context: The parol evidence rule deals with whether oral agreements or promises made before or after signing a written contract can be admitted as evidence to modify or contradict the written agreement. If a promise was made before signing, it might be considered under this rule.
:p What happens if a party makes a promise before signing a written contract?
??x
If a party makes a promise before signing, it may fall under the parol evidence rule. The court would consider whether the oral promise is relevant to modifying or contradicting the written agreement.
??x
To determine this, you need to identify if there was consideration for the promise and whether the promise and its consideration are part of the same agreement as what's written in the contract.
---
#### Separate Consideration for a Promise
Background context: If separate consideration is offered for an additional promise not included in the original writing, it indicates that the parties entered into two distinct agreements. The parol evidence rule does not apply because both contracts can be separately enforceable.
:p What if there is separate consideration for a new promise after signing?
??x
If the seller promises to remove the ice house across the street and the buyer offers $50 specifically for this, then you have two separate agreements: one for the sale of the property and another oral agreement for removing the ice house. The parol evidence rule does not apply.
??x
In this case, both contracts can be separately enforceable. The statute of frauds might still require the written contract to be in writing, but the oral contract for $50 is valid.
---
#### Written vs. Separate Agreement
Background context: Determining whether a promise and its consideration are part of a separate agreement or if they are included within the same document affects how the parol evidence rule applies.
:p How does the parol evidence rule apply to written versus separate agreements?
??x
If the seller’s promises, including removing the ice house, are both part of the agreement, then any consideration offered by the buyer (e.g., a sum of money) would be considered for both promises. This is a true parol evidence problem.
??x
On the other hand, if the buyer offers separate consideration ($50) specifically to remove the ice house, this creates two separate agreements—one written and one oral—which allows the use of parol evidence since each agreement has its own terms.
---
#### Intent of the Parties
Background context: The parol evidence rule assesses whether parties intended their written agreement to be a final and complete statement. Courts can interpret subjective or objective intent, depending on which approach they follow.
:p How does the court determine if an agreement is final and complete?
??x
The court examines the negotiation process and looks for indicators that the signed document was intended as a final agreement. For example, several drafts being negotiated before signing suggest that the final contract should be considered final.
??x
Courts in the objective camp (like those influenced by Samuel Williston) will determine what reasonable parties would’ve intended under similar circumstances. This can help avoid a trial and streamline the process.
---
#### Merger Clause and Comprehensive Agreements
Background context: A merger clause states that no additional terms exist outside of the written contract, while comprehensive agreements are detailed and all-inclusive, making it less likely for parol evidence to be admitted.
:p What is a merger clause?
??x
A merger clause in a contract explicitly states that any prior negotiations or agreements between the parties have been fully integrated into the writing. This clause aims to prevent the admission of oral modifications or additional terms not included in the written agreement.
??x
Example: "This Agreement contains the entire understanding and agreement of the parties and supersedes all previous understandings, representations, or agreements." A contract with such a clause is more likely to be considered final and complete.

#### Application in Real Estate Contracts
Background context: In real estate transactions, reasonable people would typically include detailed terms like promises about property conditions (e.g., removing an ice house) in the written agreement due to its importance.
:p How does Mitchill v. Lath illustrate the parol evidence rule?
??x
In Mitchill v. Lath, a contract for the sale of real estate was involved, and the court reasoned that reasonable parties would include all relevant terms, including promises about property conditions like removing an ice house, in the written agreement.
??x
This case highlights the objective intent approach, where courts determine what reasonable people would have intended under similar circumstances without needing to hear from the specific parties.

#### Merger Clause in Contracts
Background context: A merger clause is often included in contracts to indicate that the writing constitutes a final and complete expression of the terms. However, courts do not always find this clause conclusive. The weight given to such clauses can vary depending on the type of contract.
:p What does a merger clause typically state?
??x
A merger clause typically states something like: "This writing constitutes a final written expression of the terms of this agreement and is a complete and exclusive statement of those terms." This indicates that no other agreements or terms outside of what is written are binding.
x??

#### Weight Given to Merger Clauses by Courts
Background context: Courts give more weight to merger clauses in negotiated contracts where both parties have worked out the details together. In contrast, for adhesion contracts (where one party imposes a standard form contract), the merger clause is less significant as the other party may not fully understand or negotiate its terms.
:p How do courts view the weight of merger clauses in different types of contracts?
??x
Courts give more weight to merger clauses in negotiated contracts because both parties have worked out the details together, indicating an intention for the writing to be final and complete. In contrast, for adhesion contracts, where one party imposes a standard form contract, courts give less weight to merger clauses since the other party may not have fully understood or negotiated its terms.

#### Parol Evidence Rule and Contract Integration
Background context: The parol evidence rule restricts the admission of oral or written statements made prior to or contemporaneous with a final agreement that contradict the integrated contract. However, it allows for evidence to supplement the contract if the writing is only partially integrated.
:p What does the parol evidence rule allow when the writing is only partially integrated?
??x
When the writing is only partially integrated, the parol evidence rule allows evidence to supplement the contract but not to contradict it. This means that evidence can be admitted to add terms or details that were omitted from the written agreement.
x??

---

#### Example of Supplementing vs Contradicting the Agreement
Background context: In a case where the writing is only partially integrated, parol evidence can be admitted to supplement the contract with additional terms not included in the writing. However, evidence that contradicts an existing term in the writing cannot be admitted.
:p Can both oral agreements in Mitchill v. Lath be admitted as evidence?
??x
No, only one of the oral agreements can be admitted: the promise to remove the ice house (supplementing the agreement) but not the change of closing date from March 1 to April 1 (contradicting a term in the written contract).
x??

---

#### Determining Completeness of Contract Writing
Background context: Courts decide whether a writing is complete based on legal standards. If it is found to be incomplete, evidence can be admitted to add terms that were not included but are necessary for the full understanding of the agreement.
:p How does a court determine if a contract writing is complete?
??x
A court determines if a contract writing is complete by assessing whether it constitutes a final and exclusive statement of the parties' intentions. If the court finds the writing to be incomplete, evidence can be admitted to add terms that were not included but are necessary for the full understanding of the agreement.
x??

---

#### Legal vs Factual Determinations in Parol Evidence
Background context: In cases where the writing is found to be only partially integrated, courts first make a legal determination about whether evidence should be admitted. If evidence is admitted, it then becomes a factual issue for the jury or judge to decide.
:p What are the two steps involved in deciding parol evidence admissibility?
??x
The two steps involved are:
1. A legal determination: Whether the writing is complete as a matter of law (complete integration vs partial integration).
2. A factual determination: If the writing is found to be partially integrated, whether the parties actually agreed to add terms through oral agreements.

#### UCC Parol Evidence Rule Overview
The UCC parol evidence rule closely mirrors the common-law rule but allows for some exceptions. Specifically, it permits explanations or supplements to a final and fully integrated writing through certain methods.

:p What is the main difference between the UCC parol evidence rule and the common-law rule?
??x
The primary difference lies in the exceptions provided by the UCC rule. While both rules generally prohibit contradicting terms stated in a final and fully integrated writing, the UCC allows for explanations or supplements through course of dealing, usage of trade, or course of performance.
x??

---

#### Course of Dealing as an Exception
Under Section 25-2-202(b) of the UCC, even if a contract is fully integrated, it can be supplemented by evidence of consistent additional terms unless the court finds that the writing was intended to be complete and exclusive.

:p Can course of dealing be used to supplement a final and fully integrated contract?
??x
Yes, according to the UCC parol evidence rule, course of dealing (the pattern of behavior established between parties in similar transactions) can be used to explain or supplement terms in a fully integrated contract. This is because these practices are considered part of the context of business operations.
x??

---

#### Usage of Trade as an Exception
Similar to course of dealing, usage of trade refers to industry-wide customs and practices that can be used to interpret ambiguous terms in a final and fully integrated writing.

:p Can usage of trade also supplement a final contract?
??x
Yes, the UCC parol evidence rule permits the use of usage of trade (industry-specific customary practices) to explain or supplement a final and fully integrated contract. This is because these practices are widely accepted within the relevant industry.
x??

---

#### Course of Performance as an Exception
The course of performance refers to the actual conduct by which parties perform their obligations under a contract, even after it has been written.

:p Can evidence of course of performance be used to supplement a final contract?
??x
Yes, according to Section 25-2-202(a) of the UCC parol evidence rule, the course of performance (the actual behavior in carrying out contractual duties) can be used to explain or supplement terms in a fully integrated contract. This is because it reflects the practical execution of the agreement.
x??

#### Example Scenario with Course of Dealing
An example involving course of dealing: A seller and buyer sign a fully integrated contract stating that the widget price is $1,000 payable 30 days after delivery. Seven days post-delivery, the buyer pays $950 instead of $1,000.

:p Can this scenario be used to argue for a course of dealing?
??x
Yes, if there's evidence that in previous transactions between these parties, they consistently applied a 5% discount for early payment within ten days (course of dealing), this could be used to explain or supplement the writing. The court would consider whether such practices can coexist with the written terms.

#### International Contracts and CISG
The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) does not have a parol evidence rule. It allows courts to interpret statements and other conduct based on intent.

:p How does the CISG differ from UCC in handling parol evidence?
??x
Under the CISG, parties can provide evidence that contradicts or supplements the written agreement if it reflects their true intentions during negotiations. This is different from the UCC, where such evidence is generally excluded unless the writing isn't intended to be a complete and exclusive statement of the terms.
x??

---

#### Example with CISG Interpretation
In an international marble sale case, the buyer complained about quality issues based on pre-contractual statements not included in the final form.

:p Can pre-contractual statements still influence interpretation under CISG?
??x
Yes, if there's evidence that before signing, both parties agreed that certain terms wouldn't be part of their agreement (e.g., a method for making complaints), this could be considered by the court under Article 8(1) of the CISG. The key is whether the other party knew or should have known about these intentions.
