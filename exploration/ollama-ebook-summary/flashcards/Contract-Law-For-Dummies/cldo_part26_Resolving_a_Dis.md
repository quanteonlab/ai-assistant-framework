**Starting Chapter:** Resolving a Dispute through Alternative Dispute Resolution

---

#### Choice-of-Forum Clause
Background context explaining that a choice-of-forum clause is an agreement between parties to litigate disputes in a specific jurisdiction, often where one party has more power (like a company). Even if such clauses are part of contracts of adhesion (standardized agreements), courts may uphold them under certain conditions.
:p What does a choice-of-forum clause do?
??x
A choice-of-forum clause allows parties to agree on which court or jurisdiction will hear disputes arising from their contract. This can sometimes be challenged as unconscionable if it is buried in fine print and causes inconvenience or financial hardship to one party, but courts may still uphold them.
x??

---

#### Adhesion Contracts
Background context explaining that an adhesion contract is a take-it-or-leave-it agreement where the terms are non-negotiable. Courts typically scrutinize these contracts more closely for fairness and unconscionability.
:p What defines an adhesion contract?
??x
An adhesion contract is one in which the terms are drafted by one party (typically a business) without negotiation, and the other party must accept them or not do business at all. These contracts can be scrutinized more closely by courts for fairness and unconscionability.

#### Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)
Background context explaining that ADR methods allow parties to resolve disputes outside of court, potentially saving time and money. Common types include arbitration and mediation.
:p What is the purpose of alternative dispute resolution?
??x
The purpose of ADR is to provide a faster, less formal, and often cheaper way for parties to resolve disputes compared to traditional litigation. Methods like arbitration and mediation can be more flexible and less adversarial than court proceedings.
x??

---

#### Arbitration vs Mediation
Background context explaining that both are forms of ADR but differ in how binding they are. Arbitration involves a decision by an arbitrator, which is often binding, while mediation does not have a binding decision; it focuses on reaching a mutual agreement.
:p What are the key differences between arbitration and mediation?
??x
Arbitration involves a third party who makes a binding decision after hearing both sides of a dispute. Mediation, on the other hand, involves a mediator who helps the parties reach an agreement but does not have the power to make a final decision. Arbitration decisions are generally binding unless specified otherwise.
x??

---

#### Binding vs Non-Binding Arbitration
Background context explaining that arbitration can be either binding or non-binding depending on the terms of the contract. In binding arbitration, the arbitrator's decision is final and enforceable in court; in non-binding arbitration, parties can still go to court if they disagree with the arbitrator.
:p What does it mean for an arbitration clause to be binding?
??x
A binding arbitration clause means that the parties have agreed upfront that the arbitrator’s decision will be final and can be enforced by a court. This makes arbitration decisions as authoritative as court judgments, but with potentially faster resolution times and less formality.
x??

---

#### Benefits of Arbitration
Background context listing several benefits of arbitration over traditional litigation, including cost savings, speedier resolutions, and flexibility in the decision-making process.
:p What are some key benefits of arbitration?
??x
Arbitration offers several advantages over litigation:
- Less expensive: Parties pay for the arbitrator instead of court costs and attorney fees.
- Faster: Arbitrators can limit or expedite discovery procedures that often slow down court cases.
- More flexible: Arbitrators aren't bound by strict rules of law, allowing for creative solutions.
- Less formal: Proceedings are typically less formal than in a courtroom.
- Less controversial: Decisions tend to be straightforward and final.
- Private: There is no public record of the proceedings.
x??

#### Federal Arbitration Act (FAA)
Background context explaining that the FAA supports arbitration by providing that courts cannot invalidate an arbitration clause unless it violates existing contract revocation laws. The U.S. Supreme Court has issued several opinions supporting arbitration under this act.
:p What does the Federal Arbitration Act do?
??x
The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) supports arbitration by stipulating that courts cannot invalidate an arbitration clause “save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.” This means that a court can't declare an arbitration clause unconscionable just because it's part of an arbitration agreement.
x??

---

#### Mediation Benefits
Background context detailing several benefits of mediation, including personal empowerment, less adversarial atmosphere, and more durable solutions due to mutual ownership of the resolution process.
:p What are the key benefits of mediation?
??x
Mediation offers several advantages over traditional litigation:
- Personal empowerment: Parties have more control over the dispute resolution process.
- More conducive to peacemaking: The focus is on finding a mutually satisfactory solution, not just winning.
- More durable solutions: Because parties take ownership of the resolution, they are likely to comply and less likely to appeal decisions.
- Fewer unresolved issues: Mediation can address emotional and personal losses that fall outside legal remedies.

#### Third Parties in Contract Law
In contract law, most agreements focus on the relationship between the contracting parties. However, there are situations where third parties—individuals or groups not directly involved in the original agreement—have an interest in the contract. These third-party interests can be significant and are often addressed through specific legal doctrines such as third-party beneficiaries, tortious interference, assignment of rights, and delegation of duties.
:p What is a third party in the context of contract law?
??x
A third party in contract law refers to individuals or groups who are not directly involved in the original agreement but have an interest in it. These parties can benefit from or be affected by the terms of the contract despite not being signatories themselves.
x??
---
#### Third-Party Beneficiaries
Third-party beneficiaries are a specific category of third parties who gain rights directly from the contract, even though they are not signatories to the agreement. For example, if an employer agrees to pay a contractor for services that will also benefit an employee, the employee could become a third-party beneficiary.
:p What is a third-party beneficiary?
??x
A third-party beneficiary in contract law is an individual or entity who, by virtue of the contract between other parties, acquires a direct right to enforce the terms of the agreement. This means that even though they are not signatories to the contract, they can seek legal remedies based on the promises made within it.
x??
---
#### Tortious Interference with Contracts
Tortious interference involves situations where one party intentionally interferes with another party's contractual relationship, causing harm or loss. This can include situations where a third party disrupts an existing business relationship by inducing one of the original contracting parties to breach their contract.
:p What is tortious interference?
??x
Tortious interference refers to the act of interfering with the contractual relations between two other parties in a manner that causes them harm or loss. This can involve a third party who intentionally disrupts an existing business relationship, persuading one party to breach its agreement with another.
x??
---
#### Assignment of Rights
The assignment of rights allows one contracting party (the assignor) to transfer their rights under the contract to another party (the assignee). For example, if a tenant's landlord agrees to lease property to someone else, the tenant might be assigned the right to receive rent from the new lessee.
:p What is the assignment of rights?
??x
The assignment of rights in contract law refers to the process where one contracting party (the assignor) legally transfers their rights under the agreement to another party (the assignee). This can include transferring benefits, such as receiving payments or enjoying certain privileges stipulated in the original contract.
x??
---
#### Delegation of Duties
Delegation of duties involves a party's ability to transfer its obligations under the contract to another entity. For instance, if a contractor agrees to build a house but cannot complete the work due to unforeseen circumstances, they might delegate their duty to complete the job to another company.
:p What is the delegation of duties?
??x
Delegation of duties in contract law refers to the process where one party (the delegator) transfers its obligations under an agreement to another entity (the delegatee). This can be useful when a party finds it necessary or beneficial to have someone else fulfill their contractual responsibilities.
x??

#### Third-Party Beneficiaries
Background context: This section discusses third-party beneficiaries, individuals who are not parties to a contract but can enforce its terms. The focus is on understanding how and when these third parties qualify as beneficiaries.

:p What determines whether a party qualifies as a third-party beneficiary?
??x
The determination of whether a party qualifies as a third-party beneficiary hinges on the intent of the contracting parties. According to the Restatement (Second) of Contracts, a beneficiary can be either intended or incidental. For an intended beneficiary:
1. The performance of the promise will satisfy an obligation of the promisee to pay money to the beneficiary.
2. Circumstances indicate that the promisee intends to give the beneficiary the benefit of the promised performance.

For an incidental beneficiary, there is no specific intent from the parties, and their interest in the contract is less direct or secondary.

If a third party has only an incidental interest, they do not have enforceable rights under the contract.
x??

---

#### Intended Beneficiary
Background context: An intended third-party beneficiary is someone explicitly intended by both contracting parties to benefit from a promise made within the contract. The Restatement (Second) of Contracts provides specific criteria for determining if a party is an intended beneficiary.

:p How does one determine whether a third party is considered an intended beneficiary?
??x
To determine whether a third party is considered an intended beneficiary, you need to examine the intent of both contracting parties and check if either of the following conditions are met:
1. The performance of the promise will satisfy an obligation of the promisee to pay money to the beneficiary.
2. Circumstances indicate that the promisee intends to give the beneficiary the benefit of the promised performance.

If these conditions apply, the third party is likely an intended beneficiary and can enforce the contract terms against the promisee if their rights are violated.

Example: If a contractor agrees to build a fence for Party A, who benefits from the improved property value, but also promises in writing that they will personally compensate Party B (a neighbor) for any noise during construction, then Party B could be considered an intended beneficiary.
x??

---

#### Incidental Beneficiary
Background context: An incidental third-party beneficiary is someone whose interest in a contract arises from circumstances rather than explicit intent. Unlike intended beneficiaries, their rights are less certain and more limited.

:p How does one determine whether a third party is an incidental beneficiary?
??x
An incidental third-party beneficiary's status can be determined by examining the following:
1. The contracting parties do not explicitly intend that the third party benefit from the promise.
2. The third party’s interest in the contract is secondary or indirect.

Incidental beneficiaries generally cannot enforce the contract terms directly but may have some rights, such as a claim for restitution if their reliance interests are harmed.

Example: If Party A rents an apartment to Party B and agrees with Landlord C that they will not rent it out elsewhere while Party B lives there, this agreement might benefit D (a friend of Party B), who could rely on the agreement but would likely not have enforceable rights.
x??

---

#### Contracting Parties’ Intent
Background context: The key to determining whether a third party can be a beneficiary lies in the intent of the contracting parties. This is particularly relevant under the Restatement (Second) of Contracts.

:p How does the intent of the contracting parties affect the status of a third party as a beneficiary?
??x
The intent of the contracting parties is crucial in determining if a third party qualifies as a beneficiary. Under the Restatement (Second) of Contracts, there are two categories:
1. **Intended Beneficiary**: If both parties intend that a third party should benefit from the contract and either condition (a) or (b) applies.
2. **Incidental Beneficiary**: If no such intent exists, and the third party's interest is secondary.

To establish this intent, courts consider various factors, including the terms of the agreement, conduct of the parties, and any written agreements that indicate the intention to benefit a third party.

Example: In a contract where Seller A sells goods to Buyer B but also promises that they will not sell to Competitor C for one year, if there is no explicit mention in the contract benefiting C, C might be an incidental beneficiary.
x??

---

#### Interference with Contract
Background context: The text introduces scenarios where third parties interfere with existing contracts, potentially causing harm. Understanding this concept is crucial for assessing liability and legal implications.

:p How can a third party interfere with a contract between two other parties?
??x
A third party can interfere with a contract in various ways, often by inducing one of the contracting parties to breach their agreement or otherwise undermine the contract's performance. This interference can result in damages if it disrupts the contractual relationship and causes harm.

For example:
- Offering higher incentives to induce a party to break an existing agreement.
- Threatening legal action that distracts from fulfilling obligations.

If such interference leads to a breach of contract, the non-breaching party may have grounds for legal action against the interfering third party under tortious interference with contract principles.

Example: If Supplier A breaches its contract with Manufacturer B by providing better terms to Competitor C, and this causes B financial loss, B might seek damages from C for tortiously interfering with the contract.
x??

---

#### Rights of Third-Party Beneficiaries
Background context: This section discusses the rights and limitations of third-party beneficiaries. Understanding these rights is essential in cases where a third party may have been intended or incidental.

:p What are the rights of a third-party beneficiary?
??x
Third-party beneficiaries, especially intended ones, generally have enforceable rights to the promised performance under the contract. These rights can be enforced against the promisor (the other contracting party) if their obligations are breached. However, there are some limitations:
- Incidental beneficiaries do not typically have enforceable rights.
- Rights may vary based on local laws and specific circumstances.

For intended beneficiaries, key rights include:
1. The right to demand performance of the promised obligation by the promisor.
2. The right to sue for breach if the promisor fails to perform as agreed.
3. The right to any compensation or damages resulting from a breach.

Example: If Party A contracts with Party C to provide services that benefit Party B, and C breaches the contract, B can sue C directly for the promised performance or compensation.

```java
public class ContractViolation {
    public void enforceThirdPartyRights(String beneficiary) {
        // Code to check if beneficiary is an intended party
        if (isIntendedBeneficiary(beneficiary)) {
            System.out.println("Enforcing rights of " + beneficiary);
            // Logic to seek performance or compensation
        } else {
            System.out.println("Incidental beneficiaries do not have enforceable rights.");
        }
    }

    private boolean isIntendedBeneficiary(String beneficiary) {
        // Check if the party is an intended beneficiary based on contract terms
        return true; // Placeholder logic
    }
}
```

#### Creating a Creditor Beneficiary

Background context: A creditor beneficiary is created when performance of one party's promise will satisfy another party's obligation to pay money to a third party. The focus here is on determining if the parties intended to create such a relationship, which would allow the third party (creditor beneficiary) to sue for payment.

:p What is a creditor beneficiary in contract law?
??x
A creditor beneficiary is someone who can enforce a promise made by one party (the promisor) to another party (the promisee) if performance of the promise will satisfy an obligation of the promisee to pay money to the creditor beneficiary. In this context, John sells a widget to Peter for $100 and tells Peter to pay the$100 to Terry instead of to himself.
x??

---

#### Determining Intention to Create a Creditor Beneficiary

Background: To determine if there is an intention to create a creditor beneficiary, two main criteria must be met. First, identify the promise that the third party seeks to enforce, and second, ensure performance will satisfy the promisor's obligation to pay money.

:p How do you determine whether parties intend to create a creditor beneficiary?
??x
1. Identify the promise that the third party is seeking to enforce.
2. Confirm if the performance of this promise satisfies an obligation of the promisee to pay money to the beneficiary.
In John’s example, Terry seeks Peter's payment of $100 to satisfy her debt to John. Since Peter's payment would fulfill John's obligation to pay Terry, Terry can be considered a creditor beneficiary and sue Peter.
x??

#### Securing Rights of Third-Party Beneficiaries

Background: For many years, American contract law did not recognize the rights of third-party beneficiaries due to difficulty in identifying valid consideration. The Lawrence v. Fox case (1859) marked a significant shift by allowing beneficiaries to enforce promises made on their behalf.

:p What is an example of when a court allowed a third party to sue for a breach of contract?
??x
In the 1859 New York case, Holly owed Lawrence $300. Holly loaned Fox $300, and in return, Fox promised to pay the $300 to Lawrence to satisfy Holly’s debt. When Fox didn't pay, Lawrence sued Fox based on a principle found in law of trusts that allowed third-party beneficiaries to enforce promises made for their benefit.

#### Real-World Application: Mortgage Assumption

Background: In real estate transactions, when you sell your house with an existing mortgage and the new buyer assumes it, you want to know if the bank can go after them if they default. This involves determining whether the bank is a third-party beneficiary.

:p How do banks determine their rights in a mortgage assumption scenario?
??x
1. Identify the promise being made: In this case, the seller (you) sells the house and the new buyer assumes the mortgage.
2. Determine if performance of the promise will satisfy an obligation to pay money to the bank. If the new buyer defaults, the bank has the right to seek payment from them as they assumed the mortgage.

For example, suppose you sell your house with a $100,000 mortgage and Terry assumes it. If Terry doesn't pay, the bank can sue her for breach of contract.

#### Summary

These flashcards cover key concepts in creating creditor beneficiaries, determining their intent, historical context, and real-world applications. Understanding these principles is crucial for recognizing third-party rights and liabilities in contractual arrangements.

#### Third-Party Beneficiary: Promisee's Intent to Benefit Beneficiary

Background context explaining the concept. According to the Restatement, a third party is a third-party beneficiary if “the promisee intends to give the beneficiary the benefit of the promised performance.” This means that when A and B make a contract where A gets B to promise something to C, C can sue B for enforcement if A intended this outcome.

If applicable, add code examples with explanations.
:p What is the question about this concept?
??x
Is Terry’s bank a third-party beneficiary in the scenario described? Explain why or why not based on the Restatement criteria.
x??

---
#### Assumption of Mortgage

Background context explaining the concept. Most mortgages today include provisions that explicitly state that the mortgage isn’t assumable and that the balance is due upon sale of the property.

If applicable, add code examples with explanations:
```java
// Example code to illustrate the non-assumability provision in a mortgage contract
public class MortgageContract {
    private String nonAssumableClause;

    public MortgageContract(String clause) {
        this.nonAssumableClause = clause;
    }

    public boolean isAssumable() {
        return !nonAssumableClause.contains("assumable");
    }
}
```
:p Is the bank a third-party beneficiary if Terry tries to sell the property? Why or why not?
??x
No, in this case, even though the bank could be considered as benefiting from the transaction (since it would receive payment), the mortgage agreement explicitly states that it isn't assumable and that the balance is due upon sale. This means there was no intent by Terry to give the bank the benefit of the promise; hence, the bank cannot enforce the promise through a third-party beneficiary claim.
x??

---
#### Donor Beneficiary

Background context explaining the concept. A donor beneficiary occurs when A and B make a contract in which A gets B to promise something to C as part of the deal. For example, John sells a widget to Peter for $100, telling Peter to pay that amount to his favorite charity.

If applicable, add code examples with explanations:
```java
// Example code to illustrate a donor beneficiary scenario
public class CharityDonation {
    private String donationAmount;
    private Beneficiary charity;

    public CharityDonation(String amount, Beneficiary charity) {
        this.donationAmount = amount;
        this.charity = charity;
    }

    public void payDonation() throws Exception {
        if (charity == null || !donationReceived()) {
            throw new Exception("Charity not specified or donation was not received.");
        }
        // Process payment to the charity
    }

    private boolean donationReceived() {
        return true; // Assume successful transaction for demonstration purposes
    }
}
```
:p Can John’s favorite charity sue Peter for $100 if John instructs him to pay it? Explain your reasoning.
??x
Yes, because in this scenario, John (the promisee) intended to give the benefit of the promised performance ($100) to his favorite charity (the beneficiary). Therefore, the charity can sue Peter to enforce the promise based on the Restatement criteria for a third-party beneficiary.
x??

---
#### Incidental Beneficiary

Background context explaining the concept. An incidental beneficiary is someone who benefits from the contract but was not intended by the parties to benefit directly. The test involves determining if there's an intention to benefit that third party.

If applicable, add code examples with explanations:
```java
// Example code to illustrate an incidental beneficiary scenario
public class Contract {
    private String benefitingParty;
    private boolean isIntendedBeneficiary;

    public Contract(String party, boolean isIntended) {
        this.benefitingParty = party;
        this.isIntendedBeneficiary = isIntended;
    }

    public void checkIncidentalBeneficiary() {
        if (!isIntendedBeneficiary && benefitingParty != null) {
            System.out.println(benefitingParty + " is an incidental beneficiary.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("No incidental beneficiaries found.");
        }
    }
}
```
:p Can a charity be considered an incidental beneficiary in any of the scenarios described? Explain your reasoning.
??x
No, based on the scenarios provided, neither the bank nor the charity can be considered incidental beneficiaries. In both cases—Terry’s mortgage and the donor beneficiary example—the parties explicitly intended to benefit those third parties directly (the bank or the charity). Therefore, they are not incidental beneficiaries but rather third-party beneficiaries.
x??

---

#### Is the Third Party Named in the Contract?
Background context: To determine whether a third party is a beneficiary, one of the initial questions to ask is if they are named in the contract. While simply naming someone does not automatically make them a beneficiary, it often indicates an intention to benefit that person.
:p Was Midtown Motors explicitly named as the recipient of your promise to buy you a new Mercedes?
??x
No, Midtown Motors was not explicitly named as the recipient of your promise to purchase the Mercedes. You intended the purchase for yourself in payment for research work.
x??

---

#### Does Performance Run to That Third Party?
Background context: Another indicator of whether a third party is a beneficiary is whether performance runs directly to that party. If it does, there’s a higher likelihood that the intention was to benefit them.
:p In our scenario, did Midtown Motors receive any direct performance from the contract?
??x
No, Midtown Motors did not receive any direct performance from the contract. You were purchasing the Mercedes for yourself as payment, and therefore, their involvement was only incidental.
x??

---

#### Did the Promisee Intend to Benefit the Third Party?
Background context: Ultimately, determining whether a third party is a beneficiary comes down to intent. The promisee (the person to whom the promise is made) must have intended to benefit that third party.
:p How would you determine if Professor Burnham intended Midtown Motors to be benefited by your research work contract?
??x
Professor Burnham did not intend Midtown Motors to be benefited by your research work contract. The intent was for you to receive compensation with a Mercedes, and the involvement of Midtown Motors was only incidental.
x??

---

#### Example Scenario with Government Contracts
Background context: Government contracts often involve public interests rather than specific beneficiaries. To determine if third parties are intended beneficiaries, one must consider whether the government's intent was to benefit those directly affected or the general welfare.
:p In the case where a business is contracted by the government to retrain unemployed workers and fails to do so, who would likely have a claim against the business?
??x
Unemployed workers probably would not have a claim against the business. The government's intent in contracting with the business was to serve the general good of reducing unemployment, rather than to benefit any specific worker.
x??

---

#### Contractual Naming and Intent
Background context: In naming a third party within a contract, it is crucial to understand whether this act indicates an intention to create a legal relationship. Often, such naming serves other purposes like insurance policies where the beneficiary is clearly intended to receive benefits.
:p If you were to name Midtown Motors in your contract as the place for purchasing a car, would they be considered a third-party beneficiary?
??x
No, if you named Midtown Motors in the contract solely as the place for purchasing a car (i.e., to facilitate payment), it is unlikely that they would be considered a third-party beneficiary. The intention was not to benefit them directly.
x??

---

#### Summary of Identifying Third-Party Beneficiaries
Background context: Determining whether someone qualifies as a third-party beneficiary involves asking several key questions, including if the party is named in the contract, if performance runs to that party, and if the promisee intended to benefit the third party. These questions can help clarify the nature of the relationship.
:p How would you summarize the process for identifying third-party beneficiaries?
??x
To identify a third-party beneficiary:
1. Check if the third party is named in the contract.
2. Determine if performance runs directly to that third party.
3. Assess whether the promisee intended to benefit the third party.

These steps help determine if someone qualifies as a third-party beneficiary and can be instrumental in legal disputes involving such contracts.
