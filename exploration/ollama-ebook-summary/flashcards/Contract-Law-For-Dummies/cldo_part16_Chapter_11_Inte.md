**Starting Chapter:** Chapter 11 Interpreting Contracts. Grasping the Basics of Ambiguity

---

#### Ambiguity vs. Vagueness

Background context: This concept involves understanding the differences between ambiguity and vagueness, which are crucial for interpreting contracts accurately.

Vagueness refers to words or phrases that have an uncertain meaning but revolve around a narrow range of meanings. On the other hand, ambiguity arises when a word or phrase has two or more conflicting meanings.

Ambiguity can often lead to disputes as one party might interpret contract language differently from another. For example, "oranges and grapefruit from Florida" could be interpreted as either including both fruits from Florida or just grapefruit from Florida.

Vagueness, such as using terms like "reasonable," "satisfactory," "usual," or "promptly," can provide flexibility but may also lead to uncertainty in determining compliance.

:p How do ambiguity and vagueness differ?
??x
Ambiguity involves conflicting meanings of a word or phrase, leading to potential disputes. Vagueness, on the other hand, uses terms that have an uncertain meaning but are within a narrow range. For instance, "promptly" can depend on the context, making it vague but not ambiguous.

#### Resolving Ambiguity

Background context: Contract law provides several techniques to resolve ambiguities when they arise in written agreements.

One common method is the **Golden Rule** (also known as the Doctrine of Equivalence): This rule aims to interpret a contract such that no clause will be rendered superfluous, absurd, or inequitable. If one party's interpretation would make part of the agreement meaningless, then that interpretation should be avoided.

Another technique involves looking at the **context and purpose** of the contract: Understanding why the parties entered into the agreement can help clarify ambiguous terms.

:p What is a common method for resolving ambiguities in contracts?
??x
The Golden Rule (or Doctrine of Equivalence) is commonly used to interpret contracts so that no clause is rendered superfluous, absurd, or inequitable. If one interpretation would make part of the agreement meaningless, it should be avoided.
x??

---

#### Vague Words as Tools

Background context: In contract drafting, using vague words like "reasonable," "satisfactory," "usual," and "promptly" can provide some flexibility but may also lead to disputes over compliance.

These terms are often used because they give parties breathing room in their interpretation. For example, "Buyer must give notice of defects promptly after receipt of the goods" is vague compared to an explicit time limit, making it harder to determine if a party has complied.

:p What role do vague words like "reasonable," "satisfactory," and "promptly" play in contract drafting?
??x
Vague words such as "reasonable," "satisfactory," and "promptly" serve as tools for providing flexibility. They give parties some leeway in interpreting the terms, but can also lead to disputes over compliance because their meaning can vary based on context or circumstances.
x??

---

#### Calculated Ambiguity

Background context: Sometimes, parties intentionally leave certain terms ambiguous to hold a deal together when they are deadlocked during negotiations.

For example, in labor agreements, "cost of living adjustment" could mean different things to employees and management. To avoid immediate disagreement, the parties might agree to address the ambiguity later rather than suffer the consequences of having no agreement at all.

:p Can ambiguity ever be intentionally created in contracts?
??x
Yes, sometimes parties intentionally create ambiguity in contracts (called "calculated ambiguity") when they are deadlocked during negotiations and prefer an agreement with possible future uncertainty over no agreement at all. This can involve terms like "cost of living adjustment" that can have different interpretations.
x??

---

#### Clear Language in Contract Drafting

Background context: To avoid ambiguities, it is best practice to use clear, unambiguous language when drafting contracts.

Clear and explicit wording helps prevent disputes by leaving no room for multiple interpretations. For example, using "Buyer must give notice of defects within 10 days after receipt of the goods" makes the terms clearer than ambiguous phrases like "Notice of defects must be given within 10 days."

:p Why is clear language important in contract drafting?
??x
Clear language in contract drafting is essential because it helps prevent disputes by leaving no room for multiple interpretations. Using explicit wording ensures that both parties understand their obligations, reducing the likelihood of future conflicts.
x??

#### Two-Step Interpretation Process for Ambiguous Language
Background context: When dealing with allegedly ambiguous language in a contract, courts break down the task into two steps. The first step is to determine whether the language is ambiguous, and the second step is to decide what the meaning of that language should be.
:p What are the two steps involved in interpreting allegedly ambiguous language in a contract?
??x
The court first decides whether certain language is ambiguous (a question of law) by considering relevant evidence. If it finds the language ambiguous, then it determines the meaning using admissible evidence and appropriate interpretation techniques. If not ambiguous, the court may declare the meaning directly.
??x

---

#### Step 1: Determining Ambiguity
Background context: The first step in interpreting a contract is to determine whether the allegedly ambiguous language is indeed ambiguous. This involves making a legal determination based on various forms of evidence.
:p How does the court decide whether certain language in a contract is ambiguous?
??x
The court decides if the language is ambiguous by considering the entire document and relevant evidence, such as the context, course of performance, or trade usage. The parol evidence rule typically does not come into play here; instead, the focus is on determining the meaning of the existing terms.
??x

---

#### Step 2: Declaring Meaning
Background context: If the court finds that the language in a contract is ambiguous, it then needs to determine the meaning using admissible evidence. This step may involve the use of jury decisions for fact questions.
:p What happens if the court determines that certain language in a contract is ambiguous?
??x
If the language is found to be ambiguous, the court must decide which evidence is admissible and how to interpret it to find the intended meaning. If determining the meaning involves factual issues, a jury may be used to resolve those questions.
??x

---

#### Evidence for Ambiguity Determination
Background context: Various resources can help courts determine whether certain language in a contract is ambiguous. These resources range from the contract itself to more subjective methods involving testimony and contextual understandings.
:p What are some of the resources courts may use to determine if certain language in a contract is ambiguous?
??x
Courts may consult:
- The language of the contract
- Rules of interpretation
- Course of performance, course of dealing, and trade usage
- Objective sources such as dictionaries
- Contextual understandings of the parties
- Testimony of the parties and their attorneys
??x

---

#### Parol Evidence Rule in Ambiguity Determinations
Background context: The parol evidence rule is not directly applied when determining whether language in a contract is ambiguous. Instead, courts use it to find the terms of the contract.
:p How does the parol evidence rule relate to ambiguity determinations?
??x
The parol evidence rule helps identify the actual terms of the contract but is not used in determining ambiguity. Once the terms are identified, courts use other methods and evidence to determine if those terms are ambiguous and, if so, their meaning.
??x

---

#### Determining Ambiguity vs. Meaning
Background context: The process of deciding whether certain language is ambiguous and then determining its meaning overlap significantly. Both processes may use similar techniques and evidence, but the focus shifts from identifying terms to interpreting their meaning.
:p How do the processes of determining ambiguity and determining meaning in a contract interrelate?
??x
Both processes involve using various resources like the contract text, rules of interpretation, contextual understandings, etc., but the focus changes. In the first step, the court determines if language is ambiguous; in the second, it seeks to interpret that language based on admissible evidence.
??x

---

#### Example of Using Resources for Ambiguity Determination
Background context: Courts may use a range of resources when deciding whether certain contract language is ambiguous and what its meaning should be. These include objective sources like dictionaries and subjective understandings from the parties involved.
:p Can you provide an example of how courts might use different resources to determine if language in a contract is ambiguous?
??x
For instance, if a contract term "delivery" is disputed:
- The court could consult a dictionary definition (Objective source)
- Examine past dealings between the parties regarding delivery times (Contextual understandings)
- Hear from witnesses about industry standards for similar contracts (Testimony of parties and attorneys)
??x

---
#### Plain-Meaning Rule
Background context explaining that according to the plain-meaning rule, courts should only look at the contract itself to determine whether its language is ambiguous. If a judge finds the meaning clear upon reading the contract, they won’t consider other evidence about what the contract means or the parties’ intentions.
:p What does the plain-meaning rule state regarding how courts interpret contracts?
??x
The plain-meaning rule states that courts should only look at the contract itself to determine whether its language is ambiguous. If a judge reads the contract and finds the meaning clear, they won’t consider other evidence about what the contract means or the parties’ intentions.
x??

---
#### Contextual Interpretation within Plain-Meaning Rule
Background context explaining that while the plain-meaning rule suggests looking only at the contract, courts may still consider context in certain situations. For example, if a contract uses terms like "floor" and "ceiling," the court might look at the context to determine the type of contract (e.g., construction or financing).
:p Can you give an example where contextual interpretation is necessary within the plain-meaning rule?
??x
Yes, for instance, if a contract includes terms such as "floor" and "ceiling," the court might look at the context to determine whether it's a construction contract or a financing arrangement. The court would consider this context only to understand what is reasonably meant in that specific context.
x??

---
#### Rules of Interpretation
Background context explaining that courts use various rules to interpret contracts, known collectively as the "rules of interpretation." These rules include giving words their plain and normal meaning, interpreting every part of a contract so it carries out its general purpose, and considering circumstances under which the contract was made.
:p List three primary rules of interpretation according to Laurence P. Simpson's Contracts (West, 1965).
??x
The three primary rules of interpretation are:
1. Words are to be given their plain and normal meaning, except where usage may vary the normal meaning of words, technical words are to be given their technical meanings, or words will be given the meaning which best effectuates the intention of the parties.
2. Every part of a contract is to be interpreted so as to carry out its general purpose.
3. The circumstances under which the contract was made may always be shown.
x??

---
#### Secondary Rules of Interpretation
Background context explaining that if primary rules do not clarify the meaning of the contract, secondary rules are used. These include correcting obvious mistakes in writing, grammar, or punctuation; restricting the meaning of general words by more specific descriptions; and giving valid interpretations to contracts with multiple meanings.
:p Name three secondary rules of interpretation for when primary rules fail to clarify a contract's meaning.
??x
Three secondary rules of interpretation for when primary rules fail to clarify a contract's meaning are:
1. Obvious mistakes of writing, grammar or punctuation will be corrected.
2. The meaning of general words or terms will be restricted by more specific descriptions of the subject matter or terms of performance.
3. A contract susceptible of two meanings will be given the meaning which will render it valid.
x??

---
#### Interpretation Against the Party Using the Words
Background context explaining that a key principle in interpretation is to construe words most strongly against the party using them, especially when there are ambiguities or doubts about their meaning.
:p Explain how courts interpret terms most strongly against the party who used them.
??x
Courts often interpret terms most strongly against the party who used them, particularly when dealing with ambiguities or doubts. This means that if a contract term is ambiguous, the court will favor an interpretation that makes it more reasonable and less likely to result in a contract that is unenforceable.

Example: If a business contract uses the term "prompt payment," which could be interpreted differently by different parties, the court might interpret this term most strongly against the party who drafted the term. This ensures that the interpretation is fair and reasonable for all parties involved.
x??

---

---
#### Expressio Unius Est Exclusionis Alterius
Background context explaining the concept: The Latin phrase "expressio unius est exclusio alterius" means that when a specific item is listed, it excludes other items not mentioned. This rule helps in interpreting contracts where multiple items are listed but one is excluded.
:p According to expressio unius est exclusionis, if a contract lists several items and does not include another, what can we infer about the excluded item?
??x
We can infer that the parties probably intended the excluded item to be excluded. This means that the non-inclusion of an item in the list implies it is not part of the agreement.
The reasoning behind this rule is based on the idea that listing specific items usually indicates a deliberate exclusion of others, unless there is strong evidence suggesting otherwise.
```java
// Example usage in Java code:
public boolean isExcluded(String item, String[] listedItems) {
    for (String listItem : listedItems) {
        if (item.equals(listItem)) {
            return false; // Item is not excluded as it's explicitly listed
        }
    }
    return true; // Item is inferred to be excluded as it was not in the list.
}
```
x??
---

---
#### Ejusdem Generis
Background context explaining the concept: "Ejusdem generis" means "of the same kind," and this rule applies when a general term is used with specific terms. The general term usually applies only to items of the same kind as those listed, unless there's clear evidence that it should apply more broadly.
:p According to ejusdem generis, if a contract lists several specific events but does not include another event, can this exclusion be used to argue against its inclusion?
??x
Yes, according to ejusdem generis, the fact that certain events are listed and others are not suggests an intent to exclude those other events. For instance, in the example provided, the force majeure clause lists "fire, flood, earthquake, or hurricane," but does not include "tornado." This exclusion can be used to argue against the inclusion of a tornado as an excusing event.
The reasoning here is that the specific terms (fire, flood, etc.) are meant to cover similar types of events, and since "tornado" is not listed, it is likely excluded from coverage under this clause.
```java
// Example usage in Java code:
public boolean isExcluded(String event, String[] specificEvents) {
    for (String specificEvent : specificEvents) {
        if (event.equals(specificEvent)) {
            return true; // Event is of the same kind as those listed and not excluded.
        }
    }
    return false; // Event is likely to be excluded as it's not in the list of similar events.
}
```
x??
---

---
#### Force Majeure Clause Example
Background context explaining the concept: A force majeure clause excuses non-performance due to certain specified events. The example provided illustrates how contract language can be ambiguous and how rules of interpretation like expressio unius est exclusionis and ejusdem generis help in resolving such ambiguities.
:p In the given example, what would happen if a tornado hit the seller's plant?
??x
According to expressio unius est exclusionis, the fact that fire, flood, earthquake, and hurricane are listed but not tornado suggests an intent to exclude tornado damage. Therefore, the buyer would likely argue that the clause does not excuse performance due to a tornado.
If the seller tries to include "including but not limited to" in the list of events, ejusdem generis might apply, meaning only natural disasters like those explicitly listed (fire, flood, earthquake, hurricane) would be excused. In this case, a strike is likely not considered a similar event and thus would also not excuse performance.
```java
// Example usage in Java code:
public boolean isExcusableEvent(String event, String[] specificEvents) {
    for (String specificEvent : specificEvents) {
        if (event.equals(specificEvent)) {
            return true; // Event is explicitly listed as excusable.
        }
    }
    return false; // Event must be of the same kind and not specifically excluded.
}
```
x??
---

---
#### Redrafting the Force Majeure Clause
Background context explaining the concept: To avoid ambiguity, the seller redrafted the force majeure clause to include "including but not limited to" to clarify that other events could be excused. The example illustrates how different contract drafting techniques can affect the interpretation of clauses.
:p What is an effective way for the seller to redraft the force majeure clause to avoid ambiguity?
??x
An effective way for the seller to redraft the force majeure clause would be by using "including but not limited to" and clearly specifying the types of events that are excusable. For example:
```
Seller’s performance is excused in the event seller is unable to perform because of fire, flood, earthquake, or hurricane, or other excusing event whether of the type enumerated or not.
```
This drafting technique leaves room for interpretation while still providing clarity. It explicitly states that other events can be considered as long as they are similar in nature to those listed.
```java
// Example usage in Java code:
public boolean isExcusableEvent(String event, String[] specificEvents) {
    if (Arrays.asList(specificEvents).contains(event)) {
        return true; // Event is explicitly listed and excusable.
    } else {
        for (String specificEvent : specificEvents) {
            if (event.equals(specificEvent)) {
                return false; // Event must be of the same kind and not specifically excluded.
            }
        }
        return true; // Event can be considered as other types are also included.
    }
}
```
x??
---

#### Contra Proferentem Rule
This rule of interpretation is commonly used by courts to resolve disputes, particularly when dealing with contracts drafted by large entities like banks and insurance companies. The rule essentially means "against the one who offered it," implying that any ambiguity in a contract should be construed against the party that drafted it.
:p What does the contra proferentem rule entail?
??x
The contra proferentem rule states that any ambiguities in a contract should be interpreted in favor of the party that did not draft the contract. This is often used to protect smaller parties from overly complex or one-sided contracts crafted by larger, more powerful entities.
```java
// Example scenario
class ContractInterpretation {
    public static void applyContraProferentem(String draftedBy) {
        if ("bank".equals(draftedBy)) {
            System.out.println("Ambiguities should be construed against the bank.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("The contract terms are clear for all parties involved.");
        }
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Looking Beyond Contract Language
Courts often go beyond the literal wording of a contract to understand the true intentions of the parties. This involves examining past experiences and practices that may not be explicitly stated in the contract.
:p How do courts examine past experiences beyond the contract language?
??x
Courts consider various factors like course of performance, course of dealing, and usage of trade to interpret ambiguous terms. These factors help clarify what the parties likely intended when they drafted the agreement.
```java
// Example scenario
class ContractAnalysis {
    public static void analyzeExperience(String experienceType) {
        if ("courseOfPerformance".equals(experienceType)) {
            System.out.println("Examining the established pattern of performance between parties.");
        } else if ("courseOfDealing".equals(experienceType)) {
            System.out.println("Considering past business practices and conduct.");
        } else if ("usageOfTrade".equals(experienceType)) {
            System.out.println("Reviewing industry-specific practices and customary meanings of terms.");
        }
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Course of Performance
Course of performance refers to a pattern of behavior established under a single contract where one party acts in a certain way, and the other party accepts or does not object within a reasonable time. This pattern sets the standard for future performance.
:p What is course of performance?
??x
Course of performance is when one party consistently performs a task according to an unspoken agreement, and the other party acknowledges this performance without objection. Courts may use this pattern as evidence that the parties intended certain terms or meanings within their contract.
```java
// Example scenario
class ContractPattern {
    public static void determinePerformance(String pastActions) {
        if ("weekly trash pickup".equals(pastActions)) {
            System.out.println("The course of performance establishes a weekly service frequency.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("No clear pattern detected from the past actions.");
        }
    }
}
```
x??

---

---
#### Course of Dealing
Background context: A pattern established through performance of a series of previous contracts between the same parties. When interpreting contract language, courts may look at the parties' transaction history to determine meaning.

:p What is course of dealing?
??x
Course of dealing refers to a pattern established by repeated actions and performances in previous transactions between the same parties. It can influence the interpretation of terms in current or future contracts if one party has consistently performed certain actions, leading the other party to rely on these practices as part of their agreement.

Example: A business receives trash pickup once a week for some time without objection from the service provider. The service provider reasonably concludes that this term has been established and looks at the course of dealing to interpret the contract.
x??

---
#### Trade Usage
Background context: Language with special meanings in specific industries or customs prevailing within those industries. If parties engage in disputes over terms, courts often look to trade usage for determination.

:p What is trade usage?
??x
Trade usage refers to industry-specific language and practices that are widely known and understood by insiders of that particular trade. Even new entrants can be bound by these usages if they have knowledge or it is commonly known within the trade.

Example: A buyer purchases chicken from a seller, expecting broilers but receiving stewing chickens instead. The court would examine whether "chicken" in this industry typically means broilers based on common understanding and usage.
x??

---
#### Objective Understanding vs. Subjective Knowledge
Background context: Contract law often assumes that reasonable people in similar positions would know certain facts, even if the actual parties did not know them.

:p What does objective understanding imply?
??x
Objective understanding implies that a court may determine what is known based on what a reasonable person in the same position would know. Even if one party was unaware of something, they might still be held accountable due to this reasonable person standard.

Example: If someone renovates their basement and buys two-by-fours expecting them to measure 2 x 4 inches, but finds out that trade usage allows for a deviation in size, the court would likely rule based on what a reasonable contractor would know about the industry standards.
x??

---

---
#### Trade Knowledge Imputation
Background context: The passage discusses how knowledge of trade practices is often assumed even when someone claims they are not part of a particular trade. This can affect outcomes if you're involved in business dealings with such parties.

:p What does it mean for "knowledge to be imputed" in the context of trade?
??x
When a person engages in business activities related to a specific trade, their knowledge and understanding of that trade's norms are assumed even if they claim not to be part of the trade. This can impact legal outcomes and business decisions.
x??

---
#### Asking Dumb Questions for Business Understanding
Background context: The passage suggests that asking questions is an effective way to understand your client’s business practices, especially in trades where such knowledge is deeply ingrained.

:p Why might it be beneficial to ask a lot of "dumb" questions when dealing with clients?
??x
Asking many questions can help you gain a deeper understanding of the client's business practices and norms. This is particularly useful in industries where trade usages are deeply embedded but not always explicitly stated in contracts.
x??

---
#### Hierarchy of Meaning in Contracts (UCC § 1-303)
Background context: The passage outlines a hierarchy for resolving conflicts in contract terms, emphasizing the order in which different types of evidence should be considered.

:p What is the correct order to resolve conflicts according to the UCC § 1-303 hierarchy?
??x
The hierarchy of meaning, as per UCC § 1-303, is:
1. Express term (most weight)
2. Course of performance
3. Course of dealing
4. Trade usage (least weight)

This order establishes which type of evidence should govern when conflicts arise.
x??

---
#### Example Conflict Resolution Using Hierarchy
Background context: The passage provides an example where the hierarchy helps resolve a conflict in a therapeutic service contract.

:p How would you apply the hierarchy to resolve a dispute over therapy session billing?
??x
To resolve the dispute:
1. Check if there is an express term defining "therapeutic hour" in the contract.
2. If not, look at the course of performance; did both parties agree on a 45-minute session duration?
3. Consider any previous interactions (course of dealing) for consistency.
4. Finally, refer to trade usage or industry standards if no other terms are clear.

In this case, the therapist’s explanation of "therapeutic hour" as 45 minutes would likely prevail since it aligns with the course of performance and may not be explicitly defined in an express term.
x??

---
#### Express Terms Preempting Other Evidence
Background context: The passage explains that express terms are given priority over other forms of evidence when interpreting contract terms.

:p How does an express term affect the interpretation of a contract?
??x
An express term in a contract trumps any other form of evidence (course of performance, course of dealing, or trade usage). If there's a clear and specific agreement within the contract, this should be followed unless it leads to a waiver through subsequent actions.

Example:
If a contract states "In this contract, 'chicken' means broilers," then the supplier must provide broilers regardless of previous practices or industry standards.
x??

---
#### Waiver Through Course of Performance
Background context: The passage mentions that course of performance can lead to a waiver if the parties act contrary to their express terms.

:p What is meant by "waiver" in the context of contract interpretation?
??x
A waiver occurs when one party's actions, despite an expressed term, indicate they no longer enforce or adhere to that term. This can invalidate the express term and lead to a different interpretation based on subsequent behavior.

Example:
If a contract states broilers must be supplied but over time, the supplier starts sending stewers, this could be seen as a waiver of the express term "broilers."
x??

---
#### Course of Dealing
Background context: The passage explains that previous transactions between parties can influence contract interpretation when there is no express term.

:p How does course of dealing affect contract interpretation?
??x
Course of dealing involves examining past interactions between the same parties to understand implicit agreements or practices. If an express term is not clear, courts may look at prior dealings to determine what terms are implied and thus have legal weight.

Example:
If a seller has historically supplied broilers despite no explicit definition in contracts, this past behavior could influence the interpretation of future contracts.
x??

---
#### Trade Usage as Last Resort
Background context: The passage suggests that trade usage is considered only after all other forms of evidence fail to resolve a conflict.

:p When would trade usage come into play during contract interpretation?
??x
Trade usage comes into play when there are no express terms, course of performance, or course of dealing. It represents the industry standard and provides a fallback for resolving ambiguities in contract terms.
x??

---

#### Course of Performance vs. Course of Dealing and Trade Usage

**Background Context:**
In contract law, the hierarchy of interpreting terms includes course of performance, course of dealing, trade usage, and finally, express terms. The course of performance refers to repeated actions by one party that the other accepts without objection. Course of dealing involves a pattern of behavior over multiple transactions between the same parties. Trade usage is a generally accepted practice in a particular industry.

**Explanation:**
If a seller initially supplies broilers but later supplies stewers, and the buyer accepts these until protesting, course of performance trumps course of dealing or trade usage because acceptance without objection establishes that "chicken" means broilers.

:p How does the hierarchy determine which interpretation takes precedence in a contract dispute?
??x
The hierarchy determines that course of performance trumps both course of dealing and trade usage when one party accepts repeated actions from the other. In this case, if the buyer accepted stewers until protesting, the seller would lose because the buyer's acceptance established through course of performance that "chicken" means broilers.
x??

---

#### Waiver in Contract Interpretation

**Background Context:**
A waiver can occur when one party allows the other to believe a term is not enforceable. This can temporarily change the hierarchy, placing course of performance above express terms.

**Explanation:**
If a car buyer pays late for six months but makes payments on time thereafter, and the seller repossesses the vehicle after declaring full payment due, the seller has waived its right to strictly enforce the first term by accepting delayed payments. The waiver can be undone if the seller informs the buyer that it will no longer accept late payments.

:p Can you provide an example of a situation where a seller's course of performance results in a waiver?
??x
Yes, consider a scenario where a car buyer promises to make 24 payments on the first of every month. The contract states if they don't pay, the seller can declare full payment due and repossess the vehicle. Over six months, the buyer makes payments late but still receives the car each month without consequences. In the seventh month, when the buyer doesn’t make the payment by the 1st, the seller repossesses the car. Here, the repeated acceptance of late payments (course of performance) led the buyer to believe that making payments a few days late is acceptable, thus waiving the express term requiring on-time payments.

x??

---

#### Objective Meaning from Outside the Contract

**Background Context:**
Objective meaning can be defined by reasonable people or by what parties have manifested in their communications. This objective meaning helps clarify ambiguous contract terms and can supersede other interpretations if relevant evidence is provided.

**Explanation:**
For example, if a stock trader uses coded language where "buy" means to sell and vice versa, this secret code would be considered an objective meaning that both parties have manifested through prior discussions and agreements. 

:p How does the concept of objective meaning help in resolving ambiguous contract terms?
??x
Objective meaning helps clarify ambiguities by considering reasonable definitions or meanings that are external to the contract but understood by the parties involved. For instance, if a stock trader uses "buy" to mean sell due to internal policies, this coded language is an objective meaning that can supersede any ambiguity in the written contract.

x??

---

#### Examples of Objective Meaning

**Background Context:**
Objective meanings can be derived from dictionary definitions or trade usages, as well as communications and agreements between parties. These external factors help clarify ambiguous terms and establish a clear understanding of what was intended by the parties.

**Explanation:**
For example, if a stock trader fears overhearing during phone calls and agrees with his broker to use "buy" for selling and "sell" for buying in coded language, this secret code is an objective meaning that both parties have manifested. This can be crucial when determining whether the trader's action constitutes a breach of contract.

:p What kind of examples demonstrate the concept of objective meanings?
??x
Examples include dictionary definitions or trade usages as reasonable people's interpretations and discussions between parties before signing contracts, such as earlier drafts or pre-contract negotiations. For instance, if a stock trader and his broker agree to use "buy" for selling and "sell" for buying, this secret code is an objective meaning that both have manifested.

x??

---

#### Determining Ambiguity and Meaning Through Context
Background context: Courts sometimes consider evidence beyond the contract language to determine whether certain terms are ambiguous. This includes looking at the overall context, including testimony from parties involved or their attorneys.

:p Can courts use subjective evidence to determine a term's meaning?
??x
Courts may consider subjective evidence such as testimony from the parties and their lawyers to understand what the actual parties intended when they drafted the contract. However, most courts reject this approach because it can be easily manipulated after the fact.
x??

---

#### Resolving Ambiguities in Contract Language
Background context: If a court determines that certain language is ambiguous, it may use various methods to resolve the ambiguity, such as rules of interpretation or other objective evidence.

:p How might a court resolve an obvious ambiguity in contract language?
??x
A court could resolve an obvious ambiguity by using interpretative rules. For instance, if a contract states "130,000 dollars" when it should be written out, the court might rule that words override numbers to reflect a more considered intent.

```java

#### Handling Misunderstandings in Contract Formation
Background context: If courts cannot resolve an ambiguity, the parties may have a misunderstanding, meaning they did not form a clear mutual agreement. This can render a contract void.

:p What does it mean if parties have a "misunderstanding"?
??x
A "misunderstanding" occurs when a contract has two possible meanings and neither party can prove which one was intended by both or what reasonable parties would’ve intended. In the Raffles v. Wichelhaus case, this happened because the buyer thought of the October Peerless ship while the seller considered the December Peerless.

```java
// Example logic for checking mutual understanding
boolean hasContract = false;

String buyerIntendedShip = "October Peerless";
String sellerIntendedShip = "December Peerless";

if (buyerAwareOfSellerIntent(buyerIntendedShip, sellerIntendedShip) &&
    sellerAwareOfBuyerIntent(buyerIntendedShip, sellerIntendedShip)) {
    hasContract = true;
} else if (!buyerAwareOfSellerIntent(buyerIntendedShip, sellerIntendedShip) &&
           !sellerAwareOfBuyerIntent(buyerIntendedShip, sellerIntendedShip)) {
    hasContract = false; // No contract formed
}

boolean buyerAwareOfSellerIntent(String buyerShip, String sellerShip) {
    // Logic to check if the buyer knew of the seller's intention
    return true;
}

boolean sellerAwareOfBuyerIntent(String buyerShip, String sellerShip) {
    // Logic to check if the seller knew of the buyer's intention
    return false; // Example scenario where no awareness exists
}
```

#### Resolving Ambiguities Through Subjective Evidence in Frigaliment Case
Background context: In the Frigaliment case, a court considered various types of evidence to resolve an ambiguity about what "chicken" meant for contract purposes.

:p How did Judge Friendly use evidence to resolve the ambiguity in the Frigaliment case?
??x
Judge Friendly reviewed multiple forms of evidence including the contract itself, government regulations referenced in it, and price indications. He also considered negotiation documents, the course of performance, and trade usage to determine if "chicken" meant broilers or stewing chicken. Ultimately, he concluded that the plaintiff did not prove that its interpretation was more reasonable.

```java
// Example logic for resolving ambiguities
String[] possibleInterpretations = {"stewing chicken", "broilers"};
boolean isBroilerMeaningReasonable = false;

for (String interpretation : possibleInterpretations) {
    if (isPlausibleBroiler(interpretation)) {
        isBroilerMeaningReasonable = true;
        break;
    }
}

// Function to check plausibility
boolean isPlausibleBroiler(String interpretation) {
    // Logic to verify the interpretation's plausibility based on evidence
    return false; // Example scenario where it's not plausible
}
```
