# Flashcards: Contract-Law-For-Dummies_processed (Part 15)

**Starting Chapter:** Working with and around the Default Rules

---

#### Default Rules and Freedom of Contract
Default rules are provided by federal and state statutes, including the UCC for goods contracts. The common law is also a source, found in the Restatement of Contracts. These default rules can be overridden if the parties agree otherwise.
:p What does "unless otherwise agreed" mean in the context of default rules?
??x
This phrase indicates that unless the parties include a term addressing a specific issue, the Code supplies a default rule. However, the UCC states in § 1-302(c) that even with such phrases, other provisions can still be varied by agreement.
??x

---

#### Identifying Default Rules
When determining if a rule is a default or immutable rule, you need to look for specific language like "unless otherwise agreed." The presence of this phrase indicates that the parties have the freedom to override the rule through their own terms.
:p How can one determine whether a rule is a default or an immutable rule?
??x
To determine if a rule is a default or immutable, consult the statute or common law for phrases like "unless otherwise agreed." If such language exists, it suggests that the parties can negotiate and agree on alternative terms. However, even in the absence of explicit language allowing variation, parties still might have freedom to negotiate.
??x

---

#### Freedom of Contract and Risk Shifting
Freedom of contract allows parties to set their own terms within legal limits. This flexibility extends to overriding default rules and shifting risks such as loss of goods or changes in price to the other party through negotiation.
:p How can a merchant seller override the UCC's warranty of merchantability?
??x
A merchant seller can override the UCC’s warranty of merchantability by adding clear and conspicuous language to the contract. For example, the seller might include a clause stating that no such warranties are given, shifting the risk to the buyer.
??x

---

#### Risk Shifting in Delivery Terms
The default rule for delivery place under the UCC can be changed if agreed upon by the parties. The North Carolina version of UCC § 2-308(a) provides that unless otherwise agreed, the seller’s place of business is the place for delivery.
:p How does a buyer change the default rule governing the place of delivery?
??x
A buyer can suggest a provision like: "The seller shall deliver the goods to the buyer at the buyer's address in Boston at the seller's sole expense." This shifts the risk from the buyer to the seller by requiring the seller to bear the cost and arrange for delivery.
??x

---

#### Shifting Risk of Goods Loss
Risk can be shifted by negotiating terms that require the other party to manage or bear certain risks. For example, a buyer carrying the risk that goods' prices may fall can negotiate with the seller to shift this risk back to the seller.
:p How might a buyer shift the risk of price changes after signing a contract?
??x
A buyer can include a clause in the contract stating that if the market price falls, the seller will absorb any losses rather than the buyer. This negotiation aims to protect the buyer from potential financial harm due to falling prices post-contract.
??x

---

#### Using Freedom of Contract Strategically
Parties can use freedom of contract to strategically change default rules and shift risks by including specific terms that suit their interests. For instance, a seller might agree to deliver goods at the buyer's expense instead of the standard delivery from the seller’s place of business.
:p How can parties strategically use freedom of contract?
??x
Parties can strategically use freedom of contract by including specific terms that override default rules and shift risks. This involves careful negotiation where one party agrees to bear certain costs or risks in exchange for benefits, such as cost savings or reduced liability.
??x

#### Express Warranty
Background context: An express warranty is a specific type of warranty that explicitly states an affirmation of fact or promise made by the seller to the buyer. This statement becomes part of the basis of the bargain, meaning it is relied upon during the transaction.

:p What is an express warranty in contract law?
??x
An express warranty is an affirmation of fact or promise made by the seller to the buyer that relates to the goods and becomes part of the basis of the bargain. It can be a factual statement or a promise about the quality, condition, or performance of the goods.
??x

---

#### Basis of the Bargain in Express Warranty
Background context: The term "basis of the bargain" refers to the understanding that the express warranty must become part of the deal for it to be enforceable. There are two main interpretations:
1. The buyer relied on the warranty as part of the deal.
2. The timing interpretation, which uses the parol evidence rule.

:p How is the basis of the bargain determined in an express warranty?
??x
The determination of whether the express warranty forms part of the basis of the bargain can be interpreted in two ways:
1. **Relyance Theory**: If the buyer knew they were getting something different from what was expressly promised, then the buyer didn't get the warranty.
2. **Timing Theory**: The warranty is part of the basis of the bargain if it's included in the final written agreement after all verbal promises are documented.

This interpretation can vary depending on jurisdiction and specific circumstances.
??x

---

#### Implied Warranty of Title
Background context: An implied warranty of title or against infringement is a default provision that arises when goods are transferred. The law assumes certain warranties unless explicitly waived by the buyer.

:p What does the implied warranty of title cover?
??x
The implied warranty of title, under UCC § 2-312(1), guarantees that the seller owns the item and has the right to transfer it without any liens or encumbrances. It also covers claims of infringement from third parties.

For example, if a car is sold with an undisclosed lien, the buyer can claim breach of warranty against the seller.
??x

---

#### Implied Warranty Against Infringement
Background context: This warranty ensures that the goods are not infringing on any intellectual property rights. It applies to various types of goods and is increasingly important in the age of smart devices.

:p What does the implied warranty against infringement cover?
??x
The implied warranty against infringement, under UCC § 2-312(2), guarantees that the seller has delivered goods free from third-party intellectual property claims. This includes software, inventions, literary and artistic works, and designs used in commerce.

For example, if a car's architecture infringes on someone else's patent, each buyer down the distribution chain can claim breach of warranty against the previous seller.
??x

---

#### Implied Warranty of Merchantability
Background context: The implied warranty of merchantability applies to merchants who deal with a certain kind of product. It states that goods are fit for ordinary purposes.

:p What is the implied warranty of merchantability?
??x
The implied warranty of merchantability, under UCC § 2-314, guarantees that goods are fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used. This means the goods perform their intended functions properly and reliably.

For example, a car dealer selling you a car gives you an implied warranty that it is fit to be driven.
??x

---

#### Implied Warranty of Merchantability in Used Cars
Background context: The implied warranty of merchantability applies to merchants dealing with specific types of products. For used cars, the seller warrants only that the car is fit for ordinary use given its condition.

:p Does the implied warranty of merchantability apply to used-car dealers?
??x
Yes, used-car dealers are considered merchants and give an implied warranty of merchantability. However, this applies specifically to the condition and fitness of a particular used car. For example, if you buy a 100,000-mile car, the dealer warrants only that it is as fit as any other 100,000-mile car.

If there's an issue with a component like the transmission failing, the buyer must prove that the ordinary transmission should last longer.

Each flashcard covers one key concept from the provided text and includes context, explanations, and relevant examples.

---
#### Implied Warranty of Merchantability

The implied warranty of merchantability is a default rule under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) that states goods must be fit for their ordinary purposes. However, it does not cover all possible uses; for specific uses, an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose may apply.

:p What is the difference between the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose?
??x
The implied warranty of merchantability ensures that goods are suitable for general use or ordinary purposes. In contrast, the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose covers goods when they are selected by the seller based on the buyer’s specific needs.

For example:
- If you buy a car from a dealer, it is expected to be fit for regular driving (implied warranty of merchantability).
- If you specifically ask for footwear suitable for climbing Mount Everest, and the dealer provides hiking boots, this would cover an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose.
x??

---
#### Shifting Risk by Disclaiming or Limiting Warranties

Under UCC rules, parties can contract around default warranties. This is often done through disclaimers or limitations of remedies. Disclaimers must be specific and conspicuous to ensure the buyer fully understands they are waiving their rights.

:p What must a disclaimer include to be considered valid under UCC?
??x
A disclaimer must specifically address the implied warranty, use clear language, and be presented in a manner that is noticeable by a reasonable person. For example:
- To disclaim the warranty of merchantability: "NO WARRANTIES, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, ARE INCLUDED."
- Using “AS IS” terms can also work as it communicates to buyers they are not receiving any warranty.

For example:
```java
public class Contract {
    public void disclaimer() {
        System.out.println("There are no warranties including but not limited to the implied warranty of merchantability.");
    }
}
```
x??

---
#### Specific and Conspicuous Disclaimer Language

To make sure buyers understand they are waiving their rights, disclaimers must be clear, specific, and prominently displayed in contracts. For instance, a disclaimer should use language like "Seller gives no warranty that he has good title to the goods sold" or "NO WARRANTIES ARE INCLUDED."

:p How can a seller effectively disclaim an implied warranty of merchantability?
??x
A seller can disclaim the implied warranty of merchantability by using specific and clear language. For example:
- "NO WARRANTIES, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, ARE INCLUDED."
This ensures that the buyer is fully aware they are not receiving any warranties.

For instance:
```java
public class SalesContract {
    public void disclaimer() {
        System.out.println("NO WARRANTIES, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, ARE INCLUDED.");
    }
}
```
x??

---
#### Using “AS IS” to Disclaim Warranties

The term "AS IS" is a shorthand for disclaiming warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. While it can be effective, the UCC generally assumes that buyers understand they are not receiving any warranty when this term is used.

:p What does the term “AS IS” imply in a sales contract?
??x
The term "AS IS" implies that the seller is not providing any implied warranties, including merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. It communicates to the buyer that they are accepting the goods as they are without any guarantees or assurances.

For example:
```java
public class SalesContract {
    public void disclaimer() {
        System.out.println("The car is sold AS IS with no warranty of any kind.");
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Disclaiming Implied Warranties
Background context: In contract law, sellers often disclaim warranties to reduce their risk. The text describes how a particular language uses specific terms and is conspicuous, thus allowing them to disclaim implied warranties.

:p How does the provided example demonstrate disclaiming an implied warranty?
??x
The example shows a disclaimer that includes using the word "merchantability," making it conspicuous, and explicitly stating that all other warranties are also disclaimed. This approach ensures that both the implied warranty of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose are waived.
x??

---

#### Limiting Breach Remedies
Background context: Sellers often limit the remedies available to buyers in case of breach. The text discusses various ways sellers can cap the damages or restrict the duration of warranties.

:p What are some common strategies used by sellers to limit breach remedies?
??x
Sellers commonly limit breach remedies through several methods:
1. Limiting recovery for direct damage (loss of the product) to the purchase price, repair costs, or cost of parts.
2. Disclaiming liability for consequential damages, such as loss of income or personal injury due to defects.
3. Limiting the duration of warranty coverage.

For example, a seller might state: "The buyer’s remedies are limited to repair or replacement within one year from purchase."

```java
// Example Code Snippet
public class Warranty {
    public void limitRemedies() {
        // Cap recovery for direct damage to the product itself
        int maxRecovery = Math.min(purchasePrice, repairCosts);
        
        // Disclaim liability for consequential damages
        boolean isLiabilityDisclaimed = true;
        
        // Limit warranty duration to one year
        int warrantyDuration = 12; // in months
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Consequential Damages and Remedies
Background context: The text explains that sellers often disclaim liability for consequential damages, which are losses arising from the primary breach. It also mentions specific sections of law providing additional recourse.

:p How do sellers typically handle consequential damages?
??x
Sellers frequently disclaim liability for consequential damages by explicitly stating such in their contracts. For instance: "The seller is not liable for any consequential or incidental damages, including but not limited to loss of profits, data, or use."

For example:
```java
// Example Code Snippet
public class Warranty {
    public void limitConsequentialDamages() {
        boolean disclaimLiability = true; // Disclaim liability for consequential damages
        
        if (!disclaimLiability) {
            System.out.println("Sellers are responsible for all losses, including consequential ones.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Buyers agree that sellers will not be liable for any consequential damages.");
        }
    }
}
```

#### Warranty Disclaimers and Express Warranties
Background context: The text discusses the common strategies used by sellers to disclaim warranties while still offering some form of express warranty. This balance helps in reducing risk exposure.

:p What are the typical components included when drafting a disclaimer?
??x
When drafting a disclaimer, most sellers include:
1. A statement disclaiming implied warranties.
2. An express warranty with a specified scope and duration.
3. Limitation of remedies for breach of warranty.
4. Description of possible remedies (replacement or repair).
5. Determination of who will decide the remedy.

For example:
```java
// Example Code Snippet
public class WarrantyDisclaimer {
    public void createDisclaimer() {
        String disclaimer = "Disclaiming Implied Warranties: The seller disclaims all implied warranties, including those of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.";
        
        String expressWarranty = "Express Warranty: The product will be repaired or replaced within one year from the date of sale if it proves to be defective in material or workmanship upon examination by the Manufacturer.";
        
        String limitationOfRemedies = "Limitation of Remedies: The buyer’s remedies are limited to repair, replacement, or a refund.";
    }
}
```
x??

#### Exclusive and Limited Remedy Provisions
Background context: The text mentions that if an exclusive remedy fails its essential purpose, other remedies may be available. This is particularly relevant in cases where multiple attempts at repair have not resolved the issue.

:p How does North Carolina's Section 2-719 address failure of an exclusive remedy?
??x
North Carolina's Section 2-719 addresses situations where an exclusive or limited remedy has failed to achieve its essential purpose. The section states that "where circumstances cause an exclusive or limited remedy to fail of its essential purpose, remedy may be had as provided in this act."

For example:
```java
// Example Code Snippet
public class ExclusiveRemedy {
    public void handleFailedRemedy() {
        boolean isRepairAttemptSuccessful = false; // Assume multiple repair attempts failed
        
        if (!isRepairAttemptSuccessful) {
            System.out.println("Since the exclusive remedy has failed, other remedies under the act may be available.");
            
            // Other remedies such as revocation of acceptance or return of goods
        }
    }
}
```
x??

#### Manufacturer's Warranty and Disclaimer
The manufacturer provides a warranty that allows for repair or credit for defective parts, but no other warranties are provided. This includes express warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The manufacturer retains significant discretion over how to resolve defects.

:p What does the manufacturer’s warranty allow in terms of resolving part defects?
??x
The manufacturer can either repair the part or provide credit for it. The manufacturer has the option to choose between these actions.
x??

---

#### Statutory Regulation of Disclaimers
Federal and state statutes regulate certain transactions, requiring specific terms in contracts or forbidding certain terms. For example, some states have regulations regarding contracts with dance studios and gyms.

:p What types of transactions are regulated by federal and state statutes?
??x
Transactions such as those involving dance studios and gyms are regulated by federal and state statutes. These regulations can require specific terms to be included in the contract or prevent certain terms from being included.
x??

#### Case Study: Murray v. Holiday Rambler, Inc.
In this case, a family purchased a motor home with an "express repair or replace" warranty, a disclaimer of implied warranties, and an exclusion of consequential damages. Despite numerous problems, the company always fixed the issues but they kept recurring.

:p What were the key terms in the contract between Murray and Holiday Rambler?
??x
The key terms included an express “repair or replace” warranty, a disclaimer of implied warranties, and an exclusion of consequential damages.
x??

---

#### Effectiveness of Warranty Disclaimers
Courts have ruled that disclaimers can fail if they do not adequately serve the purpose for which the contract was entered into. In Murray v. Holiday Rambler, Inc., even though the company fixed the issues, it failed to provide a usable product.

:p How did the court determine whether the warranty disclaimer effectively served its purpose?
??x
The court determined that the remedy of repair or replace failed to serve its essential purpose by providing the Murrays with a decent motor home. Therefore, all remedies became available.
x??

---

#### Consequential Damages and Remedy Failure
Courts can find that disclaimers of consequential damages fall when the limited remedy provided also fails. In Murray v. Holiday Rambler, Inc., the court ruled that since the limited repair or replace remedy failed to provide a usable product, consequential damages were recoverable.

:p Did the courts allow recovery for consequential damages in this case?
??x
Yes, the courts allowed recovery for consequential damages because the limited remedy of repair or replace did not adequately serve its purpose. However, the Murray family could only prove $500 in consequential damages due to poor record-keeping.
x??

---

#### Attorney's Fees and Default Rules
In contract disputes, the default rule is that each side pays their own legal fees. This means that even if a party wins the case, they may not recover attorney’s fees.

:p What is the default rule regarding attorney’s fees in contract disputes?
??x
The default rule is that each side pays its own legal fees. This means that regardless of who wins the case, typically neither party can recover their attorney's fees from the other.
x??

---

#### Lemon Laws and Consumer Protection
Background context explaining that lemon laws are designed to protect consumers when a new vehicle has a major defect that cannot be fixed within a reasonable time. These laws provide for quicker resolutions through nonbinding arbitration and attorney’s fees if successful.

:p What is a lemon law?
??x
Lemon laws are statutes that offer protection to consumers who purchase a "lemon" (a vehicle with a significant defect) when standard warranties do not suffice. They typically provide a speedier resolution through nonbinding arbitration and may include provisions for attorney's fees.
x??

---

#### Large Vehicles and Lemon Laws
Background context on the specific application of lemon laws, noting that they generally do not cover large vehicles such as mobile homes.

:p Do lemon laws apply to all types of vehicles?
??x
No, lemon laws typically apply only to new automobiles. They do not usually cover other large vehicles like mobile homes.
x??

---

#### Warranty Disclaimers and UCC § 2-719(2)
Background context on the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) § 2-719(2), which is often applied in automobile warranty cases, providing protection when a limited remedy fails to resolve the issue.

:p What does UCC § 2-719(2) cover?
??x
UCC § 2-719(2) covers situations where a seller has failed to repair a product within a reasonable time. If a dealer is unable to fix a major problem after multiple attempts or numerous days in the shop, the manufacturer must buy back the car.
x??

---

#### FTC Used Car Regulation Rule
Background context on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulation that requires used car dealers to clearly display warranty terms and conditions.

:p What does the FTC Used Car Regulation require?
??x
The FTC Used Car Regulation requires used car dealers to place a sticker on the side window of the car, stating either "AS IS — NO WARRANTY" or specifying the exact warranty terms. This ensures that consumers are informed about the warranty status of the vehicle.
x??

---

#### Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act
Background context on the federal act aimed at improving warranties by requiring clear disclosure of terms and conditions without interfering with freedom of contract.

:p What is the purpose of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act?
??x
The purpose of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act is to improve consumer protection by ensuring that sellers clearly disclose warranty terms. The act encourages manufacturers to compete in offering better warranties through full disclosure, while still respecting the principle of freedom of contract.
