**Starting Chapter:** Determining Whether the Offeror Can Back Out Revoking the Offer

---

#### Bait and Switch in Advertising
Background context: Stores can sometimes use bait-and-switch tactics, where they advertise an incredible deal to attract customers but offer a less attractive alternative. Contract law does not provide solutions for such practices, but many jurisdictions have enacted consumer protection laws that make this illegal.

:p What is the bait-and-switch tactic in advertising?
??x
The bait-and-switch tactic involves advertising an incredibly enticing offer (the "bait") and then offering something of lesser value or quality when customers try to take advantage of the deal ("the switch"). This practice can mislead consumers and is often regulated by consumer protection laws.

#### Multiple Acceptances and Limited Supplies
Background context: When there are limited quantities of an item, it's important to determine how multiple acceptances should be handled. Typically, the first person who accepts gets the item. If not addressed, this could lead to disputes among offerees.

:p How can a store handle situations where multiple friends accept an offer for one widget?
??x
When there are limited supplies and multiple people accept an offer, it's common practice to give the item to the first person who accepted. For example, if you have six friends over and say, "I'll sell this widget for $10," and five of them accept, the remaining four might file a breach of contract claim. A fair way to resolve this is by giving the widget to the first friend who accepts the offer.
x??

---
#### Clear and Definite Offers
Background context: An advertisement can be considered an offer if it's clear and definite, meaning only acceptance is required for the contract to form. Circulars are particularly vulnerable because recipients might not know that others have received the same circular.

:p Can a letter sent to multiple friends be considered an offer?
??x
Yes, sending a letter to multiple friends offering to sell a widget for $10 can constitute an offer if each recipient doesn't know they received the same offer. If so, you could be bound by multiple acceptances since each friend might reasonably believe that the widget is available exclusively to them.
x??

---
#### Reasonable Period for Offer
Background context: An offer remains open for a reasonable period of time. The length can vary based on facts and circumstances. For example, an offer made at 3 PM on Friday could be expected to remain open until Monday morning if it relates to non-volatile markets.

:p What factors determine the reasonableness of an offer's duration?
??x
The reasonableness of an offer's duration is determined by considering the facts and circumstances. For instance, an offer to sell shares of stock on a Friday might be expected to remain open until Monday morning, as values don't change over weekends. However, if made during trading hours, it might only be valid for seconds.
x??

---
#### Revoking Offers
Background context: An offeror can revoke their offer at any time before acceptance, but certain conditions allow the offer to remain open indefinitely.

:p How can an offeror keep an offer open indefinitely?
??x
An offeror can keep an offer open by making a gift promise to do so. For example, if you say, "I'll sell you 1,000 shares of Megalomart stock for $20 a share, and this offer is open until Tuesday noon," but then revoke it before the deadline, your revocation would be valid because you made a gift promise.
x??

---
#### Option Contracts
Background context: An option contract allows an offer to remain open by making an enforceable promise in exchange for something from the other party. This could include money or any other consideration.

:p What is an option contract?
??x
An option contract is a type of agreement where one party promises to keep an offer open, and the other party pays (or gives) something in return. For example, if you say, "I'll sell you 1,000 shares of Megalomart stock for $20 a share," and someone agrees to pay a dollar to keep that offer open until Tuesday noon, you both have an enforceable option contract.
x??

---
#### Statutes Creating Options
Background context: Some states or legislatures may enact statutes that allow offers to remain open without the need for consideration. The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) § 2-205 is one such example.

:p What does UCC § 2-205 state?
??x
UCC § 2-205 states that an offer by a merchant to buy or sell goods in a signed writing, which by its terms gives assurance that it will be held open, cannot be revoked for lack of consideration during the time stated or if no time is stated, for a reasonable time. However, such periods may not exceed three months.
x??

---
#### Revocation Exceptions
Background context: There are specific conditions under which an offeror can't revoke their offer.

:p What exceptions exist to revoking offers?
??x
Exceptions to revoking offers include:
1. **Option Contracts:** An enforceable promise is required to keep the offer open.
2. **Statutes Creating Options:** Statutes like UCC § 2-205 allow offers to remain open without consideration under certain conditions.
3. **Reliance on the Offer:** If an offeree has relied on the offer, revocation might be prohibited.

For example, if a merchant makes a firm offer in writing and the statute allows it, the offer cannot be revoked for lack of consideration during the stated period or within three months.
x??

#### General Rule of Reliance on Offers
Background context explaining that generally, an offeree should not rely on an offer. If they do and it is revoked before acceptance, they may be out of luck unless specific provisions are made.

:p What does this section imply about the general rules regarding reliance on offers?
??x
In this situation, if you rely on my offer to buy 10,000 pens for $1 each by renting space for a pen store and buying supplies, and I revoke the offer before you accept it, then you are out of luck unless we agreed beforehand that the offer is irrevocable or you obtained an option.

```java
// Example of revocation scenario in Java
public class OfferRevocation {
    public void checkOfferStatus(String offer) {
        if (!offer.isAccepted()) {
            System.out.println("Offer has been revoked.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Offer accepted, proceed with plans.");
        }
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Drennan v. Star Paving Case
Background context explaining the specific case where an exception to the general rule was created due to circumstances that made it reasonable for the offeree to rely on the offer.

:p What is the key takeaway from the Drennan v. Star Paving case?
??x
The court in Drennan v. Star Paving created an exception to the general rule where a contractor (Drennan) was awarded a job and had to wait for another contractor’s bid before accepting his own offer, thus making it reasonable for him to rely on Star Paving’s bid until he could confirm both offers.

```java
// Pseudocode for handling Drennan v. Star Paving scenario
public class ContractExceptionHandling {
    public boolean isOfferValid(String firstBid, String secondBid) {
        // Logic to check if the offer from Star Paving is still valid
        return !firstBid.isRevoked() && !secondBid.isAccepted();
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Mirror-Image Rule for Acceptance
Background context explaining that acceptance must be the mirror image of the original offer, matching it in every respect. Any deviation results in a rejection and counteroffer.

:p What does the mirror-image rule imply about accepting an offer?
??x
The mirror-image rule means that when you accept an offer, your acceptance must exactly match all terms stated by the offeror, including price, quantity, delivery dates, etc., without any modifications. If there is even a minor difference, it constitutes a counteroffer and not an acceptance.

```java
// Pseudocode for checking if acceptance matches the offer
public class AcceptanceChecker {
    public boolean isAcceptanceValid(String offerDetails, String acceptance) {
        return offerDetails.equals(acceptance);
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Inquiries as a Form of Acceptance
Background context explaining that making an inquiry can maintain the power to accept. An offeree can make inquiries without immediately accepting or rejecting.

:p How does an inquiry affect the validity of acceptance under the mirror-image rule?
??x
An inquiry is a way for the offeree to request clarification or negotiate terms without formally accepting or rejecting the offer. This preserves the original offer and allows further negotiation. For example, if you make a counteroffer by inquiring "While keeping your offer open, may I inquire as to whether you would consider selling at $19 per share?" this keeps the original offer alive for further discussion.

```java
// Pseudocode for handling inquiries
public class OfferInquiry {
    public void handleInquiry(String originalOffer, String inquiry) {
        // Logic to keep the original offer open while processing an inquiry
        System.out.println("Handling inquiry: " + inquiry);
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Mailbox Rule
The mailbox rule is a fundamental principle in contract law that determines when an acceptance becomes effective. According to this rule, acceptance is considered effective once it leaves the offeree’s hands, not upon receipt by the offeror.
:p What does the mailbox rule state about the timing of acceptance becoming effective?
??x
Under the mailbox rule, acceptance is effective when it is dispatched from the offeree's hands, meaning that the moment the acceptance is placed in the mail or otherwise sent out, a contract is formed if the offer is still open. This prevents the offeree from gaining an unfair advantage by accepting and then having additional time to reconsider.
```java
// Example: Acceptance via Mail
public class ContractExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Date offerDate = new Date(); // Offer presented on a certain date
        Date dispatchDate = new Date(offerDate.getTime() + 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000); // Dispatched the next day
        
        if (dispatchDate.after(offerDate)) {
            System.out.println("Acceptance is effective as of " + dispatchDate);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Offer has expired.");
        }
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Looking at Various Forms of Acceptance
When making an offer, the offeror can specify the method of acceptance. The offeree must use a medium that’s at least as good as the one offered by the offeror. This ensures fairness and clarity in communication.
:p What determines the form of acceptance according to the offeror?
??x
The manner of acceptance is determined by the offeror, who can specify how the offeree should accept the offer. If no specific method is stated, a reasonable method is presumed. The offeree must use this specified medium or one that is equivalent or better.
```java
// Example: Specifying Acceptance Method
public class OfferAcceptance {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String preferredMedium = "email";
        
        if ("email".equals(preferredMedium)) {
            System.out.println("Offeree can accept via email, postal mail, or fax.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Specified medium not supported.");
        }
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Promissory Acceptance (Bilateral Contracts)
In a bilateral contract, the acceptance is typically in the form of a promise. The offeror seeks a return promise that confirms the deal and secures both parties’ commitments.
:p What is a promissory acceptance in the context of bilateral contracts?
??x
A promissory acceptance in a bilateral contract involves the offeree making a return promise to seal the deal, ensuring mutual obligations between the parties. For example, if Joe offers to buy Mary’s bicycle for $200 and Mary responds with "It's a deal," both parties are bound by their promises.
```java
// Example: Promissory Acceptance in Java
public class BilateralContract {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String offer = "I'll buy your bicycle for $200";
        String acceptance = "It's a deal";
        
        if (acceptance.equals("It's a deal")) {
            System.out.println("Bilateral contract formed.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("No agreement reached.");
        }
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Performance-Based Acceptance (Unilateral Contracts)
In unilateral contracts, acceptance is through performance rather than a promise. The offeror specifies an action the offeree must take to accept the offer.
:p What characterizes a unilateral contract?
??x
A unilateral contract requires acceptance by performance, where the offeree must complete a specified task to fulfill the terms of the offer. For example, in a reward situation, completing a task (like solving a problem) triggers the offeror’s obligation to pay the reward. This type of contract is one-sided because it focuses on the completion of an action rather than mutual promises.
```java
// Example: Unilateral Contract in Java
public class UnilateralOffer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        boolean taskCompleted = true;
        
        if (taskCompleted) {
            System.out.println("Reward is due.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Task not completed; no reward.");
        }
    }
}
```
x??

---

---
#### Unilateral Contract vs Bilateral Contract
Background context: A unilateral contract involves an offer to pay a reward for the completion of an act, while a bilateral contract is one where both parties exchange promises. The primary difference lies in how acceptance and revocation are handled.

:p What is the key distinction between a unilateral contract and a bilateral contract?
??x
In a unilateral contract, the offeror makes a promise contingent upon someone completing a specific act (e.g., finding a lost dog). Acceptance occurs only through performance. In contrast, a bilateral contract involves mutual promises (e.g., you agree to paint my garage for $2,000). Here, acceptance can be by either promise or performance.

The key difference is in the revocability and enforceability of the offer before acceptance:
- Unilateral: The offeror can revoke the offer at any time before completion.
- Bilateral: Once a bilateral contract is formed (whether through promise or performance), both parties are bound, even if partial performance has occurred.

Explanation: This distinction affects the offeror's ability to change their mind and the obligations of the offeree once they start performing.
x??

---
#### Option Contract in Unilateral Contracts
Background context: An option contract is created when an offeree begins performing under a unilateral contract that cannot be revoked after the offeree has started performance. The UCC provides rules for such situations to protect the offeree from unexpected revocation.

:p How does an option contract work in the context of unilateral contracts?
??x
In a unilateral contract, if the offeree starts performance and the offeror either knows about it or reasonably should know that performance has begun, then an option contract is formed. This means the offeror can't revoke the offer during the reasonable time required to complete the performance.

Explanation: The primary rule states that once an offeree begins performance in a unilateral contract, the offeror cannot revoke the offer without the risk of being legally bound to fulfill it if the performance is completed.
x??

---
#### Acceptance by Promise or Performance
Background context: In some cases, an offer can be accepted either by a promise (bilateral contract) or through performance alone. The key point is that once an offeree begins performing, both parties are bound as if they had formed a bilateral contract.

:p What happens when an offer can be accepted by either promise or performance?
??x
When an offer can be accepted by either promise or performance, and the offeree starts to perform, both parties are immediately bound as if they had entered into a bilateral contract. This means that even if acceptance was originally by performance alone, starting the act of performing binds both parties.

Explanation: The moment you begin performing (e.g., painting the garage), a contract is formed, making it binding on both sides. If one party stops before completing the task, they would be in breach of the agreement.
x??

---
#### UCC § 2-206 and Contracts to be Accepted by Performance
Background context: The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) provides additional protections for offerees who start performance in certain circumstances. Specifically, UCC § 2-206(1)(b) states that if a contract can only be accepted through performance, the offeror cannot revoke after the offeree has started.

:p How does UCC § 2-206 affect unilateral contracts?
??x
UCC § 2-206(1)(b) creates an option contract in cases where acceptance is by performance alone. If the offeree begins performing, the offeror can't revoke the offer even if they have started the act of performance.

Explanation: This rule ensures that once you start painting (in our example), the offeror cannot cancel the agreement without potential legal consequences. The offeror must honor the contract as long as it is completed.
x??

---

#### Merchant Acceptance by Promise or Performance
Background context explaining that under certain circumstances, a merchant may accept an offer through promise or performance. This includes shipping goods that are different from what was originally ordered (nonconforming goods). The common-law mirror-image rule states that acceptance must exactly match the offer, but this statute provides exceptions.
:p What is the difference between traditional acceptance and acceptance by performance?
??x
In traditional acceptance under common law, an acceptance must mirror the terms of the original offer exactly. However, under UCC § 2-207, a merchant can accept through promise or performance. Performance includes shipping nonconforming goods if the seller notifies the buyer that this is being done as an accommodation.
x??

---

#### Ship Nonconforming Goods
Background context on how, in certain cases, sending nonconforming goods can be considered acceptance of the offer. This is permissible only if the seller promptly informs the buyer that the shipment is provided as an accommodation.
:p Can a seller ship nonconforming goods and still form a contract?
??x
Yes, a seller can ship nonconforming goods to form a contract if they notify the buyer that this shipment is being offered as an accommodation. This notification prevents the shipment from constituting a breach of contract but instead acts as a counteroffer.
```java
// Example scenario in Java
public class ContractForm {
    public void handleNonConformingGoods(String typeA, String typeB) {
        if (isTypeBOutofStock()) {
            notifyBuyerAccommodation(typeB);
            shipGoods(typeB);
        } else {
            shipGoods(typeA);
        }
    }

    private boolean isTypeBOutofStock() {
        // Logic to check stock availability
        return true;
    }

    private void notifyBuyerAccommodation(String type) {
        System.out.println("Sending " + type + " as an accommodation.");
    }

    private void shipGoods(String type) {
        System.out.println("Shipping " + type + " goods.");
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Common-Law Mirror-Image Rule
Background context on the common-law rule that requires acceptance to be a mirror image of the offer. If there are any differences, it is treated as a counteroffer.
:p How does the UCC change the traditional acceptance requirement?
??x
The UCC § 2-207 changes the traditional common-law mirror-image rule by allowing performance (shipping goods) or promise to ship goods as an acceptance even if they do not exactly match the original offer. This means that nonconforming goods can be shipped and accepted, provided the seller notifies the buyer of the accommodation.
x??

---

#### Battle of the Forms
Background context on how parties often use form contracts in business transactions without fully reading or understanding them. This can lead to disputes where each party claims their own terms are governing.
:p How does UCC § 2-207 handle disputes arising from "battle of the forms"?
??x
UCC § 2-207 addresses disputes by allowing acceptance through performance (shipping goods) or promise to ship even if these do not exactly match the original offer. This means that if a form contract is used, the terms can be considered accepted as long as they are performed upon, provided the seller notifies the buyer of any nonconforming goods.

These flashcards cover key concepts in the text and provide relevant explanations and examples to aid understanding.

#### The Mirror-Image Rule and Offeree's Form
Background context explaining that under common law, if an offeree’s form differs from the offeror’s terms (even by stating additional or different terms), it is considered a counteroffer. This means acceptance of such a form does not create a contract unless both parties agree to modify their terms.
:p What does the mirror-image rule state regarding the offeree's form?
??x
The mirror-image rule states that an offeree’s form with additional or different terms is treated as a counteroffer, and thus does not qualify as acceptance under common law. It only qualifies if both parties agree on the new terms.
x??

---

#### UCC § 2-207: Additional Terms in Acceptance of Confirmation
Background context explaining how the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) modified the common-law rules by introducing Section 2-207 to provide a more balanced approach when additional or different terms are included in an acceptance.
:p What does UCC § 2-207 address?
??x
UCC § 2-207 addresses situations where an offeree includes additional or different terms in its acceptance, providing a mechanism for these terms to become part of the contract unless explicitly rejected by the offeror or deemed material alterations.
x??

---

#### Conditions on Acceptance (UCC § 2-207(1))
Background context explaining that under UCC § 2-207, an offeree’s acceptance with additional or different terms can still be effective if it is definite and seasonable. However, the acceptance cannot be expressly conditional on assent to these new terms.
:p How does UCC § 2-207(1) affect the effectiveness of acceptance?
??x
UCC § 2-207(1) states that an offeree’s acceptance with additional or different terms can still operate as acceptance if it is definite and seasonable, unless it is expressly conditional on assent to those new terms.
x??

---

#### Construction of Additional Terms (UCC § 2-207(2))
Background context explaining the process by which UCC § 2-207(2) addresses additional terms. The section states that these terms are proposals for addition to the contract and become part of it under certain conditions.
:p What does UCC § 2-207(2) say about additional terms?
??x
UCC § 2-207(2) states that any additional or different terms in an offeree’s acceptance are treated as proposals for addition to the contract. Between merchants, these terms become part of the contract unless (a) the offer expressly limits acceptance to its own terms; (b) they materially alter it; or (c) notification of objection has been given within a reasonable time.
x??

---

#### Merchant Contract Formation Under UCC § 2-207(3)
Background context explaining that UCC § 2-207(3) provides for contract formation even if the written terms do not fully establish a contract, as long as there is conduct by both parties recognizing its existence.
:p How does UCC § 2-207(3) affect merchant contract formation?
??x
UCC § 2-207(3) states that a contract for sale can be formed even if the written terms do not fully establish it, as long as there is conduct by both parties recognizing its existence. The terms of such a contract consist of those on which the writings agree, plus any supplementary terms incorporated under other UCC provisions.
x??

---

#### Complexity of UCC § 2-207
Background context explaining that despite attempts to clarify, UCC § 2-207 remains complex due to poor drafting and ambiguous language, making it a challenging topic in contract law.
:p Why is UCC § 2-207 considered difficult?
??x
UCC § 2-207 is considered difficult because of its poorly drafted nature. It leaves many ambiguities unanswered and can lead to confusion over what happens if certain conditions are met or not. Its complexity makes it a challenging topic for both scholars and practitioners.
x??

---

---
#### Boilerplate Terms and UCC § 2-207
Background context: The parties usually read the main terms of an agreement, but often skip over "boilerplate" terms that are standard clauses. When an offeree includes additional or different terms in its response to an offer (often in a boilerplate form), it can be treated as acceptance under UCC § 2-207(1) unless the additional or different terms are specifically rejected.
:p What does "additional or different terms" typically refer to in the context of UCC § 2-207?
??x
The offeree's inclusion of boilerplate terms that differ from those in the original offer. For example, if the buyer’s form includes terms like “If you don’t agree to these additional terms, we have no deal,” this conditional acceptance is not an agreement until both parties expressly agree.
x??

---
#### Conditional Acceptance and Counteroffers
Background context: When a response contains additional or different terms, it can be treated as acceptance under UCC § 2-207(1) unless the offeree makes its acceptance conditional. If the offeree's form clearly states that there is no deal without agreement on these terms, this form is not an acceptance.
:p What happens if the offeree’s response to an offer contains additional or different terms and specifies a condition for acceptance?
??x
The offeree must explicitly state, “If you don’t agree to my terms, we don’t have a deal.” If such language is clear, the offeror can walk away without being in breach. However, because the offeror rarely reads these forms, they often proceed with the transaction.
x??

---
#### Mutual Assent and Contract Formation
Background context: If the offeror files the form and proceeds with the transaction, even though there was no mutual agreement on the terms, UCC § 2-207(3) allows for a contract to be formed through their actions. The key is that both parties must act as if they have a contract.
:p How does subsection (3) of UCC § 2-207 address situations where there is no mutual agreement on terms?
??x
Subsection (3) states that even if the offeror makes acceptance conditional, and the parties proceed with the transaction, this can constitute mutual assent. The specific terms then follow from the Code or common law default rules.
x??

---
#### Matching Terms and Default Rules
Background context: When both parties' forms agree on a term, it is part of their agreement. However, if they don't agree, the contradictory provisions are not automatically part of the contract. The Code or common law fills in these gaps to determine the terms of the agreement.
:p What happens when the offeror and offeree's forms contain conflicting terms?
??x
If the terms don’t match, look for a default rule from the Code (such as § 2-615 on Excuse by Failure of Presupposed Conditions) to determine which events would excuse performance. For instance, if one form states "performance is excused only if A, B, and C occur" and another says "only if D, E, or F," the Code fills in the gap.
x??

---

#### Additional Terms vs. Different Terms

When an offeree responds to an offer with their own form, UCC § 2-207 provides guidance on how additional or different terms affect contract formation.

:p What is the difference between "additional" and "different" terms in the context of contract formation?
??x
Additional terms are those that address a topic not covered by the original offer. For example, if an offeror’s form is silent on dispute resolution, adding “all disputes go to arbitration” would be considered an additional term.

Different terms involve addressing the same topic but in a different way. For instance, specifying that arbitration should take place in New York instead of New Jersey when both parties mention arbitration as a means of resolving disputes.
x??

---

#### Consequences of Additional Terms

According to UCC § 2-207(2), additional terms “are to be construed as proposals for addition to the contract.” Between merchants, if neither party rejects these terms or objects within a reasonable time after receiving notice, the terms become part of the contract.

:p What happens when an offeree’s proposed term is considered "additional" under UCC § 2-207(2)?
??x
When a term is additional and both parties are merchants, it becomes part of the contract unless explicitly rejected. The offeror has three opportunities to reject these terms:

1. By expressly limiting acceptance to the terms of the offer.
2. By giving notice of objection within a reasonable time after receiving notice of the proposed terms.
3. By materially altering the original terms in such a way that it results in surprise or hardship if incorporated without express awareness by the other party.

The term "materially alter" means that the additional terms would result in surprise or hardship for one party if not expressed with explicit awareness from both parties involved.
x??

---

#### Examples of Rejection of Additional Terms

UCC § 2-207(2)(a) through (c) outline different ways to reject additional terms. For example, an offeror can explicitly limit acceptance in the contract or notify the offeree within a reasonable time that they reject the proposed term.

:p How does an offeror use UCC § 2-207(2)(b) to reject additional terms?
??x
Under UCC § 2-207(2)(b), if the additional terms materially alter the original contract, they are rejected. This means that any changes that would result in surprise or hardship for one party without express awareness from both parties should be considered a material alteration.

For example, an offeror’s form might state, “All disputes go to arbitration in New York,” while the offeree proposes, “All disputes go to arbitration in New Jersey.” If these terms are accepted and incorporated into the contract, it could result in surprise or hardship for one party if not explicitly agreed upon. Therefore, such a term would be rejected under this provision.
x??

---

#### Material Alteration of Terms

UCC § 2-207(2)(b) specifies that additional terms may be rejected “if they materially alter the contract.” The Code does not define "materially alter," but Official Comment 4 provides guidance: terms result in surprise or hardship if incorporated without express awareness by the other party.

:p What constitutes a material alteration under UCC § 2-207(2)(b)?
??x
A term is considered to materially alter the contract if its incorporation would result in surprise or hardship for one party without their explicit awareness. For instance, an offeree’s additional term that significantly changes the dispute resolution method (e.g., changing from arbitration in New York to New Jersey) could be rejected as it might cause surprise and hardship to the offeror.

This provision ensures that only terms that both parties are aware of and agree upon become part of the contract.
x??

---

#### Knockout Rule
Background context: The knockout rule is a common approach used by courts to resolve differences between terms proposed by the offeror and offeree. According to this rule, both differing terms are removed or "knocked out," and the default rule from the Code or common law is read in.
:p What does the knockout rule do when there are conflicting terms?
??x
The knockout rule involves removing both differing terms from consideration and inserting the default rule as defined by the applicable legal code or common law. For example, if an offeror's term states "All disputes go to arbitration in New York," and the offeree’s form states "All disputes go to arbitration in New Jersey," the court would strike both terms and revert to a common-law rule that typically involves taking the dispute to court.
```java
public class Example {
    public void resolveDispute(String offerorTerm, String offereeTerm) {
        // Default: If both terms differ, use default rule from Code or common law

#### Offeror's Term Prevails
Background context: Some courts use the rule that the offeror’s term prevails when there are differing terms. This means that if an offeror's form states a particular term, and the offeree's form includes a different but non-conflicting term, the offeror’s term is upheld in the contract.
:p According to this rule, what happens when the offeror's term differs from the offeree's?
??x
According to the "offeror's term prevails" rule, if the offeror's form states a particular term (e.g., "All disputes go to arbitration in New York"), and the offeree's form includes a different but non-conflicting term (e.g., "All disputes go to arbitration in New Jersey"), the offeror’s term is upheld. The contract will adopt the term stated by the offeror.
```java
public class Example {
    public void applyOfferorTerm(String offerorTerm, String offereeTerm) {
        if (offerorTerm != null && offereeTerm == null || !offereeTerm.equals(offerorTerm)) {
            System.out.println("Contract term is: " + offerorTerm);
        } else {
            System.out.println(offereeTerm);
        }
    }
}
```

#### Additional Terms
Background context: When the offeree proposes additional terms, those terms are handled according to subsection (2)(a) of the relevant legal provision. If the offeror objects to an additional term proposed by the offeree, that term is rejected and does not become part of the contract.
:p How do courts handle additional terms proposed by the offeree?
??x
Courts handle additional terms proposed by the offeree according to subsection (2)(a) by rejecting any additional term that the offeror objects to. If an offeree proposes a new term, and the offeror does not agree or include it in its form, that additional term is excluded from the contract.
```java
public class Example {
    public void handleAdditionalTerms(String additionalTerm) {
        if (additionalTerm == null || !additionalTerm.equals("approved by offeror")) {
            System.out.println(additionalTerm + " rejected");
        } else {
            System.out.println(additionalTerm);
        }
    }
}
```

#### Material Alteration
Background context: The material alteration rule, as mentioned in (2)(b), states that only an offeree’s term that does not differ substantially from the offeror’s term can become part of the contract. Courts use this rule to determine whether a difference between terms is significant enough to be considered "material."
:p How do courts determine if a term is material under the material alteration rule?
??x
Courts determine if a term is material under the material alteration rule by assessing whether the difference between the offeror’s and offeree's terms is substantial. A difference that poses no hardship or significant inconvenience to either party would likely be considered immaterial, whereas differences causing significant difficulty are deemed material.
```java
public class Example {
    public boolean isMaterial(String offerorTerm, String offereeTerm) {
        if (offerorTerm == null || offerorTerm.equals(offereeTerm)) {
            return false;
        } else {
            // Check for substantial difference
            if (!offereeTerm.contains(offerorTerm.substring(0, 5))) { // Example check
                return true;
            }
            return false;
        }
    }
}
```
