#### ALCOA v. Essex Case Overview
Background context: In the case of ALCOA v. Essex, ALCOA promised to covert ore into aluminum from 1967 to 1983 and developed a formula for pricing based on the Wholesale Price Index (WPI). The contract was supposed to cover increases in production costs.

:p What happened with the contract during the long-term agreement?
??x
ALCOA faced financial difficulties because the WPI did not account for the dramatic increase in electricity prices due to the OPEC oil embargo. This led to a significant loss of $75 million, prompting ALCOA to seek relief from its duty to perform under the contract.

#### Force Majeure Clause
Background context: A force majeure clause is an agreement that excuses performance if certain events beyond the control of the parties occur.

:p What does a solid force majeure clause typically include?
??x
A solid force majeure clause should include:
- A list of common excusing events, such as natural disasters.
- Language stating that the listed events "include but are not limited to" those specific types.
- Language covering events that may be outside the class of enumerated events (e.g., strikes).
- A price escalator provision to address changes in input costs.

Example:
```
Seller’s performance is discharged if seller is unable to perform in whole or substantial part because of events beyond its control, including but not limited to fire, flood, hurricane, or tornado, whether the event is of the same class as the enumerated events or not.
```

x??

---

#### Price Escalator Clause
Background context: A price escalator clause allows parties to adjust terms if there are significant changes in input costs.

:p What is a common element of a price-escalator clause?
??x
A common element is language that permits adjustment of the contract's terms due to severe hardship resulting from increased costs of inputs, without an advantage to the other party. For example:

```
If a new situation beyond the reasonable control of either party arises during the term of this agreement, and if that situation results in a severe hardship to one party without an advantage to the other party, then the parties shall promptly consult to seek a mutually acceptable agreement that deals with the situation.
```

x??

---

#### Hell or High Water Clause
Background context: A "hell or high water" clause ensures that performance is not excused even if unanticipated events arise.

:p What does a "hell or high water" clause provide for?
??x
A "hell or high water" clause provides that the party must perform regardless of unexpected circumstances, including injuries or other impediments. For example:
```
If an athlete or entertainer has a lot of bargaining power, she can get a term in the contract that provides that in addition to her nonperformance being excused if she is unable to perform (for example, because of an injury), she still gets paid in the event of that injury.
```

#### Defining Conditions in Legal Terms
Background context: The text introduces conditions as a crucial element in contract law, explaining how they determine when performance becomes due. A condition is defined as "an event, not certain to occur, which must occur, unless its non-occurrence is excused, before performance under a contract becomes due." Conditions can be either express or implied.

:p What are conditions in legal terms?
??x
Conditions in legal terms refer to events that are not certain to occur but must happen for performance under a contract to become due. They come in two forms: express and implied.
x??

---

#### Express vs. Implied Conditions
Background context: The text differentiates between express and implied conditions, noting that while both types of conditions can influence the terms of a contract, they are distinct.

:p How do express and implied conditions differ?
??x
Express conditions are explicitly stated in the contract by the parties involved. They are clear and direct, leaving no room for ambiguity. Implied conditions, on the other hand, are not written but inferred from the context or nature of the agreement. For instance, a condition might be implied that one party will perform their obligations only if the other performs theirs.
x??

---

#### Promises vs. Conditions
Background context: The text explains how to distinguish between promises and conditions within a contract, emphasizing the practical implications for breach.

:p What is the difference between a promise and a condition in a contract?
??x
In a contract, a **promise** is a commitment by one party to do or refrain from doing something. It's an unconditional commitment that must be fulfilled regardless of whether other conditions are met. A **condition**, however, is an event that must occur before some performance becomes due, and it’s not certain to happen.

Example:
- In the contract where you agree to pay $400 for a Ted Williams autographed baseball if the Red Sox win the World Series, the condition is winning the World Series. The promise is your commitment to pay upon delivery.
x??

---

#### Practical Implications of Breach
Background context: The text discusses how breach of conditions versus promises affects contractual rights and obligations.

:p What are the practical implications of breaching a condition or a promise?
??x
Breach of **promise** gives the non-breaching party only the right to seek damages. However, if a **promissory condition** is breached, it excuses the non-breaching party's performance (since the condition was not met) and allows them to sue for damages due to the breach.

Example:
- If in the Ted Williams autographed baseball contract, you refuse to pay after receiving the ball because the Red Sox didn’t win the World Series, your refusal is a breach of promise. You can still seek damages from me.
- Conversely, if I refuse to deliver the ball and sue for the extra cost incurred by paying more elsewhere, my non-performance due to the condition not being met allows me to sue you for damages.
x??

---

#### Dependent vs. Independent Promises
Background context: The text explains the distinction between dependent and independent promises within a contract, highlighting how courts often view these differently.

:p What is the difference between dependent and independent promises in contracts?
??x
In contracts, **dependent promises** are conditional on the performance of another promise. They require an event to occur before they must be performed. In contrast, **independent promises** are unconditional and do not depend on any other event occurring.

Example:
- In a separation agreement where a husband promises to pay $100 per week child support, and the wife promises to give him weekend visitation with the kids, these promises are considered independent. The court rules that even if the husband fails to pay, he still has to allow the wife visitation.

#### Leveraging Conditions for Performance
Background context: The text explores how using conditions can provide leverage in contract performance.

:p How can you use conditions to secure performance from the other party?
??x
You can make your client’s performance conditional on the other party's performance. This strategy gives you leverage because if they fail to perform their part, you are not obligated to perform yours until they do. However, extending credit or allowing delayed payment turns this condition into an unconditional promise.

Example:
- In the Ted Williams autographed baseball contract with a 30-day payment period contingent on winning the World Series, your performance is conditional on my delivering the ball. If I fail to deliver, you can refuse to pay.
x??

---
#### Express vs. Implied Conditions
Express conditions are those explicitly stated in a contract, such as "I'll sell you my Ted Williams baseball for $400 if the Red Sox win the World Series this year." Implied conditions are not directly stated but are inferred by courts.

:p What is an example of an express condition?
??x
An example of an express condition is: "I’ll sell you my Ted Williams baseball for $400 if the Red Sox win the World Series this year."
x??

---
#### Express vs. Implied Conditions (continued)
Express conditions are directly stated in the contract, while implied conditions are inferred by courts under the rule of constructive conditions of exchange. For instance, if two parties agree to a deal without specifying that performance is conditional on the other's performance, a court may imply such a condition based on mutual obligations.

:p What is an example of an implied condition?
??x
An example of an implied condition is: Each party’s performance in the contract is impliedly conditional on the other party’s performance. For instance, if Party A agrees to sell goods to Party B, both parties’ obligations are impliedly contingent upon each other's actions.
x??

---
#### Express Conditions and Good-Faith Duties
Express conditions can protect a party from unforeseen circumstances that prevent performance. If a condition is within the control of one party, they have a good-faith duty to ensure its occurrence.

:p What happens if a party has some control over the conditional event in an express condition?
??x
If a party has control over the conditional event in an express condition, they have a good-faith duty to see that it occurs and not to prevent its occurrence. For example, a homebuyer who makes an offer conditional on securing a mortgage loan must make a good-faith effort to secure the loan.
x??

---
#### Implied Conditions by Courts
Courts often find implied conditions in contracts where neither party explicitly states the performance is conditional upon the other’s action. The rule of constructive conditions of exchange implies that each party’s obligations are contingent on the other's actions.

:p How do courts determine if an implied condition exists?
??x
Courts determine if an implied condition exists by finding that each party’s obligation to perform is impliedly conditional on the other party’s performance. This means that a contract will be interpreted as having both parties’ performances mutually dependent, even if not explicitly stated.
x??

---
#### Homebuyer Example with Express Conditions
Homebuyers often use express conditions in their purchase offers, such as making an offer contingent on selling their own house by a certain date or securing a mortgage loan. If the specified event doesn’t happen, the buyer isn't required to perform and isn't in breach for nonperformance.

:p What is an example of using express conditions in a homebuying scenario?
??x
An example of using express conditions in a homebuying scenario: A homebuyer can make an offer conditional on selling their own house by a certain date or securing a mortgage loan. If the specified event (selling the house, getting the loan) doesn’t happen, the buyer isn't required to perform and isn't in breach for nonperformance.
x??

---
#### Implied Conditions in Home Buying
Implied conditions can be found where neither party explicitly states that performance is conditional on the other’s actions. For example, if a homebuyer makes an offer without specifying any contingencies but later claims they're not obligated because of unforeseen circumstances, courts may imply a mutual dependency.

:p How do implied conditions affect a home buyer's obligations?
??x
Implied conditions affect a home buyer's obligations by making their performance contingent on the seller's actions. If the buyer makes an offer without specifying any contingencies but later claims they're not obligated because of unforeseen circumstances, courts may imply that both parties' performances are mutually dependent.
x??

#### Implied Conditions of Exchange

Background context explaining the concept. The text discusses how a change in law after 1775 allowed for implied conditions in contracts, where if one party refuses to perform their part of the agreement, the other party is excused from performing theirs.

The core idea here is that an implied condition can be applied when one party breaches the contract by not paying as promised. This means you can refuse to give the baseball if the $400 payment isn't made, or vice versa.

:p What are implied conditions of exchange?
??x
Implied conditions of exchange refer to situations where a court will infer that both parties have implicitly agreed on certain terms in addition to what is explicitly stated in the contract. For instance, in the scenario provided, if you refuse to pay $400 for the baseball, I can refuse to give you the baseball because this condition was implied as a practical necessity.

This rule allows for flexibility in contracts where explicit conditions might not be included but are necessary for the fair execution of the agreement.
x??

---

#### Conditions Precedent

Background context explaining the concept. The text defines conditions precedent as an event that must occur before some promise has to be performed, such as agreeing to sell a baseball only if the Red Sox win the World Series.

:p What is a condition precedent?
??x
A condition precedent is an event that must occur before some promise has to be performed. In other words, it’s a requirement that needs to be met first for the contract to move forward. For example, in the scenario provided, selling you the baseball would only proceed if the Red Sox win the World Series.

This means the seller can refuse to sell the baseball until the Red Sox have won the series.
x??

---

#### Conditions Concurrent

Background context explaining the concept. The text defines conditions concurrent as an event that must occur at the same time as a promise has to be performed, such as selling the baseball and receiving $400 simultaneously.

:p What is a condition concurrent?
??x
A condition concurrent is an event that must occur at the same time as another party’s performance. In simpler terms, both parties’ obligations are tied together—performance by one party is conditional on the other party’s performance happening concurrently.

For example, in the given scenario, you would not pay $400 until I give you the baseball.
x??

---

#### Conditions Subsequent

Background context explaining the concept. The text explains that a condition subsequent is an event that discharges a duty to perform a promise once it occurs. Examples include insurance policies where a duty to pay might be discharged if certain events happen, like failure to notify within 30 days after a loss.

:p What is a condition subsequent?
??x
A condition subsequent is an event that, upon its occurrence, discharges or excuses the duty of one party to perform their promise. For example, in insurance contracts, the insurer’s duty to pay for losses might be discharged if the insured doesn’t provide notice within 30 days after suffering a loss.

In essence, once this condition occurs, the obligation to perform is no longer required.
x??

---

#### Civil Procedure and Burdens of Proof

Background context explaining the concept. The text explains that in civil procedure, there's a difference in who bears the burden of proof for conditions precedent versus conditions subsequent. Plaintiffs must prove conditions precedent, while defendants bear the burden of proving conditions subsequent.

:p How do burdens of proof differ between conditions precedent and conditions subsequent?
??x
In civil procedure, the burden of proof differs between conditions precedent and conditions subsequent:

- **Condition Precedent:** The plaintiff (the party seeking to enforce their promise) must prove that the condition precedent has been met. If they fail to do so, the defendant can refuse performance.
  
- **Condition Subsequent:** The defendant (the party against whom a claim is being made) must prove that the condition subsequent has occurred. If this burden is not met by the defendant, the plaintiff can seek enforcement of their promise.

This distinction ensures fairness in litigation by placing the burden on each party to prove what they need to.

#### Conditions Precedent and Subsequent in Insurance Contracts
Background context: In insurance contracts, conditions precedent and subsequent can significantly affect the insurer's duty to pay. These conditions outline what must happen before or after an event for the insurer to fulfill its obligations.

Explanation: For purposes of contract law, these distinctions aren't important because both types of conditions result in similar outcomes—the insured cannot recover if they fail to meet the specified condition.

:p In insurance contracts, how do conditions precedent and subsequent affect recovery?
??x
Conditions precedent require a specific event to occur before the insurer’s duty to pay arises. Conditions subsequent can terminate the insurer's duty to pay based on an event that occurs after the obligation is due.

In both cases, failure by the insured to meet these conditions means they cannot recover from the insurer.
x??

---
#### Obligations in Pleading Conditions
Background context: When pleading conditions in court documents, there are different obligations for plaintiffs and defendants depending on whether a condition precedent has occurred or not.

Explanation: Rule 9(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure outlines that the plaintiff must generally plead that all conditions have been satisfied. However, when denying a condition precedent, the defendant must do so with particularity by pointing out specific conditions that haven't been met.

:p What rule governs the pleading of conditions precedent in civil procedure?
??x
Rule 9(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure states that plaintiffs must generally plead that all conditions have been satisfied. Defendants, on the other hand, must deny a condition with particularity by identifying specific unfulfilled conditions.
x??

---
#### Example of Conditions Precedent and Subsequent
Background context: Using an example where a plaintiff sues for breach due to non-performance based on a conditional agreement.

Explanation: In this scenario, if you are the defendant and want to argue that there was no condition precedent (the Red Sox winning the World Series), you must specify with particularity which condition did not occur. The plaintiff needs only to generally state all conditions have been satisfied.

:p If I sell my Ted Williams baseball for $400 if the Red Sox win the World Series, what must I do in a lawsuit?
??x
In your pleading, you need to generally state that "all conditions precedent have occurred or been performed." However, if there is a dispute, you should focus on specifying which condition did not occur with particularity.
x??

---
#### Default Order of Performance
Background context: Contract law typically requires both parties to perform simultaneously by default. This mutual obligation creates leverage for each party to ensure the other performs.

Explanation: The lack of a specified order can lead to disputes where one party might try to withhold performance until the other has performed, or vice versa. However, once one party has already performed, their leverage is diminished.

:p How does contract law typically handle the default order of performance?
??x
By default, contract law requires both parties to perform simultaneously, providing each party leverage to ensure mutual performance. Once a party performs first, they lose this leverage.
x??

---
#### Leveraging Conditions in Contracts
Background context: Conditions can be used as leverage in contracts by threatening to withhold or sue for damages if the other party does not meet their obligations.

Explanation: The non-breaching party loses its leverage once it has already performed. Therefore, the party who performs first is at a disadvantage and must consider the consequences of performing before the other party.

:p How can conditions create leverage in contracts?
??x
Conditions allow parties to threaten to withhold performance or sue for damages if the other does not meet their obligations as specified by the condition. However, once one party has performed, they lose this leverage, giving the non-breaching party an advantage.
x??

---

---
#### Simultaneous Performance in Contracts
Background context: In contractual agreements, the rule of simultaneous performance is often applied to ensure both parties fulfill their obligations at the same time. However, this ideal scenario can be disrupted by practical circumstances where one party's performance cannot be completed instantly.

:p What happens if performances are not due simultaneously?
??x
If performances are not due simultaneously, the party who has to perform first is at a disadvantage. For instance, in a service contract, the service provider must complete their work before receiving payment, which can expose them to financial risk.
x??

---
#### Time-Consuming Performances and Risk Management
Background context: When one performance takes time (such as providing a service), it often needs to be completed first according to the rule of simultaneous performance. This rule is particularly challenging for service providers who need payment before their services are fully utilized.

:p How can contractors mitigate the risk associated with performing first?
??x
Contractors can use statutory lien laws and require progress payments tied to specific milestones. These measures allow contractors to secure their work and reduce financial exposure.
x??

---
#### Retainer Payments in Legal Services
Background context: Similar to contractors, lawyers also face the challenge of providing services before receiving payment. To mitigate this risk, lawyers often require clients to pay a retainer as an upfront fee.

:p How do lawyers use retainers to manage their risks?
??x
Lawyers use retainers to secure payment in advance, ensuring they can proceed with the legal work without worrying about non-payment after completing their services.
x??

---
#### Credit Risk and Contractual Repossession Rights
Background context: Extending credit for goods or services increases risk for the creditor because it relinquishes the right to make performance conditional on payment. In such cases, it is crucial to include provisions in contracts that allow repossession if the other party fails to perform.

:p What should be included in a contract to protect against non-performance by the buyer?
??x
Contracts should contain explicit language granting the seller the right to repossess goods if the buyer fails to perform. Without this, the seller has no legal recourse if payment is not made.
x??
