**Starting Chapter:** Finding Exceptions to the Statute

---

#### Statute of Frauds Overview
The statute of frauds requires a written agreement to be enforceable, unless it is within an exception. For contracts not covered by exceptions, the writing must meet two conditions: 
1. It sufficiently describes the contract.
2. It is signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought.

:p What are the two main conditions that a writing must satisfy under the statute of frauds?
??x
The two main conditions for a writing to satisfy the statute of frauds are:
1. The writing must sufficiently describe the contract, which means it should identify the parties involved, the subject matter, and essential terms.
2. The writing must be signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought.

For example, if Tom sells his house to Mary for $300,000, a note left by Tom at his lawyer's office saying "Just sold my house to Mary for $300,000" would satisfy both conditions.
??x
---
#### Sufficiency of Description
Under the statute of frauds, the writing does not need to include all contract terms but must describe the agreement sufficiently. The UCC specifically states that a writing is not insufficient if it omits or incorrectly states a term.

:p Can you give an example where a writing satisfies the statute of frauds even though it omits some details?
??x
Yes, for instance, Tom signs a memo stating "Just sold Tom Smith Type X widgets." While this identifies the parties and subject matter, it fails to state the quantity. However, if he had signed it as "Just sold 100 Type X widgets," it would be sufficient because it includes the necessary terms like quantity.

If the actual agreement was for 200 widgets, the writing alone could not prove this, but it still satisfies the statute of frauds by sufficiently describing the contract.
??x
---
#### Signatures and Enforcement
Under the statute of frauds, a contract is enforceable if there's a written agreement signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought. If only one party signs, that party can enforce the contract but not the other.

:p What happens if you sign a writing while the other party does not?
??x
If you sign a writing and the other party does not, then:
- The other party can enforce the contract against you.
- You cannot enforce it against the other party.

For example, Tom agrees to sell his house to Mary for $300,000. If only Tom signs a note saying "Just sold my house to Mary for $300,000," he could not sue Mary for breach of contract if she fails to fulfill her obligations.
??x
---
#### Example Scenario with Note
Tom orally agrees to sell his house to Mary for $300,000. He leaves a note at his lawyer’s office saying "Just sold my house to Mary for $300,000." Later, Tom gets a better offer and refuses to sell the house to Mary.

:p Can Mary enforce the contract based on the note left by Tom?
??x
Yes, because the note satisfies the statute of frauds. It sufficiently describes the contract (identifying the parties, subject matter, and essential terms) and is signed by Tom, who is against whom enforcement would be sought.

Even though Tom left the note in a rush and forgot to include all details, it still serves as evidence that an oral agreement was made.

#### Definition of "Signed" and "Writing"
Background context: The statute requires a writing signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought. Courts are generally lenient when determining what constitutes a signing and writing.
Relevant formulas or data: Definitions from North Carolina 25-1-201(b)(37) and (43): 
- "Signed" includes using any symbol executed or adopted with present intention to adopt or accept a writing.
- "Writing" includes printing, typewriting, or any other intentional reduction to tangible form. “Written” has a corresponding meaning.

:p What does the definition of "signed" include in the context of the statute?
??x
The definition of "signed" includes using any symbol executed or adopted with present intention to adopt or accept a writing.
x??

#### Definition of "Writing"
Background context: The statute requires a writing, and courts are lenient regarding what constitutes this writing. Definitions from North Carolina 25-1-201(b)(37) and (43): 
- "Signed" includes using any symbol executed or adopted with present intention to adopt or accept a writing.
- "Writing" includes printing, typewriting, or any other intentional reduction to tangible form. “Written” has a corresponding meaning.

:p What does the definition of "writing" include in the context of the statute?
??x
The definition of "writing" includes printing, typewriting, or any other intentional reduction to tangible form.
x??

#### Electronic Signatures and Emails
Background context: Courts are generally lenient when determining what constitutes a signed writing. The UCC definitions can be applied to electronic communications like emails.

:p Can an email constitute a signed writing under the statute of frauds?
??x
Yes, an email can constitute a signed writing under the statute of frauds because the sender or signature line indicates the intention of the sender to adopt it, and printing reduces it to tangible form.
x??

#### Policy Exceptions to the Statute of Frauds
Background context: Courts tend to treat agreements as enforceable unless presented with good evidence to the contrary. The court may narrow the scope of the statute of frauds by interpreting the requirement of a signed writing more liberally.

:p What factors might courts consider to find exceptions to the statute of frauds?
??x
Courts might consider exceptions based on reliance, main purpose, restitution, and statutory exceptions in the UCC.
x??

#### Case Study: McIntosh v. Murphy
Background context: The case study of McIntosh v. Murphy illustrates how courts can interpret the statute of frauds differently.

:p What was the outcome of the McIntosh v. Murphy case?
??x
In the McIntosh v. Murphy case, the jury found that there was a year-long contract between McIntosh and Murphy, which Murphy breached by firing McIntosh before the end of the term. The court awarded McIntosh damages in the amount of $12,000.
x??

---

#### Statute of Frauds and Oral Contracts
Background context explaining how oral contracts are generally unenforceable unless there is a writing, especially for certain types of agreements. This concept is crucial in understanding enforceability, particularly in scenarios where an agreement is formed just before or after a deadline.
:p What does the statute of frauds state about oral contracts?
??x
The statute of frauds requires certain types of contracts to be in writing to be enforceable. This includes real estate transactions, agreements that cannot be performed within one year from their making, and others as specified by law.
x??

---

#### Time Calculation for Statute of Frauds
Background context explaining the impact of weekend days on contract formation dates when determining if a contract is subject to the statute of frauds. The key here is understanding how time is calculated in relation to the one-year rule.
:p How does the statute of frauds handle agreements formed on weekends?
??x
Under the statute of frauds, agreements that are not fully performed within one year from their formation may need a writing for enforceability. If an agreement is formed on a weekend and takes more than a year to perform (including any part of it), it might be subject to the statute of frauds requirements.
x??

---

#### Trial Judge’s View
Background context explaining that the trial judge believed applying the statute of frauds would render the law ridiculous, especially when considering weekends. This view challenges traditional interpretations by proposing an unconventional approach to time calculation.
:p According to the trial judge, why does he think the statute of frauds makes the law look ridiculous?
??x
The trial judge thought that treating weekends as part of the one-year performance period would render the law unreasonable and impractical. He believed that weekends should not count when calculating the time for contract performance under the statute of frauds.
x??

---

#### Appellate Majority’s View
Background context explaining how the majority in the appellate court found a way around the statute of frauds by considering reliance as an exception to enforceability. This approach focuses on the reasonable and substantial change in position of one party due to another's promise.
:p How did the majority in the appellate court circumvent the application of the statute of frauds?
??x
The majority in the appellate court created an exception based on reliance. They allowed enforcement of the oral agreement because McIntosh had reasonably relied on Murphy’s promise, which involved relocating to Hawaii. This approach focused on compensating McIntosh for his relocation expenses rather than his lost expectancy.
x??

---

#### Appellate Dissent’s View
Background context explaining that the dissent believed in strict adherence to statutory law, regardless of the hardship or practical implications. This view emphasizes the role of the court as a neutral arbiter following legislative intent without considering specific circumstances.
:p According to the dissenting opinion, why should McIntosh not be entitled to damages?
??x
The dissent argued that courts must follow the dictates of the legislature and should not deviate from statutory law, even if it causes hardship. In their view, because the agreement was formed on a weekend and thus subject to the statute of frauds, McIntosh would not be entitled to damages.
x??

---

#### Reliance Exception in Statute of Frauds
Background context explaining that while oral agreements are generally unenforceable under the statute of frauds, courts may enforce them if one party reasonably relied on the promise. This exception is often applied in real estate transactions or other significant contracts.
:p Can an oral agreement be enforced under the statute of frauds if a party has reasonably relied on it?
??x
Yes, an oral agreement can be enforced if a party has reasonably and substantially relied on another's promise, even though such agreements are usually required to be in writing. For example, if Joe orally agrees to sell land to Mary and she builds a house on the land based on this promise, a court may find that her reliance bars Joe from raising the statute of frauds as a defense.
x??

---

#### Main Purpose Rule
Background context explaining how the main purpose rule applies to suretyship agreements where a third party agrees to perform if another party doesn’t. This rule is used to determine enforceability based on the intent and motive behind the agreement.
:p How does the main purpose rule apply in suretyship agreements?
??x
The main purpose rule applies to suretyship agreements when the primary purpose of the third party’s agreement is for their own financial advantage. In such cases, contract law recognizes that the third party has assessed the risks and benefits, making the statute of frauds less relevant. As a result, if the agreement falls within the statute of frauds but its main purpose is self-interest, it may still be enforceable.
x??

---

#### Oral Agreement and Statute of Frauds
Background context: The statute of frauds is a legal requirement that certain types of agreements must be in writing to be enforceable. However, oral promises can sometimes create an exception if they meet specific conditions such as part performance or reliance.

:p What is the main reason why Harry's oral agreement with Dick is not within the statute of frauds?
??x
Harry’s oral agreement with Dick does not fall under the statute of frauds because the primary purpose of the promise was to benefit himself (Harry) rather than create a mutual benefit. This means that while part performance might exist, it does not constitute a valid exception to the statute of frauds.
x??

---

#### Part Performance and Restitution
Background context: Part performance can sometimes be used as an exception to the statute of frauds if it shows that one party has relied on the agreement sufficiently. If the court finds no enforceability, restitution can be sought for the value of that part performance.

:p What happens when a court does not accept part performance as making the contract enforceable?
??x
If a court does not find the oral agreement to be enforceable due to lack of part performance or other reasons, it means the agreement was not sufficiently written. In such cases, a party can still seek restitution for the value of any part performance that occurred.

For example:
- Tom ordered materials from Dick, but did not pay.
- Harry agreed to pay for those materials, constituting part performance by his acceptance and action.
- If the court finds the agreement unenforceable because it lacks writing, Harry can still recover the value of what he paid or contributed in good faith.

This is based on the principle that a party should be able to recover the value conferred even if the contract itself cannot be enforced due to lack of written form.
x??

---

#### UCC Section 2-201 and Confirmation Exception
Background context: The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) provides several exceptions under its statute of frauds, including confirmation by a party. This can bind another party to an oral agreement if certain conditions are met.

:p What is the UCC’s confirmation exception?
??x
The UCC’s confirmation exception applies between merchants and states that a writing in confirmation of an oral contract sent by one merchant is binding on the receiving merchant, unless written notice of objection is given within 10 days after receipt. For example:
- A grain buyer from Minneapolis makes oral agreements with farmers.
- The buyer records these orders and sends confirmations to the farmers upon return to the office.
- If a farmer accepts the confirmation without objecting in 10 days, it becomes binding.

UCC §2-201(2) states: "Between merchants if within a reasonable time a writing in confirmation of the contract and sufficient against the sender is received and the party receiving it has reason to know its contents, it satisfies the requirements of subsection (1) against such party unless written notice of objection to its contents is given within ten days after it is received."

```java
// Example UCC Section 2-201 Implementation in Pseudocode

public class MerchantConfirmation {
    public void sendConfirmation(String orderDetails, Date dateSent) {
        // Send confirmation with order details and date
    }

    public boolean receiveAndValidate(String confirmation, Date dateReceived) {
        if (isReasonableTime(dateReceived, dateSent)) {
            return true; // Confirmation valid within 10 days
        } else {
            return false; // Outside reasonable time
        }
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Confirmation Defense
Background context: The confirmation defense is raised when a contract doesn't meet the statute of frauds requirements but is otherwise valid. Some farmers argue they're not merchants, which has persuaded some courts despite modern market savvy. 
:p What are some arguments used by farmers to avoid the application of the statute of frauds?
??x
Farmers may claim that they are not merchants and therefore fall outside the scope of the UCC’s statute of frauds provisions. However, this argument is considered poor given the current level of market awareness among farmers.
x??

---
#### Specially Manufactured Goods Exception
Background context: The UCC's statute of frauds doesn't apply to specially manufactured goods when a seller begins manufacturing under an oral agreement. Specific conditions need to be met for enforcement.
:p What exception does the UCC provide for specially manufactured goods?
??x
The UCC provides that if goods are to be specially manufactured for the buyer and not suitable for sale in the ordinary course of the seller's business, the contract is enforceable even if it’s oral. The seller must have made a substantial beginning of their manufacture or commitments for procurement before receiving notice of repudiation.
x??

---
#### Performance Waiver
Background context: Once both parties perform under a contract, they can't claim that an oral agreement was unenforceable due to the UCC's statute of frauds. This is based on the doctrine of waiver.
:p Under what circumstances is it too late to claim the UCC’s statute of frauds defense?
??x
Once both parties have performed their obligations under a contract, they cannot later raise the UCC’s statute of frauds as a defense because mutual performance indicates no intent to defraud and constitutes a waiver.
x??

---
#### Admission Exception
Background context: An oral agreement can be enforced even if it lacks a writing if one party admits to making the agreement in court. The admission must be under oath.
:p What is the admission exception, and how does it work?
??x
The admission exception allows an oral contract to be enforceable even without a written record if one party admits, under oath, that such a contract was made. This admission can be through pleading, testimony, or other court statements.
x??

---

---
#### Admission Exception to the Statute of Frauds
Background context: The statute of frauds requires certain contracts, typically those involving the sale of goods over a specified monetary amount, to be in writing. However, there are exceptions where admitting an oral agreement can prevent the benefit of this statutory requirement.

:p What is the admission exception to the statute of frauds?
??x
The admission exception allows a party who admits making an oral agreement to be bound by it, even if the agreement does not meet the written requirements of the statute of frauds. Essentially, once a party acknowledges the existence and terms of the agreement under oath, they cannot later deny its validity in court.
x??

---
#### Statute of Frauds and Oral Agreements
Background context: The statute of frauds often requires certain types of agreements to be in writing for them to be enforceable. However, in cases where a written confirmation is sent but disputed by the parties, it can lead to lengthy legal arguments.

:p How did the Oregon Court of Appeals case illustrate an interesting aspect of the statute of frauds?
??x
In the Oregon Court of Appeals case involving the sale of cedar shakes from a Canadian corporation to an American corporation, the agreement was oral. Despite the seller sending a written confirmation, there was debate over whether it satisfied the requirements under the Oregon UCC. The legal dispute focused on determining if the confirmation met the statute of frauds criteria.

The interesting aspect revealed that the parties had overlooked the fact that their contract should have been governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG). The CISG provides that no statute of frauds applies to international agreements for the sale of goods. This highlighted the importance of carefully scrutinizing contracts, especially international ones, to ensure they are properly governed.

:x??

---
#### Application of the UCC and Statute of Frauds
Background context: The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) governs sales of goods in many jurisdictions. It includes provisions related to the statute of frauds for certain types of agreements involving goods.

:p What is the common mistake regarding the UCC's application?
??x
A common mistake is assuming that the UCC does not apply to contracts for the sale of goods worth less than $500. In fact, the UCC applies to all sales of goods, regardless of value. For transactions valued under $500, the specific statute of frauds provisions in the UCC do not apply.

For instance, if a contract is for the sale of goods worth less than $500, the usual requirement that such contracts be in writing (statute of frauds) does not apply.
x??

---
#### International Contracts and CISG
Background context: The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) is an international treaty that governs certain sales agreements between parties from different countries.

:p How does the CISG differ regarding the statute of frauds?
??x
The CISG provides a significant exception to the typical statute of frauds requirements. Specifically, Article 11 states: "A contract of sale need not be concluded in or evidenced by writing and is not subject to any other requirement as to form." This means that oral contracts for the international sale of goods are valid and can be enforced.

The key difference is that under CISG, there is no statutory requirement that a written agreement be produced. Oral agreements and other forms of evidence can suffice.
x??

---
#### Summary
This text discusses various aspects of contract law, focusing on exceptions to the statute of frauds, international contracts, and the application of different legal frameworks such as the UCC and CISG. Understanding these nuances is crucial for ensuring enforceability in diverse contractual scenarios.

#### Concept of Contract Gaps and Interpretation
Background context: No contract can cover all possible scenarios, leading to gaps or ambiguities. Courts play a crucial role in interpreting these gaps and ambiguous terms to resolve disputes.

:p What is the primary issue addressed by court interpretation in contracts?
??x
Courts often face the challenge of determining what parties intended when drafting a contract and how those intentions should be applied in unforeseen circumstances.
x??

---

#### Contract Terms Ambiguity Resolution
Background context: Parties may disagree on the meaning of certain terms due to ambiguities or gaps. Courts use various strategies to resolve these disputes, ensuring fair outcomes for both parties.

:p How do courts typically handle ambiguous contract terms?
??x
Courts use several methods such as:
1. **Extrinsic Evidence**: Considering external evidence like negotiations, agreements, and industry standards.
2. **Contextual Clues**: Examining the overall context of the agreement to infer meaning.
3. **Reasonable Person Standard**: Determining what a reasonable person in the same situation would understand by the terms.

For example:
```java
public class ContractInterpretation {
    public static String interpretTerm(String term, Map<String, String> context) {
        // Examine contextual clues and external evidence to determine meaning
        if (context.containsKey(term)) {
            return context.get(term);
        } else {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Term is ambiguous without sufficient context.");
        }
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Reasonable Person Standard in Contract Interpretation
Background context: The "reasonable person" standard helps courts interpret ambiguous contract terms by considering how a typical party would understand the language.

:p What is the reasonable person standard?
??x
The reasonable person standard is a legal principle used to interpret ambiguous contracts. It considers what an average, prudent individual would have understood from the wording and context of the agreement.
x??

---

#### External Evidence in Contract Interpretation
Background context: External evidence can provide insights into parties' intentions when drafting the contract. This includes emails, meeting minutes, and other documents not part of the formal contract.

:p How does external evidence assist in resolving contract disputes?
??x
External evidence helps clarify ambiguous terms by providing additional information about the parties' intent at the time of agreement. For example:
- Emails between parties discussing specific provisions.
- Meeting notes that detail discussions on key clauses.
```java
public class ExternalEvidence {
    public static String resolveAmbiguity(String term, List<String> externalDocs) {
        for (String doc : externalDocs) {
            if (doc.contains(term)) {
                return doc;
            }
        }
        return "Term not resolved by available documents.";
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Contextual Clues in Contract Interpretation
Background context: The broader context of the contract, including other clauses and the overall purpose of the agreement, can help resolve ambiguous terms.

:p How does contextual analysis aid in interpreting contracts?
??x
Contextual clues are used to understand how different parts of a contract relate to each other. By analyzing the entire document, courts can infer the meaning of unclear terms based on their logical relationship with other provisions.
x??

---

#### Drafting Better Contracts through Understanding Court Interpretation
Background context: Knowledge of how courts interpret contracts helps in drafting clearer and more comprehensive agreements that anticipate potential disputes.

:p How does understanding court interpretation techniques benefit contract drafting?
??x
Understanding court interpretation techniques allows drafters to:
1. **Predict likely interpretations**: Anticipate how courts might interpret ambiguous terms.
2. **Clarify language**: Use precise language to minimize ambiguity.
3. **Incorporate context clues**: Ensure other parts of the contract support and clarify key provisions.

For example, when drafting a term involving payment schedules, incorporating clear references to related deadlines can reduce disputes:
```java
public class ContractDrafting {
    public static String draftTerm(String purpose, List<String> supportingProvisions) {
        return "This clause is intended to ensure timely payments: [" + String.join(", ", supportingProvisions) + "]";
    }
}
```
x??

#### Introduction to Parol Evidence Rule
Background context explaining the parol evidence rule. The rule addresses situations where terms agreed upon by parties are not included in a written contract but may be presented as part of the agreement. The rule states that once an agreement is reduced to writing and intended by the parties to be complete, additional oral evidence (parol) cannot contradict or add to it.
:p What is the parol evidence rule?
??x
The parol evidence rule prevents the introduction of external oral agreements into a written contract. If a party wants to introduce such terms, they must prove that:
1. The writing was intended by both parties to be complete and final.
2. The new term does not contradict any existing terms in the writing.

For example, if two parties sign a lease agreement but later one party claims an oral promise to make necessary repairs, the rule would generally exclude this from being part of the contract unless it can be proven that:
- Both intended the written agreement to be final.
- The oral promise did not contradict any terms in the written document.

??x
---
#### Purpose and Application of Parol Evidence Rule
The parol evidence rule serves to clarify when external oral agreements are admissible. It ensures that only the terms explicitly included in the written contract are considered part of the agreement, reducing ambiguity and disputes.
:p How does the parol evidence rule determine admissibility of additional terms?
??x
The parol evidence rule determines admissibility by considering:
- Whether both parties intended the written document to be final and comprehensive.
- Whether the writing is complete and unambiguous.

If these conditions are met, extrinsic (oral) evidence cannot contradict or add to the written agreement. For instance, if a construction contract specifies payment terms and one party later claims an oral promise for additional work without extra compensation, this would likely be inadmissible unless:
- Both parties clearly intended the writing to cover all details.
- The oral term does not conflict with existing terms.

??x
---
#### Intent of Parties and Writing Completeness
The parol evidence rule hinges on whether both parties intended their written contract to be a final and complete statement. If they did, any additional terms must either be included in the writing or cannot be enforced.
:p How do courts determine if a written agreement is intended to be comprehensive?
??x
Courts assess whether the parties intended the written agreement to be comprehensive by considering factors such as:
- The language of the contract.
- Any surrounding circumstances like negotiations and communications.
- Whether there were subsequent modifications or addenda.

For example, in a car purchase agreement, if both parties explicitly state that all terms are final and no additional conditions apply, courts would likely uphold this unless clear evidence suggests otherwise. 

```java
public class Example {
    public static boolean isComprehensive(String agreement) {
        // Check for explicit statements of finality
        String[] keywords = {"final", "complete"};
        return containsKeywords(keywords, agreement);
    }

    private static boolean containsKeywords(String[] keywords, String text) {
        for (String keyword : keywords) {
            if (text.contains(keyword)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
x??

---
#### Types of Parol Evidence
Parol evidence can come in various forms outside the written contract. Common types include verbal promises, emails, and other communications that parties may use to support their claims.
:p What are examples of parol evidence?
??x
Examples of parol evidence include:
- Verbal promises made before or after signing a contract.
- Emails and text messages discussing terms not included in the written document.
- Notes from meetings where agreements were reached verbally but not documented.

For instance, if one party claims they verbally agreed to additional services that aren't in the written contract, their emails and notes could be considered parol evidence.

??x
---
#### Evaluating Parol Evidence Against Written Terms
When evaluating whether a term outside the written agreement should be enforced, courts consider:
- Whether it would contradict or add to existing terms.
- If both parties intended the writing to be comprehensive.
- The overall fairness of including additional terms.

If the parol evidence contradicts the written contract, it is generally inadmissible unless there’s clear intent and no conflict.
:p How do courts determine if extrinsic evidence should be considered?
??x
Courts use a multi-faceted approach:
1. **Contradiction Check**: Determine whether the external term would contradict any terms in the written agreement.
2. **Intent Analysis**: Assess whether both parties intended the writing to be final and complete.
3. **Fairness Consideration**: Evaluate if including additional terms is fair.

For example, if a contract specifies a fixed price for materials but a party claims an oral promise of free installation, courts would consider:
- Is there clear intent that the written document was comprehensive?
- Does the oral term contradict the written agreement?

If both parties intended the writing to be final and no contradiction exists, the court might still allow consideration if it deems it fair.

??x

#### Parol Evidence and the Parol Evidence Rule
Parol evidence refers to oral or written statements outside of the formal, written contract. The parol evidence rule generally prohibits parties from introducing extrinsic (oral or written) evidence that contradicts or modifies the written terms of a contract.

:p What is the parol evidence rule?
??x
The parol evidence rule prevents parties from using extrinsic evidence to alter, contradict, or add to the terms of a written contract. This rule ensures that once a contract is in writing, its terms are final and conclusive.
x??

---

#### Mitchill v. Lath Case Example
In the case of Mitchill v. Lath, the buyer alleged that the seller promised verbally to tear down an ice house. The parol evidence here refers to the oral promise made by the seller.

:p What was the scenario in the Mitchill v. Lath case?
??x
The buyer claimed that the seller had orally promised to tear down an unsightly ice house on property across the street. This claim used an oral agreement (parol evidence) as proof of a term not present in the written contract.
x??

---

#### Identifying Parol Evidence
After identifying parol evidence, you need to determine if it invokes the parol evidence rule by understanding why it is being offered.

:p How do you identify whether parol evidence invokes the parol evidence rule?
??x
You must first identify the purpose of the evidence. If the evidence is presented to prove a term not in the written contract, then it may invoke the parol evidence rule. Otherwise, it usually does not.
x??

---

#### Purposes That Do Not Invoke the Parol Evidence Rule
Parol evidence can be used for various purposes that do not involve adding terms or modifying the contract.

:p What are some examples of purposes that do not invoke the parol evidence rule?
??x
Examples include proving a modification, defending formation, proving an unfulfilled condition, or explaining the meaning of a term in the written agreement.
x??

---

#### Determining the Purpose of Evidence
In court, you might face situations where parties offer parol evidence. Understanding its purpose is crucial for applying the parol evidence rule.

:p In what scenario might the parol evidence rule be applied?
??x
If a party offers parol evidence to prove that a term not in the written contract should be added or modified, this would invoke the parol evidence rule and potentially influence the court's decision.
x??

---

#### Mitchill v. Lath Revisited
During the trial of Mitchill v. Lath, the seller might argue against allowing testimony about the oral promise due to the parol evidence rule.

:p What happened in Mitchill v. Lath during the trial?
??x
The buyer testified that the seller had promised to tear down the ice house, but before completing his statement, the seller’s lawyer objected on the grounds of the parol evidence rule. The judge would then need to decide if this oral promise could be considered.
x??

---

#### Conclusion: Applying the Parol Evidence Rule
Understanding and applying the parol evidence rule is crucial for evaluating written contracts and extrinsic evidence.

:p What are the key steps in evaluating parol evidence under the parol evidence rule?
??x
1. Identify the parol evidence.
2. Determine if it invokes the parol evidence rule by understanding its purpose (proving a term, modification, defense, condition, or meaning).
3. Apply the rule based on the court's interpretation of these purposes.
x??

---

---
#### Before Signing the Agreement
Background context: The parol evidence rule applies to terms agreed upon before signing a written agreement. If a party offers proof of such a term, it is considered part of the original agreement.

:p What happens if a party tries to introduce a term that was agreed upon before signing the written contract?
??x
The parol evidence rule applies in this case. The term is considered part of the original agreement and cannot be changed or disputed through additional oral evidence unless there is clear proof of misrepresentation or fraud.
x??

---
#### After Signing the Agreement
Background context: If parties agree to modify a written agreement after signing, the parol evidence rule does not apply. This means that any new terms can be introduced as long as they are mutually agreed upon.

:p What happens if a party tries to introduce a term that was agreed upon after signing the written contract?
??x
The parol evidence rule does not apply in this case because the modification is part of an agreement reached after the original writing. The parties are free to add or change terms as long as both agree.
x??

---
