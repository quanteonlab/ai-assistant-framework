**Starting Chapter:** Getting Terms in Writing to Avoid the Parol Evidence Rule Quagmire

---

---
#### Defanging Subsection (a) of UCC § 2-202
Background context: To defang subsection (a) of UCC § 2-202, which allows evidence of prior agreements or contemporaneous oral modifications to be admissible, you can include a clause in the written contract that makes such evidence inadmissible. For example, "Evidence of course of dealing is not admissible to supplement or contradict this agreement." However, watch out for scenarios where you might need to admit such evidence.
:p How do you defang subsection (a) of UCC § 2-202?
??x
You can include a term in the written contract that makes prior agreements and contemporaneous oral modifications inadmissible. For example: "Evidence of course of dealing is not admissible to supplement or contradict this agreement." This clause effectively defangs subsection (a) by excluding such evidence from being admitted.

#### Encouraging Written Agreements
Background context: To avoid the pitfalls of the parol evidence rule, it's essential to encourage your clients to get all promises in writing before signing any contract. This practice helps ensure that all terms are clearly documented and reduces disputes over oral agreements not included in the written contract.
:p Why should you encourage your clients to get all promises in writing?
??x
Encouraging your clients to get all promises in writing is crucial because it ensures that all terms of the agreement are clearly documented. This practice minimizes the risk of disputes arising from oral promises that were not included in the written contract, thus avoiding the parol evidence rule quagmire.

#### Parol Evidence Rule Quagmire
Background context: The parol evidence rule can create a quagmire where oral agreements or prior writings are admissible to contradict or supplement the terms of a written contract. To avoid this issue, it's important to ensure that all promises are included in the written agreement.
:p What is the "parol evidence rule quagmire"?
??x
The parol evidence rule quagmire refers to situations where oral agreements or prior writings can be used to contradict or supplement the terms of a written contract, potentially leading to disputes and ambiguities. To avoid this issue, all promises should be included in the written agreement.

#### Getting Terms in Writing
Background context: By getting all terms in writing before signing any contract, you can prevent oral agreements from being used to contradict or supplement the written agreement, thereby avoiding the parol evidence rule quagmire. This practice ensures that both parties have a clear understanding of their obligations.
:p How does getting terms in writing help avoid the parol evidence rule?
??x
Getting all terms in writing before signing any contract helps avoid the parol evidence rule because it ensures that only the written agreement is considered legally binding. Oral agreements or prior writings cannot be used to contradict or supplement the written contract, thus avoiding potential disputes.

#### FTC's Used-Car Dealership Sticker Requirement
Background context: The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) discovered that used-car dealers were making promises not included in the written contract and later refusing to honor them. To address this issue, the FTC required dealers to put a sticker on the side window of the car with a message encouraging customers to get all promises in writing.
:p What did the FTC do to protect consumers from misleading promises by used-car dealers?
??x
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) protected consumers from misleading promises by used-car dealers through a requirement that dealers put a sticker on the side window of the car. The sticker advised customers to "Ask the dealer to put all promises in writing" because spoken promises are difficult to enforce.

#### Understanding How Contract Law Fills Gaps
Background context explaining how contract law fills gaps when parties fail to explicitly agree on certain terms. The parol evidence rule helps determine if additional terms are present but may not cover all gaps.
:p What is one way contract law addresses gaps in a contract?
??x
Contract law often supplies missing terms based on what reasonable parties would have agreed upon, even if those terms were not explicitly stated in the contract. This can include implied terms derived from the course of dealing between the parties or default rules established by courts and statutes.
x??

---
#### Parol Evidence Rule and Completeness
Explanation of how the parol evidence rule determines whether a contract contains additional terms that may fill gaps but does not always cover all potential missing terms.
:p How does the parol evidence rule affect the completeness of a contract?
??x
The parol evidence rule generally prevents parties from introducing oral agreements or prior writings to alter, contradict, or add to the written contract. However, this rule helps identify what is already agreed upon and may not cover all gaps left unfilled by explicit terms in the agreement.
x??

---
#### Reasonable Parties’ Assumptions
Explanation of how contract law infers missing terms based on what reasonable parties would have assumed if they had fully thought through their agreement.
:p How does contract law determine implied terms when parties fail to agree explicitly?
??x
Contract law often implies terms that reasonable parties would have agreed upon had they considered the matter thoroughly. This approach ensures fairness and completeness in agreements by filling logical gaps based on what would be expected from both parties under similar circumstances.
x??

---
#### Course of Dealing as Gap Filler
Explanation of how previous experience between the parties, known as course of dealing, can fill gaps in a contract.
:p How does course of dealing contribute to filling gaps in contracts?
??x
Course of dealing refers to the history and pattern of dealings between the parties that indicate what terms are commonly understood. If a party’s actions or past practices suggest certain terms implicitly agreed upon, courts may use this history to fill gaps in the current contract.
x??

---
#### Implied Warranties
Explanation of how implied warranties play a role in filling gaps in contracts and protecting buyers through quality and performance standards.
:p How do implied warranties contribute to gap-filling in contracts?
??x
Implied warranties ensure that goods or services provided meet certain standards without needing explicit agreement. For instance, the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code) provides implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, which automatically fill gaps regarding quality and suitability.
x??

---
#### Excuses for Nonperformance
Explanation of how courts determine if nonperformance is excused due to unforeseen events by considering what reasonable parties would have agreed upon during contract formation.
:p How do courts decide when nonperformance is excusable?
??x
Courts consider whether nonperformance can be excused based on circumstances that reasonable parties would have considered when forming the contract. If an unforeseen event makes performance impracticable, the court may determine that such nonperformance is not a breach of contract.

#### Reasonableness in Contract Terms
Explanation of how reasonableness applies to various aspects of contracts like price, delivery time, and quality.
:p How does the principle of reasonableness apply to different elements of contracts?
??x
The principle of reasonableness applies across several key areas of a contract. For example:
- Price: Must be reasonable (UCC § 2-305).
- Time of Delivery: Item must be delivered in a reasonable amount of time, often based on custom.
- Location: Delivery is typically at the seller’s place of business or residence.
- Order of Exchange: Simultaneous exchange if not specified otherwise.
- Quality: Determined by warranty law (explained later).

The court constructs these terms to ensure they are fair and practical under normal circumstances.

#### Quantity Terms in Contracts
Explanation of why quantity is often a gap that cannot be filled by the courts due to lack of certainty, but how previous dealings or output can sometimes help establish reasonable quantities.
:p Why might quantity be difficult to fill as an implied term?
??x
Quantity is often challenging to imply because it lacks a clear, specific agreement. However, if past dealings provide context, such as consistent ordering patterns (course of dealing) or agreed-upon production levels (seller output), courts may infer reasonable quantities.

#### Filling Gaps Through Reasonable Terms
Explanation of how courts use the principle that reasonable terms should be implied where parties did not explicitly agree.
:p How do courts typically fill gaps in contracts?
??x
Courts apply the concept that reasonable terms should be implied where explicit agreements are missing. For example, if a contract lacks details like price, delivery time, or quality, courts may use established norms and principles to determine these terms based on what would be considered fair and customary.

---
#### Default Rules
Default rules are supplied unless the parties contract around them. They function similarly to default settings in a word-processing program, where they apply until changed by the user (parties). Examples include price gap-fillers, which set a reasonable price if not specified.

:p What are default rules?
??x
Default rules are terms that are provided as standard unless the parties agree on different terms. These typically cover aspects like price filling when not explicitly stated in the contract.
x??

---
#### Immutable Rules
Immutable rules cannot be changed by the parties and always apply to contracts. Examples include fundamental principles of contract law such as offer, acceptance, and consideration.

:p What are immutable rules?
??x
Immutable rules are terms that must always be part of a contract and cannot be altered by the parties involved. They encompass foundational elements like offer, acceptance, and consideration.

#### Duty of Good Faith in UCC
The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) defines good faith as "honesty in fact" and adherence to reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing. This means both subjective honesty and objective reasonableness must be maintained.

:p According to the UCC, what are the two requirements for good faith?
??x
According to the UCC, good faith requires:
1. **Subjective honesty**: Acting with truthfulness.
2. **Objective reasonable commercial standards**: Adhering to fair business practices recognized in the industry.
x??

---
#### Subjective Duty of Good Faith (Honesty)
Subjective good faith involves acting honestly and having no ulterior motives. Proving a lack of subjective good faith can be challenging as it requires showing dishonest intentions.

:p How is subjective good faith defined?
??x
Subjective good faith, or honesty in fact, means that one must act with truthful intentions without any hidden motives. Demonstrating a breach of this standard often involves proving dishonesty through evidence of ulterior motives.
x??

---
#### Objective Duty of Good Faith (Reasonableness)
Objective good faith requires adhering to reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing, consistent with established industry practices.

:p How is objective good faith defined?
??x
Objective good faith means following reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing as accepted within the business community. This can be demonstrated by comparing the party's actions against what a typical person in that business would consider reasonable.

#### Case Example: Neumiller Farms, Inc. v. Cornett
In this case, Neumiller Farms rejected potatoes delivered at $4.25 per hundredweight despite their suitability for making chips, as indicated by an expert test. They also stated they would buy cheaper potatoes elsewhere.

:p What did the court find in the Neumiller Farms case?
??x
The court found that Neumiller Farms did not act in good faith because:
- Subjectively: They were dishonest due to their motive of finding cheaper potatoes.
- Objectively: The rejected potatoes were suitable, and a reasonable person would have accepted them based on market prices.
