**Starting Chapter:** Using Reliance and Restitution as Remedies

---

---
#### Case Summary of Breach of Contract
Background context: The case discussed is from the California Supreme Court, focusing on whether an employee has to accept employment that is "different or inferior" to mitigate a breach of contract. Key points include the comparison between two roles and the criteria used by the court.

:p What does the California Supreme Court's decision in this case primarily focus on?
??x
The court's decision focused on whether the employment offered as mitigation was “different or inferior” from the original role, considering factors such as approval rights, production type, and filming location.
x??

---
#### Mitigation of Damages
Background context: The concept revolves around whether an employee should accept a different or inferior position to mitigate damages after a breach of contract. The court found that while the roles were different, they weren't necessarily inferior.

:p What did the majority of the California Supreme Court find regarding mitigation in this case?
??x
The majority found that the employment offered as mitigation was not "inferior" because there were substantial differences between the two roles, including approval rights, production type, and filming location.
x??

---
#### Reliance Damages
Background context: Reliance damages compensate for expenses incurred due to reliance on a party's performance. These can be sought in addition to expectancy damages.

:p How do parties typically seek reliance damages in a breach of contract case?
??x
Parties may seek reliance damages if they can prove that they incurred certain expenses due to their reliance on the other party’s performance, and these losses were caused by the breach.
x??

---
#### Restitution as a Remedy
Background context: Restitution requires the recipient to return the value of any benefit conferred upon them by the breaching party. The measure is the value of the benefit received.

:p What does restitution require in the context of breach of contract?
??x
Restitution requires that after one party confers a benefit on another, not as an officious act or gift, and the recipient should return the value of the benefit they received.
x??

---
#### Example of Reliance Damages Calculation
Background context: An example is provided to illustrate when reliance damages can be claimed. It involves building a platform for a pizza oven that wasn't delivered by the breaching party.

:p In which scenario would a party not be able to recover costs as reliance damages?
??x
A party cannot recover costs as reliance damages if the losses would have been incurred regardless of the breach. For example, if you promise a pizza oven and I build a platform for it, but you fail to deliver, and I still need an oven anyway, then buying a different one wouldn't qualify.
x??

---
#### Consequences of Breach
Background context: Expectancy damages can include direct and consequential damages depending on the circumstances.

:p What additional damages might be recoverable in addition to expectancy damages?
??x
In addition to expectancy damages, a party may also claim reliance damages, which consist of out-of-pocket expenses incurred due to reliance on the breaching party's performance. These can include direct (costs directly resulting from the breach) and consequential (losses that were reasonably foreseeable).
x??

---

#### Reliance Damages as a Fallback Position
Background context: In contract law, reliance damages are an alternative when expectancy damages (the profit one party would have earned) cannot be proven or are speculative. The court may limit reliance damages if the non-breaching party wasn't eligible for expectancy damages.
:p What is the fallback position in cases where expectancy damages cannot be established?
??x
The fallback position involves recovery of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the non-breaching party due to reliance on the contract. For example, a promoter who spent money promoting a fight that was later canceled can recover those promotional costs as reliance damages.
x??

#### Restitution for Breach of Contract
Background context: Restitution is a remedy where one party must return benefits conferred on them by the other party without intending it as a gift or forcing it. This often applies when performing fully or partially before a breach occurs, such as in cases involving down payments or partial performance.
:p What is restitution and how does it apply to breaches of contract?
??x
Restitution refers to returning the benefit conferred on the breaching party by the non-breaching party. For instance, if you give a $10,000 down payment for a house that I breach by refusing to sell, I must return the down payment as restitution.
```java
public class Example {
    public void refundDownPayment(int downPaymentAmount) {
        // Logic to refund the down payment amount
        System.out.println("Refunding $" + downPaymentAmount);
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Loss of Contract Scenario for Restitution
Background context: In a scenario where both parties performing would result in a loss rather than a gain, the non-breaching party can seek restitution for the value of the benefit conferred. This is applicable when the contract does not meet economic expectations.
:p What happens if both parties performing would result in a loss?
??x
If both parties performing would result in a loss (a losing contract), the breaching party may seek restitution instead of expectancy damages. For example, a contractor who incurs more costs than expected can claim for the value of the work already done.
```java
public class Example {
    public void calculateContractLoss(int totalCost, int contractPrice) {
        if (totalCost > contractPrice) {
            System.out.println("Claiming restitution for the completed portion: $" + totalCost);
        } else {
            // No claim for expectancy as both parties performing results in a loss
        }
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Calculating Restitution Value
Background context: The value of the benefit conferred is crucial in calculating restitution. It can be challenging to determine, especially when the incomplete work has potential resale value.
:p How do you calculate the benefit conveyed for restitution?
??x
Calculating the benefit conveyed involves assessing the reasonable value of the completed work. For example, a contractor who has built 90% of a house at $190,000 may claim that the portion built is worth more than its cost due to potential resale value.
```java
public class Example {
    public int calculateRestitutionValue(int completionPercentage, int totalCost) {
        double completedPortion = (completionPercentage / 100.0) * totalCost;
        return (int)(completedPortion + (totalCost * 0.1)); // Adding a profit margin
    }
}
```
x??

#### Substantial Performance and Recovery

Background context: When a party performs only partially and then breaches, courts must determine whether the dirty contract-breaker is entitled to recovery based on substantial performance. The extent of recovery depends on whether the performing party substantially completed the work.

:p What happens if the breaching party substantially performs?
??x
If the breaching party substantially performs, they can recover on the contract (Chapter 14 for details). They would recover whatever was promised them in the contract minus the damages due the other party. For example, a contractor completes 90 percent of the work on a $200,000 house and then quits; the owner finishes the remaining 10 percent at a cost of$30,000.

The breaching party can recover the contract price ($200,000) minus the damages ($30,000), which is $170,000. The owner gets an expectancy of a fully completed house worth $200,000 by paying the initial contractor $170,000 and the second contractor $30,000.

If the cost to complete is lower, say $15,000, most courts would limit the breaching party's recovery to the pro rata part of the contract that was completed. If the breacher did 90 percent of a $200,000 project, they should get no more than 90 percent of the contract price: $200,000 × 0.90 =$180,000.

:p How does the court handle situations where the breaching party doesn't substantially perform?
??x
If the court finds that the breaching party didn’t substantially perform, they can’t sue on the contract because they did not bring about the event necessary for payment. The breacher must fall back on a claim in restitution.

Most courts allow a breaching party to recover restitution but vary widely in measuring it. Some courts treat the situation as if the breaching party had substantially performed, starting with the contract price and subtracting the amount required to put the non-breaching party where he would’ve been had he received what was promised.

Other courts start with the value of the benefit conferred on the non-breaching party but cap the restitution to give the non-breaching party their expectancy. For example, a contractor does 50 percent of the work on a $200,000 house and then quits; the owner hires another contractor at a cost of$110,000.

If you start with the contract price, restitution based on the value conferred is 50 percent of the contract price: $200,000 × 0.50 =$100,000. However, because the owner hired a second contractor at $110,000, the first contractor can’t recover more than$90,000.

If you start with the value of the benefit conferred on the owner, the contractor might claim the value is $110,000. However, this doesn't necessarily reflect the true worth, and a better approach is to measure it from the non-breaching party's perspective—how much is the work worth to them?

:p How does the court measure the value of the benefit conferred?
??x
The value of the benefit conferred should be measured from the perspective of the non-breaching party. This means asking how much the work is worth to the owner. The maximum possible recovery would be $90,000 in the example above ($200,000 × 0.50 -$110,000), but it might be less if the work was of poor quality.

The court aims to provide financial justice while avoiding excessive penalties or rewards for performing parties who breach contracts partially. The goal is to ensure that both parties are treated fairly and receive what they reasonably deserve based on their contributions and the value of services rendered.

:p What does the term "restitution" mean in this context?
??x
Restitution refers to compensating a non-breaching party for the benefit conferred by the breaching party. In contract law, if a breach occurs after partial performance, restitution seeks to provide the non-breaching party with relief based on the value of services performed up until the breach.

The key concept is that the breaching party can recover part of their costs or labor provided they have substantially performed the contract. However, courts use various methods to measure this recovery, often starting from the contract price and adjusting for the completion cost or the value received by the non-breaching party.

:p How does the court determine if a party has substantially performed?
??x
Substantial performance is determined based on whether the breaching party completed a significant portion of the work that constitutes a material breach. If the breaching party substantially performs, they can recover damages or the contract price minus any additional costs incurred by the non-breaching party to complete the project.

For example, if a contractor completes 90 percent of a $200,000 house and then quits, the court might find that substantial performance occurred. The breacher would be entitled to recover the full contract price ($200,000) minus the cost of finishing by another contractor ($30,000), resulting in a recovery of$170,000.

:p What is the difference between substantially performing and not performing?
??x
Substantially performing means that a significant portion of the contract was completed in a way that meets the core requirements. If a party does not substantially perform, they do not meet the basic obligations under the contract, leading to different legal outcomes.

For instance, if a contractor completes only 50 percent of a $200,000 house and then quits, they have not substantially performed because less than half of the work was completed. The court may find that this is not substantial performance and deny recovery unless there are other claims like restitution based on the value conferred.

In contrast, if a contractor completes 90 percent of the project and only a small portion remains unfinished, they would likely be considered to have substantially performed. This distinction can significantly impact whether a breaching party can recover damages or the contract price minus completion costs.

#### Comparing UCC to Common-Law Remedies
Background context: In contract law, especially for transactions involving the sale of goods, Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) and common-law principles both aim to provide remedies that give the non-breaching party what they would have received had the contract been fully performed. However, UCC remedies use a more formulaic approach compared to common-law remedies.

:p What is the primary goal of both UCC and common-law remedies in transactions involving goods?
??x
The primary goal of both UCC and common-law remedies is to provide the non-breaching party with what they would have received had both parties fully performed their contractual obligations.
x??

---

#### UCC vs. Common-Law Formulas
Background context: While the ultimate goal of remedies in contract law for goods is similar, UCC provides a more formulaic approach compared to common-law principles.

:p How do UCC and common-law approaches differ in calculating remedies?
??x
UCC uses more formulaic approaches to calculate remedies, whereas common-law remedies are based on broader principles that may not always follow strict formulas. However, both aim to give the non-breaching party what they would have received if the contract was fully performed.
x??

---

#### The Role of Formulas in UCC Remedies
Background context: Article 2 of the UCC uses specific formulas to calculate remedies for breaches involving goods. Despite these formulas, courts are instructed to interpret and apply them liberally.

:p Why is it important for courts to follow a liberal approach when applying UCC formulas?
??x
Courts are instructed to apply UCC formulas liberally because exact calculations can be challenging in real-world scenarios. The aim is not to strictly adhere to the formulas but to achieve a fair outcome that aligns with common-law principles of fairness and justice.
x??

---

#### Key Differences Between Common-Law and UCC Remedies
Background context: A key difference between common-law and UCC remedies is the availability of market prices for goods. Goods can usually be bought and sold in a market, allowing courts to determine fair market value.

:p What distinguishes the approach of the UCC from that of common law when it comes to remedies?
??x
The UCC approach is more formulaic and relies on established market values, whereas common-law remedies are based on broader principles such as expectancy. The key difference lies in the availability of a ready market price for goods.
x??

---

#### Similarities Between Common-Law and UCC Remedies
Background context: Despite their differences, both UCC and common-law remedies share the goal of compensating non-breaching parties fairly.

:p How are UCC and common-law remedies similar?
??x
UCC and common-law remedies are similar in that they both aim to compensate the non-breaching party for losses incurred due to breach. They both consider factors such as expectancy, causation, foreseeability, certainty, and mitigation.
x??

---

#### Applying Common-Law Principles to UCC Formulas
Background context: When applying UCC formulas, courts may need to consider common-law principles that are not explicitly stated in the statutes.

:p How should courts handle UCC formulas when applying them?
??x
Courts should apply UCC formulas while considering broader common-law principles such as causation, foreseeability, certainty, and mitigation. These principles ensure a fair application of the formulas and align with the overall goal of contract law.
x??

---

#### Market Price for Goods
Background context: For goods that can be bought and sold in a market, determining a fair market price is crucial for calculating remedies under UCC.

:p How do market prices affect UCC remedies?
??x
Market prices are essential for UCC remedies as they help determine the value of goods. If no actual sale occurs, courts can use established market prices to calculate damages or other forms of relief.
x??

---

#### Absence of a Market
Background context: In cases where there is no ready market for goods, common-law remedies such as specific performance may be sought.

:p What happens when there is no market for the goods?
??x
When there is no market for the goods, the buyer may seek specific performance, which means demanding that the seller provide the promised goods. The court will consider whether specific performance is an appropriate remedy in such cases.
x??

---

#### Summary of Key Points
Background context: This section summarizes the key differences and similarities between common-law and UCC remedies, emphasizing their shared goal and the role of market prices.

:p What are the main takeaways from this chapter regarding UCC and common-law remedies?
??x
The main takeaways are that both UCC and common-law remedies aim to compensate non-breaching parties fairly. UCC uses more formulaic approaches but requires a liberal interpretation, while goods' market value is crucial for determining remedies. Common-law principles such as expectancy, causation, foreseeability, certainty, and mitigation play a significant role in the application of these formulas.
x??

---

---
#### Liberal Administration of Remedies
Background context explaining that remedies under Article 2 of the UCC must be liberally administered to serve general purposes. Section 1-305(a) states this principle, emphasizing that courts should aim to put the aggrieved party in as good a position as if the other party had fully performed.

:p What does liberal administration of remedies mean in the context of Article 2 of the UCC?
??x
Liberal administration of remedies means that courts should interpret and apply the rules regarding remedies broadly to ensure fairness. This principle is outlined in § 1-305(a) which states that remedies provided by this chapter shall be liberally administered, with the goal being to put the aggrieved party in as good a position as if the other party had fully performed. However, it does not allow for penalties or consequential damages unless specifically provided.

x??

---
#### Expectancy Damages
Explanation of how expectancy damages aim to place the non-breaching party in the position they would have been in had the contract been fully performed. Courts must be careful not to overcompensate or undercompensate, avoiding penal damages which would give an unfair advantage to the non-breaching party.

:p What is the primary goal of expectancy damages?
??x
The primary goal of expectancy damages is to place the non-breaching party in as good a position as if the other party had fully performed the contract. Courts must ensure that neither overcompensation nor undercompensation occurs, and they should avoid awarding penal damages, which would give an unfair advantage to the non-breaching party.

x??

---
#### Remedies for Breach by Sellers
Explanation of various remedies available when sellers fail to perform their contractual obligations, including specific performance, cover, and market remedies. 

:p What are the main remedies a buyer has when a seller breaches a contract?
??x
When a seller breaches a contract, buyers have several main remedies:
- **Specific Performance:** The court orders the defendant to deliver the promised goods.
- **Cover:** Obtaining goods from another source to fulfill contractual obligations.
- **Market Price:** Calculating damages based on the market price without obtaining alternative goods.

x??

---
#### Specific Performance
Detailed explanation of specific performance as an equitable remedy, contrasting it with remedies at law such as money damages. 

:p What is specific performance and how does it differ from a remedy at law?
??x
Specific performance is an equitable remedy where the court orders the defendant to perform their contractual obligations by actually delivering the goods rather than paying money damages for breach. It differs from remedies at law, which typically involve money damages.

Example:
```java
public class BreachOfContract {
    public void seekSpecificPerformance(String contractDetails) {
        // Logic to check if monetary compensation is inadequate and seek specific performance
        if (isMonetaryCompensationInadequate(contractDetails)) {
            System.out.println("Seeking specific performance from the court.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Money damages will suffice.");
        }
    }

    private boolean isMonetaryCompensationInadequate(String contractDetails) {
        // Logic to determine if the breach involves unique goods or services
        return contractDetails.contains("unique painting") || contractDetails.contains("fungible commodity");
    }
}
```

x??

---
#### Cover as a Remedy
Explanation of obtaining goods from another source (cover) as an alternative remedy when specific performance is not possible. 

:p How does the cover remedy work?
??x
The cover remedy involves purchasing substitute goods from another source to fulfill contractual obligations. This is used when specific performance is not feasible or when it would be overly burdensome for the buyer.

Example:
```java
public class CoverRemedy {
    public void obtainCover(String contractDetails) {
        // Logic to purchase equivalent goods from another supplier
        if (isSpecificPerformanceFeasible(contractDetails)) {
            System.out.println("Specific performance will be sought.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Obtaining cover to fulfill the contract obligations.");
        }
    }

    private boolean isSpecificPerformanceFeasible(String contractDetails) {
        // Logic to determine if specific performance is feasible
        return !contractDetails.contains("unique painting") && !contractDetails.contains("fungible commodity");
    }
}
```

x??

---
#### Market Price as a Remedy
Explanation of calculating damages based on the market price when buyers do not obtain goods from another source. 

:p How does the market price remedy work?
??x
The market price remedy involves calculating damages by determining the difference between the contract price and the current market price at the time of breach, without obtaining substitute goods.

Example:
```java
public class MarketPriceRemedy {
    public double calculateMarketDamages(double contractPrice, double marketPrice) {
        // Logic to calculate damages based on the difference in prices
        return Math.abs(contractPrice - marketPrice);
    }
}
```

x??

---

#### Specific Performance for Breach of Long-Term Contract
Background context: In some cases, specific performance may be appropriate as a remedy if one party breaches a long-term contract. For instance, if a buyer contracts with a seller to provide 100,000 barrels of crude oil each year for the next five years and then the seller breaches, the buyer not only loses the supply but also relies on the ongoing relationship.
:p What is specific performance in this context?
??x
Specific performance refers to a legal remedy where the court orders one party to perform their contractual duties as agreed upon. In this scenario, if the breaching party fails to provide the crude oil, the non-breaching party may seek an order from the court compelling the seller to continue fulfilling the long-term supply contract.
x??

---

#### Calculating Cover Damages
Background context: When a buyer is unable to get the promised goods from the seller due to breach, they can purchase substitute goods and calculate their damages based on the difference between the contract price and the cover price. The Code provides a formula in § 2-712(2) for calculating these damages.
:p How do you calculate cover damages?
??x
To calculate cover damages, follow this step-by-step process:
1. Determine the **cover price**: This is what the buyer had to pay another supplier to get the same goods elsewhere.
2. Identify the **contract price**: The price named in the original contract.
3. Assess any **incidental and consequential damages** (optional for now).
4. Calculate any **expenses saved by the breach**, such as reduced shipping costs.

The formula looks like this:
$$\text{Damages} = (\text{Cover Price} - \text{Contract Price}) + \text{Incidental and Consequential Damages} - \text{Expenses Saved by Breach}$$

For example, in the case of a buyer in Boston who contracted to buy 100,000 bushels of winter wheat at $7.50 per bushel with$50,000 shipping costs:
- Cover price: $8.00 per bushel (from Minneapolis)$\times $100,000 =$800,000
- Contract price: $7.50 per bushel $\times $100,000 +$50,000 shipping costs =$750,000 +$50,000 =$800,000

The formula for damages would be:
$$ (800,000 - 800,000) + 0 - 20,000 = \$30,000 $$Thus, the buyer is entitled to$30,000 in damages.
x??

---

#### Market Damages
Background context: If the market price of goods has risen higher than the contract price after a breach, and the buyer does not want to cover by purchasing substitute goods, they can recover the benefit of the bargain. This means they are compensated for the difference between what they paid under the contract and what the current market value is.
:p How do you calculate market damages?
??x
Market damages are calculated based on the difference in value between the contracted price and the actual market value at the time of breach, without the need to cover by purchasing substitute goods.

The key elements include:
1. **Contract Price**: The initial price agreed upon in the contract.
2. **Current Market Value**: The current price for similar goods available in the market after the breach occurred.

Example: Suppose a buyer contracted to buy 100,000 bushels of wheat at $7.50 per bushel but the market price rises to$9.00 per bushel due to supply shortages caused by the seller's breach.
- Contract Price = $7.50 $\times $100,000 =$750,000
- Current Market Value = $9.00 $\times $100,000 =$900,000

The difference is:
$$ \$900,000 - \$750,000 = \$150,000 $$Thus, the buyer can recover$150,000 as market damages.
x??

---

#### Market Damages Calculation in UCC §2-713
Background context: The formula for calculating market damages under UCC §2-713 uses the "market price" at the time the buyer learned of the breach. This is nearly identical to UCC §2-712, but uses "market price" instead of "cover price." When a breach occurs before performance, both formulas typically result in the same outcome as cover would have been done at market prices.
:p What formula does UCC §2-713 use for calculating market damages?
??x
UCC §2-713 uses the difference between the contract price and the "market price" when the buyer learned of the breach to calculate the damages. The market price refers to what a comparable car would cost at that time.
x??

---

#### Example Scenario with Car Purchase
Background context: If you sold me a car worth $11,000 for $10,000 and breached, I could cover by purchasing a similar car but elect not to. The market price difference ($11,000 -$10,000 =$1,000) would be the damages recoverable.
:p How much can you claim in damages if the market value of the car increases after your breach?
??x
You can claim $1,000 in damages because that is the difference between the contract price ($10,000) and the market price ($11,000) at the time I learned of your breach.
x??

---

#### Market Price vs. Time of Performance
Background context: In UCC §2-713, the language "learned of the breach" can create issues in anticipatory repudiation scenarios where a seller breaches before performance is due. Some courts use the market price at the time of performance instead of the time of repudiation to calculate damages.
:p Why might some courts use the market price at the time of performance rather than the time of repudiation?
??x
Some courts may use the market price at the time of performance because it reflects the actual cost the buyer incurs after a seller breaches. Using this approach can result in higher claimed damages but also increases the cost to breach, which is generally seen as counterproductive.
x??

---

#### Wheat Purchase Scenario with Anticipatory Repudiation
Background context: If you agreed to sell 100,000 bushels of winter wheat at $7.50 per bushel and on August 1 informed me that you won't perform, the buyer can recover damages based on the market price at October 1 ($8.00) minus the contract price ($7.50 * 100,000 =$750,000). However, mitigating by buying at the time of repudiation could reduce damages.
:p How much can the buyer claim in damages if they use the market price on October 1?
??x
The buyer can claim $50,000 in damages based on the difference between the market price of $8.00 per bushel ($800,000) and the contract price of$750,000.
However, if they mitigate by buying at the time of repudiation (August 1), where the market price was $7.75, their damages would be only $25,000 ($775,000 -$750,000).
x??

---

#### Best Choice for Mitigation
Background context: Using the market price at the time of repudiation or a commercially reasonable time after buyer learns of it can reduce costs. This is because the buyer starts shopping for cover goods immediately, reducing waste and making better use of resources.
:p Why is using the market price at the time of repudiation considered the best choice?
??x
Using the market price at the time of repudiation or a commercially reasonable time after learning of it (to shop around) is considered the best because it reflects the actual cost the buyer incurs immediately. This reduces the overall damage to the buyer and aligns with the goal of minimizing losses.
x??

---

#### Cover Damages and Market Damages
Cover damages are calculated to reimburse a buyer for expenses incurred when they cover the contract by purchasing goods elsewhere. Market damages are based on the difference between the price paid under the original contract and the market price at the time of breach.

The UCC formula for both types includes consequential damages, which are recoverable if the seller had reason to know about them at the time of contracting.
:p What does the UCC rule cover regarding buyer's recovery of losses due to a seller's breach?
??x
Buyers can recover consequential damages that the seller should have foreseen at the time of contract formation. These include losses that could not reasonably be prevented by obtaining substitute goods or otherwise.
x??

---

#### Foreseeability Rule for Consequential Damages (Hadley Rule)
The UCC includes a rule to determine if buyer's consequential damages are recoverable, which is based on foreseeability. The relevant section of the UCC states: “Consequential damages resulting from the seller’s breach include any loss resulting from general or particular requirements and needs of which the seller at the time of contracting had reason to know and which could not reasonably be prevented by cover or otherwise.”

:p What defenses can a seller use against a buyer's claim for consequential damages?
??x
The seller can argue that they lacked advance knowledge about specific losses and that these losses could have been mitigated through reasonable measures, such as purchasing substitute goods.
x??

---

#### Loss Prevention Defense
Under the UCC, a seller is only liable for consequential damages if those losses are foreseeable. However, a buyer cannot recover for losses that they could reasonably prevent by covering or otherwise.

:p How does the loss prevention defense work in relation to breach of contract?
??x
The loss prevention defense works by stating that a seller should not be held responsible for losses that a buyer could have mitigated through reasonable actions such as purchasing goods elsewhere. For example, if a buyer could have avoided stopping production by buying wheat from another supplier, they cannot claim those lost profits.
x??

---

#### Incidental Damages
Incidental damages include expenses incurred due to the seller's breach, such as inspection, receipt, transportation, and care of goods rejected or delayed.

The UCC defines incidental damages in Section 2-715(1) as including “expenses reasonably incurred in inspection, receipt, transportation and care and custody of goods rightfully rejected, any commercially reasonable charges, expenses or commissions in connection with effecting cover and any other reasonable expense incident to the delay or other breach.”

:p What are incidental damages?
??x
Incidental damages are costs related to handling the goods when a seller breaches the contract. These include reasonable expenses for inspecting, receiving, transporting, and caring for rejected goods.
x??

---

#### Mitigation of Damages
Mitigation is a principle that requires buyers to take reasonable steps to minimize losses after a breach occurs.

The UCC implicitly encourages mitigation through Section 1-102, which allows the application of common-law principles. The concept ensures that parties are not allowed to profit from their own misfortune.
:p What does the concept of mitigation require in case of a contract breach?
??x
Mitigation requires that a buyer take reasonable steps to minimize losses after a breach occurs. This means they should try to cover the contract by finding substitute goods and not claim damages for preventable losses.

#### Incidental Expenses and Consequential Losses
Background context: If a buyer doesn’t receive correct goods, they may incur expenses storing or returning them. If no goods are delivered, the buyer incurs costs to find another seller. These minor expenses are typically foreseeable by the seller due to breach of contract.
:p What are incidental expenses in the context of breach of contract?
??x
Incidental expenses include storage and return shipping costs when incorrect goods are received or no goods are delivered at all. These are usually minor, predictable consequences that a party should reasonably foresee as resulting from non-performance.

#### Attorney’s Fees and the American Rule
Background context: Under the American Rule in contract law, parties aren’t entitled to recover attorney's fees unless they are specifically provided for in the contract or under a statute. The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) does not provide for such recovery.
:p Can a buyer claim reasonable attorney's fees if their case is successful?
??x
No, under the American Rule and as per UCC provisions, a buyer cannot recover attorney’s fees unless they are specifically provided for in the contract or recovered under a statute. The UCC does not include provisions for awarding attorney’s fees.

#### Cover Damages and Market Damages
Background context: In cases of breach, the seller may be required to pay cover damages (costs incurred by the buyer to find substitute goods) or market damages (difference between contract price and market value). Expenses saved due to the seller's breach are deducted from these types of damages.
:p What is the principle behind deducting expenses saved in consequence of a seller’s breach?
??x
The principle is that if a breach saves the buyer money, those savings should be subtracted from the damages owed by the seller. For example, if a buyer saves $20,000 on shipping due to the seller's failure to deliver goods as promised, this amount is deducted from any cover or market damage claims.

#### Acceptance and Revocation of Goods
Background context: A buyer may accept goods despite knowing they are not as promised. If a breach occurs after acceptance, the buyer can claim damages under UCC § 2-714(2), which states that the measure of damages is the difference in value between what was accepted and what should have been delivered.
:p What does UCC § 2-714(2) provide for when a buyer accepts goods and later discovers a breach?
??x
UCC § 2-714(2) allows a buyer to claim damages equal to the difference in value between the goods accepted and what they should have received. This is calculated as the value of the promised goods minus the actual value of the accepted goods.

#### Example Calculation for Damages Under UCC § 2-714(2)
Background context: Consider a scenario where a seller delivers a computer with a warranty but later breaches by delivering a computer that lacks certain features. The buyer must calculate damages based on this difference in value.
:p Calculate the difference in value if a 500-gigabyte hard drive is warranted and only a 250-gigabyte one is delivered?
??x
Assume:
- A 500-gigabyte hard drive sells for $1,000 (warranted price).
- A 250-gigabyte hard drive sells for $950 (actual price).

The difference in value = $1,000 -$950 =$50.

Alternatively:
If the cost to replace a 250-gigabyte drive with a 500-gigabyte one is $100, then the buyer can claim$100 as the difference in value.
