#### Exponential Distribution for Customer Stay Time
Background context: The time a customer spends in a bank is exponentially distributed with a mean of 10 minutes. This implies an exponential distribution parameter \( \lambda = \frac{1}{10} \).

:p What is the probability that a customer spends more than 5 minutes in the bank?
??x
The probability that a customer spends more than 5 minutes can be found using the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Exponential distribution:
\[ P(X > t) = e^{-\lambda t} \]

For \( t = 5 \) and \( \lambda = \frac{1}{10} \):
\[ P(X > 5) = e^{-\frac{1}{10} \cdot 5} = e^{-\frac{1}{2}} \]
??x

---

#### Conditional Probability of Exponential Distribution
Background context: Given that a customer is still in the bank after 10 minutes, what is the probability that they will spend more than 15 minutes total?

:p What is \( P(X > 15 | X > 10) \) for an exponentially distributed variable with parameter \( \lambda = \frac{1}{10} \)?
??x
The exponential distribution's memoryless property means:
\[ P(X > s + t | X > s) = P(X > t) \]
Given that the customer is already in the bank for 10 minutes, we are only interested in the remaining time. Thus:
\[ P(X > 15 | X > 10) = P(X > 5) = e^{-\frac{1}{2}} \]

This is because the additional 5 minutes (from 10 to 15) is independent of the previous 10 minutes.
??x

---

#### Exponential Distribution's Memoryless Property
Background context: The exponential distribution has a memoryless property, meaning that the remaining time until an event occurs does not depend on how much time has already passed. This can be expressed as:
\[ P(X > s + t | X > s) = P(X > t) \]

:p Explain why the Exponential distribution's memory allows for easy calculation of conditional probabilities.
??x
The memoryless property simplifies calculations because it means that the probability of an event happening in the future does not depend on how long we have already waited. For instance, if \( X \sim Exp(\lambda) \), then:
\[ P(X > s + t | X > s) = P(X > t) = e^{-\lambda t} \]
This property makes it easy to compute probabilities without needing to consider the history of the process.

For example, if we know that a customer has already been in the bank for 10 minutes and we want to find the probability they will be there for more than another 5 minutes:
\[ P(X > 15 | X > 10) = P(X > 5) \]
??x

#### Post Office Example with Two Clerks
Background context: In a post office, two clerks serve customers. Customer A walks in while B and C are being served.

:p What is the probability that customer A will be the last to leave?
??x
Given that either B or C will leave first (each has an equal chance), we can consider the problem as follows:

1. If B leaves first, then the remaining service times for A and C are independent and identically distributed.
2. The same applies if C leaves first.

Thus, each of the three customers is equally likely to be the last to leave:
\[ P(A \text{ is the last}) = \frac{1}{3} \]

However, considering only B and C, the symmetry implies that A has a 50% chance of being the last if we are given that one of them leaves first. Therefore:
\[ P(A \text{ is the last}) = \frac{1}{2} \]
??x

---

#### Exponential Distribution’s Memoryless Property
Background context: The memoryless property of the exponential distribution means that \( E[X | X > a] = a + E[X] \).

:p What is \( E[X | X > 20] \) for an exponentially distributed random variable with parameter \( \lambda \)?
??x
Given \( X \sim Exp(\lambda) \), the memoryless property tells us:
\[ E[X | X > a] = a + E[X] \]

For \( a = 20 \):
\[ E[X | X > 20] = 20 + E[X] = 20 + \frac{1}{\lambda} \]
??x

---

#### Relating Exponential to Geometric via δ-Steps
Background context: To understand the exponential distribution better, we can relate it to the geometric distribution by considering "δ-steps". If \( X \sim Exp(\lambda) \), then for small \( \delta \):
\[ Y \sim Geo(p = \lambda\delta) \]

:p What is the expected value of /tilde{Y}, and how does this relate to the exponential distribution?
??x
The expected value of a geometric random variable \( Y \) with success probability \( p = \lambda\delta \) is:
\[ E[Y] = \frac{1}{p} = \frac{1}{\lambda\delta} \]

As \( \delta \to 0 \), the time between trials (δ-steps) becomes very small, and the expected value of /tilde{Y}, which represents the time until success in continuous-time, is:
\[ E[\tilde{Y}] = \frac{1}{\lambda} \]

This shows that as \( \delta \to 0 \), /tilde{Y} converges to an exponential distribution with parameter \( \lambda \):
\[ E[\tilde{Y}] = \frac{1}{\lambda} \]
??x

#### Exponential Distribution’s Memoryless Property and Poisson Process
Background context: The exponential distribution's memorylessness is crucial in understanding the properties of a Poisson process. If events occur according to an exponential distribution with rate \( \lambda \), then the number of events in any interval follows a Poisson distribution.

:p How does the Exponential distribution help us understand the Poisson process?
??x
The Exponential distribution helps us understand the Poisson process by providing the time between events. If events occur according to an exponential distribution with rate \( \lambda \), then the number of events in any given time interval follows a Poisson distribution.

For example, if we have an exponential inter-event time distribution:
\[ T_i \sim Exp(\lambda) \]
Then the number of events \( N(t) \) in time \( t \) follows a Poisson distribution with parameter \( \mu = \lambda t \).

This relationship is fundamental for analyzing and modeling real-world phenomena such as customer arrivals, call center calls, or radioactive decay.
??x

#### Definition of o(δ)
Background context: The definition provided states that a function \( f \) is \( o(\delta) \) if as \( \delta \to 0 \), the limit of \( \frac{f}{\delta} \) tends to zero. This indicates that \( f \) goes to zero faster than \( \delta \). For example, \( \delta^2 \) is \( o(\delta) \) because \( \lim_{\delta \to 0} \frac{\delta^2}{\delta} = 0 \).

:p How do we determine if a function is \( o(\delta) \)?
??x
To determine if a function \( f \) is \( o(\delta) \), we need to check the limit of \( \frac{f}{\delta} \) as \( \delta \to 0 \). If this limit is zero, then \( f \) is \( o(\delta) \).

For example:
```java
public class Example {
    public static boolean isOOfDelta(double delta, double f) {
        return Math.abs(f / delta) < 1e-6; // Check if the ratio approaches 0 as δ → 0
    }
}
```

#### Exponential Distribution Property: Probability Calculation
Background context: The theorem demonstrates how to calculate the probability that one exponential random variable is less than another. Specifically, it states \( P(X_1 < X_2) = \frac{\lambda_1}{\lambda_1 + \lambda_2} \).

:p How do we prove the probability that one Exponential random variable is less than another?
??x
We can use a traditional algebraic proof or an intuitive geometric proof.

For the traditional algebraic proof:
```java
public class ExponentialProbability {
    public static double calculateProbability(double lambda1, double lambda2) {
        return lambda1 / (lambda1 + lambda2);
    }
}
```

For the intuitive geometric proof:
- Success of type 1 occurs with probability \( \lambda_1 \delta \) on each step.
- Independently, success of type 2 occurs with probability \( \lambda_2 \delta \) on each step.

The probability that a success is of type 1 given it has occurred (type 1 or type 2):
```java
public class GeometricIntuition {
    public static double calculateProbabilityGeometric(double lambda1, double lambda2) {
        return lambda1 / (lambda1 + lambda2); // As δ → 0, o(δ) terms approach zero.
    }
}
```

#### Minimum of Two Exponential Random Variables
Background context: The theorem states that the minimum of two independent exponential random variables is also exponentially distributed. Specifically, if \( X_1 \sim \text{Exp}(\lambda_1) \) and \( X_2 \sim \text{Exp}(\lambda_2) \), then \( Y = \min(X_1, X_2) \sim \text{Exp}(\lambda_1 + \lambda_2) \).

:p What is the distribution of the minimum of two independent exponential random variables?
??x
The minimum of two independent exponential random variables with rates \( \lambda_1 \) and \( \lambda_2 \), denoted as \( Y = \min(X_1, X_2) \), follows an exponential distribution with rate \( \lambda_1 + \lambda_2 \).

For example:
```java
public class MinimumExponential {
    public static double calculateMinimumProbability(double lambda1, double lambda2) {
        return (lambda1 + lambda2); // The rate of the minimum is the sum of individual rates.
    }
}
```

#### Example Application: Server Failure Probability
Background context: An example application involves two potential failure points for a server's power supply and disk. Both are exponentially distributed with different means, and we need to find the probability that the system fails due to the power supply.

:p What is the probability that the system failure caused by the power supply?
??x
Given:
- Power supply lifetime \( \sim \text{Exp}(1/500) \)
- Disk lifetime \( \sim \text{Exp}(1/1000) \)

The probability that the power supply fails first is given by:
\[ P(\text{Power Supply} < \text{Disk}) = \frac{\lambda_1}{\lambda_1 + \lambda_2} = \frac{1/500}{(1/500) + (1/1000)} = \frac{1/500}{3/1000} = \frac{2}{3} \]

Thus, the probability that the system failure is caused by the power supply is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

```java
public class ServerFailure {
    public static double calculateServerFailureProbability() {
        return (1 / 500) / ((1 / 500) + (1 / 1000)); // Calculate the probability
    }
}
```

#### Time until a Failure of Either Type

Background context: This concept deals with the time until either one of two independent Poisson processes (with rates λ1 and λ2) has a failure. The traditional algebraic proof uses properties of exponential distributions, while an alternative geometric proof uses trials occurring at regular intervals.

:p What is the rate for the time until there is a failure of either type in the server example?
??x
The rate for the time until there is a failure of either type is given by λ1 + λ2. In the provided example:
- λ1 = 1/500 (failure rate of power supply)
- λ2 = 1/1000 (failure rate of disk)

Thus, the combined rate is:
\[
\lambda_{combined} = \frac{1}{500} + \frac{1}{1000}
\]

In code form, this can be represented as:
```java
double lambdaCombined = 1.0 / 500 + 1.0 / 1000;
```

#### Poisson Process Definition 1

Background context: This definition of a Poisson process involves the following key points:
- N(0) = 0, meaning there are no events at time t=0.
- The process has independent increments, implying that the number of events in non-overlapping intervals is independent.
- The number of events in any interval of length t follows a Poisson distribution with mean λt.

:p What does Definition 1 imply about the rate λ?
??x
Definition 1 implies that the expected value (mean) of the number of events in an interval of length t, E[N(t)], is given by:
\[
E[N(t)] = \lambda t
\]

Since we can also express this as the average rate per unit time, we have:
\[
\frac{E[N(t)]}{t} = \lambda
\]

This means λ represents the average rate at which events occur in the process.

#### Poisson Process Definition 2

Background context: This definition states that a Poisson process has exponentially distributed interarrival times with parameter λ, and N(0) = 0. The key idea is to use independent exponential random variables for the interarrivals.

:p How would you simulate this Poisson process using Definition 2?
??x
To simulate a Poisson process using Definition 2:
1. Set the rate parameter \(\lambda\).
2. Generate independent exponential random variables with mean \(1/\lambda\) to represent interarrival times.
3. Sum these interarrival times to get the event times.

Here is an example of how this might be implemented in Java:

```java
import java.util.Random;

public class PoissonProcessSimulator {
    private double lambda;
    private Random randomGenerator;

    public PoissonProcessSimulator(double lambda, Random randomGenerator) {
        this.lambda = lambda;
        this.randomGenerator = randomGenerator;
    }

    public double[] simulate(int numEvents) {
        // Generate interarrival times
        double[] interArrivalTimes = new double[numEvents];
        for (int i = 0; i < numEvents - 1; i++) {
            interArrivalTimes[i] = -Math.log(1.0 - randomGenerator.nextDouble()) / lambda;
        }

        // Convert to event times
        double[] eventTimes = new double[numEvents];
        double cumulativeTime = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < numEvents; i++) {
            eventTimes[i] = cumulativeTime += interArrivalTimes[i];
        }
        return eventTimes;
    }
}
```

#### Independent Increments

Background context: For a process to have independent increments, the number of events in non-overlapping intervals must be independent. This means that knowing the number of events in one interval gives no information about the number of events in another interval.

:p Do the event processes (births, people entering a building, goals scored) have independent increments?
??x
1. **Births**: No. The birth rate depends on the population size, which increases with births.
2. **People Entering a Building**: Yes. Each person's arrival is independent of others.
3. **Goals Scored by a Player**: Maybe. This depends on the player’s form and performance, making it not entirely independent.

x??

---

#### Stationary Increments

Background context: Stationary increments imply that the distribution of events in any time interval of length t only depends on the length of the interval, not its starting point.

:p How does Definition 1 imply stationary increments?
??x
Definition 1 implies stationary increments because:
\[
N(t+s) - N(s)
\]
has the same distribution for all s. This is derived from the independent increments property, which ensures that the number of events in any interval [s, s+t] depends only on t.

For example, if we consider \(N(t+s) - N(s)\), it represents the number of events between time s and time t+s, which is equivalent to the number of events in an interval of length t regardless of its starting point s.

x??

---

#### Poisson Process Definition 3

Background context: This definition states that a process has:
- \(N(0) = 0\)
- Stationary and independent increments
- P{\(N(\delta) = 1\) } = λδ + o(δ)
- P{\(N(\delta) ≥ 2\) } = o(δ)

:p What does the condition P{N(δ) ≥ 2} = o(δ) imply?
??x
The condition \(P\{N(\delta) \geq 2\} = o(\delta)\) implies that as δ approaches zero, the probability of having two or more events in a small interval also approaches zero. This ensures that the process behaves like a Poisson process for very small intervals.

This can be understood through the limit behavior:
- As δ → 0, \((\lambda \delta)^2/2!\) and higher-order terms become negligible.
- Thus, \(P\{N(\delta) = i\} \approx (\lambda \delta)^i/i!\).

For two or more events, this probability becomes very small, confirming the Poisson nature of the process for short intervals.
