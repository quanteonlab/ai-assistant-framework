#### Risk of Loss in Truck Lease
Green Dollar leases a truck and trailer from National Rental Corporation. The lease includes a "Risk of Loss" provision where Green Dollar is obligated to bear the entire risk of loss and damage to the leased equipment. The truck and trailer are destroyed in a collision caused by Overland Trucking Company.
:p Is Green Dollar entitled to maintain an action against Overland?
??x
Green Dollar may not have standing to pursue a claim involving damage to the truck and trailer, as the lease specifically states that Green Dollar bears the risk of loss for any irreparably damaged equipment. This means that even though the collision was caused by Overland Trucking Company, it is not responsible for compensating Green Dollar since Green Dollar was obligated to bear the entire risk under the lease agreement.

However, Green Dollar can still file a lawsuit against Overland for damages if there are other provisions in the contract or local laws allowing them to recover losses from a third party.

#### Performance and Breach of Sales Contract
Green Dollar orders breakfast cereals from Grocers Distribution Company. The products were to be specially packaged with lesser quantities in smaller containers at lower-than-standard prices, but only some of the goods were shipped as specified; the rest came in standard packaging.

Delivery was supposed to take place "F.O.B. Green Dollar warehouse, Los Angeles by May 7," and the delivery occurred on April 30.
:p Can Green Dollar reject the shipment?
??x
Green Dollar has the right to reject the shipment because the delivery did not meet the agreed specifications. The terms of the contract specified that the goods should be specially packaged with lesser quantities in smaller containers at lower-than-standard prices, but Grocers Distribution Company delivered some standard packaging instead.

Grocers Distribution's breach entitles Green Dollar to reject the non-conforming goods and may entitle them to seek damages or other remedies as agreed upon in the contract.

#### Warranties Disclaimers
Steven Chao buys a hammer at a Green Dollar store. The label has instructions for its use, including an inconspicuous disclaimer that disclaims all implied warranties. Later, the handle breaks, and the detached head injures him.
:p Can Green Dollar be held liable to Chao for breach of warranty?
??x
Green Dollar can still be held liable to Chao for breach of warranty despite the disclaimer on the hammer's label. The disclaimer is generally not enforceable if it was hidden or inconspicuous and does not provide adequate notice to consumers.

In this case, since the wood in the handle was rotten at the time of sale but neither Green Dollar nor Chao could have known about it, the implied warranty of merchantability may still be applicable. This means that the product should be fit for its ordinary purposes, which is clearly violated by a broken hammer that caused injury.

#### International Law and Supply Chain
To offer goods at low prices, Green Dollar reduces costs by obtaining products from international sources whose charges are increasing due to global economic developments.
:p How do these price increases affect Green Dollar's supply chain strategy?
??x
The increasing prices from international suppliers can significantly impact Green Dollar's cost structure and profitability. To manage this risk, Green Dollar may need to consider several strategies:

1. **Negotiate with Suppliers:** Try to renegotiate terms with current suppliers or find new ones who offer more stable pricing.
2. **Diversify Supplier Base:** Spread the risk by using multiple international suppliers to hedge against price fluctuations.
3. **Currency Hedging:** Use financial instruments like futures contracts or options to stabilize currency exchange risks.
4. **Inventory Management:** Adjust inventory levels and ordering strategies to mitigate the impact of increased costs.

These measures can help Green Dollar maintain competitive pricing while managing financial risks associated with global economic changes.
