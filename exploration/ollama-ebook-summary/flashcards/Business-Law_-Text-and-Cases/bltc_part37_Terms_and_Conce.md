**Starting Chapter:** Terms and Concepts. Chapter 26 Transferability and Holder in Due Course

---

---
#### Type of Negotiable Instrument
Robert Durbin borrowed funds from a bank and signed a promissory note for repayment. The federal government guarantees that the note will be fully repaid if Durbin defaults.

:p What type of negotiable instrument was the note that Durbin signed, an order to pay or a promise to pay?
??x
The note Durbin signed is a **promise to pay**. A promissory note is a promise by the maker (Durbin) to pay a certain sum to the payee (the lender). It does not involve any third party ordering payment.

#### Interest Rate Requirement for Negotiability
If the note did not state a specific interest rate but instead referred to a statute that established the maximum interest rate, it might impact its negotiability.

:p Would the note fail to meet the requirements for negotiability if it only referenced a statutory maximum interest rate?
??x
The note would likely **not** fail to meet the requirements for negotiability. The requirement for negotiability of a promissory note is that it must be in writing and signed by the maker, specifying a certain sum of money to be paid on demand or at a fixed or determinable future time. The interest rate can be specified either explicitly or through reference to a statutory maximum.

However, if the statute referenced does not itself meet the requirements for negotiability, then there could be an issue. For example, the statute must provide specific details and clarity about the interest rate.

---
#### Method of Transfer to Government
The government obtained the promissory note through some form of transfer from the bank.

:p Which method must have been used to transfer the instrument from the bank to the government for it to become a holder under the law?
??x
For the government to be a holder, the transfer must have been made by **endorsement and delivery** or by any other valid method recognized by law. The specific method is not explicitly stated in the provided context but typically involves an endorsement (signing) of the instrument and physically delivering it to the new holder.

---
#### Failure of Consideration Argument
Durbin argues that because his school closed down, there was a failure of consideration.

:p Would Durbin’s argument about failing consideration likely be successful against the government if it is a holder of the promissory note?
??x
Durbin's argument about failing consideration would **not** likely be successful against the government if it is a holder. The government obtaining the note as a holder does not depend on Durbin receiving something of value in exchange for his promise to pay, as the government has guaranteed repayment regardless of whether Durbin completed his education.

However, this does not preclude other defenses or remedies available under contract law.
x??
---

---
#### Acceleration Clause
The concept relates to clauses that allow the lender to demand full payment if certain conditions are met (e.g., default).

:p Is an acceleration clause relevant in Durbin's situation where he defaulted on his promissory note?
??x
Yes, an **acceleration clause** could be relevant. This clause typically allows the lender to demand immediate full repayment of the loan upon a borrower's default or non-payment. In Durbin’s case, if such a clause existed and was triggered due to his failure to meet the minimum course load, it would allow the bank (or the government) to demand immediate repayment.

#### Negotiability of Promissory Notes

**Background context:**
In this scenario, we examine the negotiability and enforceability of promissory notes. A promissory note is a written promise to pay a certain amount of money on demand or at a definite time. The key requirements for a note to be considered negotiable include:

1. It must be in writing.
2. There should be an unconditional promise or order to pay a sum certain of money.
3. It must be signed by the maker.
4. It must be payable on demand, or at a definite time.

The case law from Vinueza v. Scotto, Gallwitz v. Novel, U.S. Bank, N.A. v. Gaitan, and Caraccia v. U.S. Bank, N.A., provides insights into the enforceability of promissory notes under different circumstances.

:p Is a promissory note negotiable if it is not payable at a definite time?
??x
A promissory note must be payable on demand or at a definite time to be considered negotiable. If the note does not specify a repayment date, it may be deemed non-negotiable and less enforceable in court.

For example, in Gallwitz v. Novel:
- The note read: "Glen Gallwitz 1-8-2002 loaned me $5,000 at 6 percent interest a total of$10,000.00."
- Since it did not state a time for repayment, the court likely would consider this non-negotiable.

??x
The answer is that if a promissory note does not specify a definite time for repayment, it may be difficult to enforce in court.
```java
// Pseudocode example of checking negotiability conditions
public class PromissoryNote {
    private String paymentDate; // null or specific date

    public boolean isNegotiable() {
        return paymentDate != null;
    }
}
```

#### Requirements for Negotiability: Bearer Instruments

**Background context:**
A bearer instrument is one that can be transferred to any person who holds it, without the need for endorsement. In cases where a note has been endorsed in blank (i.e., no specific payee), but not physically transferred, questions arise regarding enforceability.

In U.S. Bank, N.A. v. Gaitan:
- Gaitan signed a note payable to Encore Credit Corp.
- Encore endorsed the note in blank and later filed for foreclosure by U.S. Bank.
- However, there was no evidence that the note had been transferred or negotiated to U.S. Bank.

:p Can U.S. Bank enforce payment of a note it does not physically possess?
??x
U.S. Bank cannot necessarily enforce payment if it did not physically possess and transfer the note. The key issue is whether U.S. Bank had constructive possession (exercised legal control) over the note, which would allow enforcement.

In U.S. Bank, N.A. v. Gaitan:
- Although U.S. Bank held the physical note, there was no evidence of a transfer or negotiation.
- Without legal ownership or control, U.S. Bank could not enforce payment.

??x
The answer is that without clear evidence of possession and transfer, U.S. Bank cannot enforce the note. Constructive possession (legal control) may be necessary for enforcement.
```java
// Pseudocode example to check constructive possession
public class NoteEnforcement {
    private boolean physicallyPossessed;
    private boolean constructivelyPossessed;

    public void setPhysicallyPossessed(boolean status) {
        physicallyPossessed = status;
    }

    public void setConstructivelyPossessed(boolean status) {
        constructivelyPossessed = status;
    }

    public boolean canEnforce() {
        return physicallyPossessed && constructivelyPossessed;
    }
}
```

#### Payable to Order or Bearer

**Background context:**
In the scenario involving Caraccia v. U.S. Bank, N.A., a key issue is whether a bank can enforce a bearer note (indorsed in blank) that it does not physically possess but has constructive possession over.

Caraccia signed a note and mortgage payable to VirtualBank, which then indorsed the note in blank and transferred it to U.S. Bank. U.S. Bank later sought to enforce the note by filing a suit against Caraccia.

:p Can a bank enforce payment on a bearer instrument if it does not physically possess it but has constructive possession?
??x
A bank can enforce a bearer instrument if it can prove constructive possession, even if it does not physically hold the instrument. Constructive possession means exercising legal control over the note in some other way (e.g., through electronic records or agreements).

In Caraccia v. U.S. Bank, N.A.:
- U.S. Bank had the physical note but argued they had constructive possession due to their relationship with VirtualBank.
- The court would need evidence that U.S. Bank had legal control over the note.

??x
The answer is that U.S. Bank could enforce payment if it can prove constructive possession, such as through agreements or electronic records showing legal control over the note.

```java
// Pseudocode example to check for constructive possession
public class NoteEnforcement {
    private boolean physicallyPossessed;
    private boolean constructivelyPossessed;

    public void setPhysicallyPossessed(boolean status) {
        physicallyPossessed = status;
    }

    public void setConstructivelyPossessed(boolean status) {
        constructivelyPossessed = status;
    }

    public boolean canEnforce() {
        return physicallyPossessed || (constructivelyPossessed && hasLegalControl());
    }

    private boolean hasLegalControl() {
        // Check for electronic records or agreements
        return true; // Placeholder logic
    }
}
```

#### Negotiating Order Instruments
Background context: An order instrument is an instrument that contains the name of a payee capable of indorsing, such as "Pay to the order of Jamie Fowler." The negotiation of an order instrument involves both delivery and indorsement. If only delivery occurs without indorsement, it is treated as an assignment instead.

:p What is required for negotiating an order instrument?
??x
Negotiating an order instrument requires both delivery and an indorsement. Without an indorsement, the transfer would be treated as an assignment.
x??

---
#### Example of Negotiating Order Instruments
Background context: The example provided involves Welpac Corporation issuing a payroll check "to the order of Elliot Goodseal." Goodseal takes the check to the bank, signs his name on the back (an indorsement), and gives it to the teller (a delivery).

:p What happens in this scenario?
??x
In this scenario, Goodseal negotiates the check by delivering it to the bank with an indorsement. The bank then becomes a holder of the instrument.
x??

---
#### Negotiating Bearer Instruments
Background context: A bearer instrument is payable to "cash" and can be negotiated by delivery alone without any indorsement. However, this method increases the risk of loss or theft.

:p How is a bearer instrument negotiated?
??x
A bearer instrument is negotiated solely through delivery into another person’s possession. Indorsement is not necessary for negotiation.
x??

---
#### Example of Negotiating Bearer Instruments
Background context: The example provided involves Alonzo Cruz writing a check payable to "cash." He then hands the check to Blaine Parrington, who later has it stolen.

:p What happens if the thief delivers the stolen check to an innocent third person?
??x
If the thief delivers the stolen check to an innocent third person, negotiation is complete. The third person gains all rights to the check, and Parrington loses any right to recover the proceeds from that person.
x??

---
#### Assignment vs. Negotiation of Instruments
Background context: An assignment transfers rights under a contract, while negotiation involves transferring an instrument in such form that the transferee becomes a holder. Assignments do not provide as many rights as negotiations.

:p What is the difference between an assignment and negotiation?
??x
An assignment transfers rights under a contract to another party, giving the assignee only those rights that the assignor possessed. A negotiation, however, makes the transferee a holder who receives at least the rights of the previous possessor, potentially more.
x??

---
#### Holder in Due Course (HDC)
Background context: A holder in due course is a person who receives an instrument by negotiation and has greater rights than a prior possessor. The Uniform Commercial Code provides that a holder becomes a holder in due course under certain conditions.

:p What defines a holder in due course?
??x
A holder in due course is a transferee who receives an instrument by negotiation and has all the rights of the previous possessor, plus potentially more if the transfer meets specific UCC criteria.
x??

---

---
#### Blank Indorsement and Special Indorsement
Background context: A blank indorsement, also known as a simple indorsement, is when someone signs their name on the back of a negotiable instrument without specifying the payee. This allows for the immediate transferability of the instrument to any holder in due course. However, if there's concern about losing the instrument, a special indorsement can be used.

Example: In this case, David Cohen signed his name on the back of a check—a blank indorsement—and negotiated it by delivering it to William Hunter. Hunter wanted to avoid risk and wrote "Pay to William Hunter" above Cohen’s signature, converting it into a special indorsement.
:p What is the difference between a blank indorsement and a special indorsement?
??x
A blank indorsement allows for immediate transferability of the instrument to any holder in due course without specifying the payee. A special indorsement, on the other hand, specifies who should receive the payment, thus requiring further negotiation (additional indorsements) by the new payee before it can be cashed.
x??

---
#### Conversion of a Blank Indorsement into a Special Indorsement
Background context: In the provided scenario, William Hunter wanted to secure his position as the recipient of the check and hence wrote "Pay to William Hunter" above Cohen’s blank indorsement. This converted the original blank indorsement into a special one, making further negotiation necessary by requiring Hunter's own indorsement.
:p How does converting a blank indorsement into a special indorsement affect future negotiations?
??x
Converting a blank indorsement into a special indorsement requires that any subsequent holder must also be the rightful owner of the instrument. Thus, Hunter now needs to indorse the check again before William can cash it.
x??

---
#### Holder in Due Course and Proof of Ownership
Background context: In this case, AS Peleus, LLC is trying to enforce a promissory note against Success, Inc., by initiating a foreclosure action. For a holder in due course (HDC) to enforce the note through foreclosure, they must produce the note with proper endorsements proving their ownership or holder status.

Relevant laws state that if an HDC produces a note endorsed specifically or to bearer, the court presumes they are the rightful owner of the debt. The defending party has the burden to prove otherwise by providing clear and convincing evidence.
:p What does AS Peleus, LLC need to do to enforce the promissory note?
??x
AS Peleus, LLC needs to produce the promissory note with proper endorsements demonstrating their status as a holder in due course. They must show that they are either specifically endorsed or have a blank endorsement to bearer.
x??

---
#### Presumption and Burden of Proof in Foreclosure Actions
Background context: The court found that AS Peleus, LLC had proven it was the owner and holder of the note through documents and testimony. However, Success, Inc., argued that there were gaps in the chain of title, which is not sufficient to rebut the presumption.

The law states that if an HDC produces a note with specific or bearer endorsements, they are presumed to be the rightful owner of the debt. The defending party must prove another party owns the debt by clear and convincing evidence.
:p How does the court handle the burden of proof in foreclosure actions?
??x
In foreclosure actions, if an HDC (such as AS Peleus, LLC) produces a note with proper endorsements demonstrating their ownership or holder status, the court presumes they are the rightful owner. The defending party (Success, Inc.) must provide clear and convincing evidence to prove another party owns the debt.
x??

---
#### Chain of Title and Documentary Lacunae
Background context: Success, Inc., argues that there were gaps in the chain of title, suggesting that someone else might be the rightful owner of the debt. However, according to court rulings, identifying a potential gap in the chain of title is not enough to rebut the presumption that an HDC is the rightful owner.

The court will only accept proof from the defending party if they can show clear and convincing evidence that another party owns the note and debt.
:p What does Success, Inc., need to prove regarding the chain of title?
??x
Success, Inc., needs to provide clear and convincing evidence proving that another party is the rightful owner of the note and debt. Simply identifying gaps in the chain of title is not sufficient to rebut the presumption that AS Peleus, LLC is the rightful owner.
x??

#### Payee Indorsements for Negotiation
Background context: When an instrument is payable to two or more persons, it may be ambiguous whether it is payable jointly or alternatively. According to UCC 3-110(d), if not clear, the instrument is payable alternatively, meaning only one of the payees’ indorsements is necessary for negotiation.
:p What happens when a negotiable instrument is payable to two or more persons but does not clearly indicate whether it's payable jointly or alternately?
??x
When an instrument is payable to multiple parties and does not specify "and/or," it defaults to being payable alternatively under UCC 3-110(d). This means only one of the payees needs to indorse for negotiation.
x??

---

#### Stacked Payees and Indorsements
Background context: If a check is made payable to two or more persons in stacked form (without "and" or "or"), it is considered ambiguous, making it payable alternatively. The checks require only one of the payees' indorsements for negotiation.
:p How are checks payable to stacked parties handled under UCC 3-110(d)?
??x
Checks made payable to stacked parties without an "and" or "or" between the names are ambiguous and thus payable alternatively. Only one of the payees needs to indorse for the check to be negotiable.
x??

---

#### Suspension of Drawer's Obligation
Background context: When a drawer issues a check to one alternative or joint payee, their obligation on the check to other payees is suspended until the check is either paid or dishonored. The holder of the check holds it for all payees' benefit.
:p What happens when a drawer gives a check to an alternative or joint payee?
??x
When a drawer issues a check to one alternative or joint payee, their obligation on the check to other payees is suspended until the check is either paid or dishonored. The holder of the check (the payee) holds it for all payees' benefit.
x??

---

#### Holder in Due Course (HDC)
Background context: The distinction between a regular holder and an HDC is crucial as an HDC has greater protection from defenses that could be asserted against the transferor. An ordinary holder obtains only those rights the transferor had, while an HDC takes the instrument free of most such claims.
:p What is the main difference between a regular holder and a holder in due course (HDC)?
??x
A regular holder obtains only the rights the transferor had, but they are subject to any defenses that could be asserted against the transferor. An HDC, on the other hand, takes an instrument free of most such defenses and claims, provided certain acquisition requirements are met.
x??

---

#### Case in Point 26.16 - Payees' Indorsements
Background context: In Hyatt Corporation's case, checks were made payable to J&D Financial Corporation and Skyscraper Building Maintenance. The bank negotiated the checks with only one indorsement from Skyscraper, leading to a lawsuit.
:p What was the outcome of the lawsuit filed by J&D and Hyatt against the bank?
??x
The court found that the bank was not liable as the checks were payable alternatively since the payees' names were stacked without "and/or." Therefore, only one indorsement from Skyscraper was sufficient for negotiation.
x??

---

#### Case in Point 26.17 - Suspension of Obligation
Background context: In the Vernon and Shirley Graves case, Westport Insurance issued checks co-payable to Johnson's Towing and Vernon Graves. The checks were delivered only to Graves, suspending Westport's obligation to the other payee.
:p How did the court rule in the lawsuit filed by the Graveses against Westport?
??x
The court ruled that once Westport sent the checks to one of the joint payees (Graves), its obligation to the other joint payee was suspended. Thus, Westport had complied with their agreement and was not liable.

#### Payee vs. Holder in Due Course
In this context, we are discussing a legal dispute where Conerly argues that Jarrell is not a holder in due course of promissory notes. The court finds merit to Conerly's argument based on the relationship and involvement between Jarrell and the business venture.
:p What does it mean for someone to be a "holder in due course" according to the text?
??x
A "holder in due course" (HDC) is typically defined as a holder of a negotiable instrument who has taken it without notice of any defenses or claims against it, and under circumstances that establish their right to hold the instrument free from such defenses.
In this case, the court emphasized that:
- A payee on a note is not automatically an HDC. 
- An isolated payee might qualify as an HDC if they do not have notices of defenses and dealt with the maker through an intermediary.
- However, in most instances, a direct deal between the payee and maker usually disqualifies the payee from being an HDC due to potential notice of defenses.

The court found that Jarrell is involved in the business venture, making him not a holder in due course:
```java
// Pseudocode representation of Jarrell's involvement
class BusinessVenture {
    String contract;
    
    // Contract details between Conerly and Jarrell
    public void formVenture(String ventureDetails) {
        this.contract = ventureDetails;
        System.out.println("Venture formed: " + contract);
    }
}
```
x??

---
#### Evidence of Defenses to the Notes
The text mentions that Conerly provided an affidavit with details about his interactions and agreements with Jarrell regarding the promissory notes. This evidence casts doubt on the consideration for the notes.
:p What specific information did Conerly's affidavit provide?
??x
Conerly's affidavit included several key points:
1. Conerly informed Jarrell that the mortgage on the Marion Property was at risk of default.
2. Conerly had previously spent significant funds to prevent foreclosure.
3. Conerly and Jarrell verbally agreed to secure the property by preventing a foreclosure, with Jarrell providing funds for this purpose.
4. The notes were signed as a formal record of each mortgage payment, reflecting Jarrell's personal investment in the business venture.
5. It was understood that the funds would be paid back through financing or profits from the venture, not personally from Conerly.

These points suggest that there may have been a failure of consideration, undermining the validity of the notes.
x??

---
#### Remand and Summary Judgment
The state intermediate appellate court reversed the lower court's summary judgment on this case. The decision was to remand it for further proceedings.
:p What does "remand" mean in legal terms?
??x
In legal terms, a "remand" means that an appeal court sends a case back to the lower court (or sometimes another lower court) for additional proceedings or a new trial. This occurs when the appellate court finds errors in the original decision.
In this context, the court's decision was:
```java
// Pseudocode representation of remand process
class CourtDecision {
    void reverseAndRemand() {
        System.out.println("Reversed lower court judgment and remanded for further proceedings.");
    }
}
```
The court decided to reverse the summary judgment in favor of Conerly, suggesting that there are still material facts that need to be resolved before a final decision can be made.
