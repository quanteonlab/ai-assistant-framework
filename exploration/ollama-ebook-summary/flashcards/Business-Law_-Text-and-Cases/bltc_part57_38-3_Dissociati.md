**Starting Chapter:** 38-3 Dissociation and Dissolution of an LLC

---

#### Dissociation and Dissolution of an LLC

Background context: Dissociation occurs when a member ceases to be associated with an LLC. Under the Uniform Limited Liability Company Act (ULLCA), similar events can trigger dissociation as those that cause partners to be dissociated in a partnership.

Key events triggering dissociation include:
- Voluntary withdrawal
- Expulsion by other members
- Court order
- Incompetence
- Bankruptcy
- Death

If a member dies or dissociates, the other members may continue to carry on the LLC business unless the operating agreement provides otherwise. 

:p What are the events that can trigger dissociation of an LLC member?
??x
The events include voluntary withdrawal, expulsion by other members, court order, incompetence, bankruptcy, and death.

#### Operating Agreement Responsibilities

Background context: The operating agreement defines the roles and responsibilities among members, including how distributions (like salaries and bonuses) are handled.

Key points from the text:
- The LLC’s responsibility to pay Schaefer wages and bonuses is clearly stated in the "Distributions" section.
- The "Profits" section also specifies that profits should first be allocated to Schaefer based on certain conditions.

:p According to the operating agreement, who is responsible for paying Schaefer's wages and bonuses?
??x
The LLC is responsible for paying Schaefer's wages and bonuses as per the "Distributions" section of the operating agreement.

#### Personal Liability in LLCs

Background context: The Wisconsin LLC statutes generally limit personal liability to acts or conduct outside a member’s capacity as a manager. 

Key points from the text:
- The LLC’s debts, obligations, and liabilities are solely those of the company itself.
- Members are not personally liable for these unless they act outside their managerial roles.

:p What does Wisconsin's LLC statute say about personal liability?
??x
Wisconsin's LLC statutes state that "the debts, obligations and liabilities of a limited liability company, whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise, shall be solely the debts, obligations and liabilities of the limited liability company." A member is not personally liable for any debt, obligation, or liability of the LLC unless they act outside their capacity as a member or manager.

#### Court Ruling on Personal Liability

Background context: In this case, Schaefer sued Orth in Wisconsin state court over unpaid wages and bonuses. The lower court ruled that Orth was not personally liable.

:p How did the court rule regarding Orth's personal liability?
??x
The court ruled that Orth is not personally liable to Schaefer for the payment of wages and bonuses as he acted within his capacity as a member or manager.
x??

---

#### Operating Agreement Clarity

Background context: The operating agreement clearly states that the LLC, not an individual member, is responsible for paying wages and bonuses.

Key points from the text:
- The "Distributions" section lists Schaefer's wages and bonuses as distributions to be paid first.
- The "Profits" section prioritizes allocation to Schaefer before other members.

:p According to the operating agreement’s language, who should pay Schaefer’s wages and bonuses?
??x
According to the operating agreement’s unambiguous language, the LLC should pay Schaefer's wages and bonuses as they are listed in the "Distributions" section.
x??

#### Code Example of Operating Agreement Clauses

Background context: The text references specific clauses from an operating agreement that detail responsibilities.

:p Provide a pseudocode example for the "Distributions" clause.
??x
```pseudocode
function allocateDistributions() {
    // First, pay Schaefer's wages and bonuses
    if (SchaeferWages + SchaeferBonuses <= LLCAvailableFunds) {
        paySchaefer(SchaeferWages);
        paySchaefer(SchaeferBonuses);
    } else {
        // Allocate remaining funds to other members proportionally
    }
}

function paySchaefer(amount) {
    LLCAvailableFunds -= amount;
}
```

This pseudocode demonstrates the logic for allocating Schaefer's wages and bonuses as per the operating agreement’s "Distributions" clause.

#### Winding Up of LLCs
Background context: When an LLC is dissolved, members who did not wrongfully dissociate may participate in the winding up process. The goal is to collect, liquidate, and distribute the LLC’s assets while preserving them for a reasonable time to optimize returns.

:p What are the key steps involved in winding up an LLC after dissolution?
??x
The key steps involve collecting all assets, liquidating these assets, and distributing the proceeds according to specific order. Members continue to have authority during this period, but debts must be paid first, followed by returning capital contributions and finally distributing any remaining amounts equally or as per the operating agreement.
x??

#### Special Business Forms
Background context: Beyond traditional LLCs and corporations, there are hybrid business forms like joint ventures, syndicates, joint stock companies, business trusts, and cooperatives. These combine elements of different organizational structures.

:p What is a key characteristic of special business forms?
??x
Special business forms combine features from other organizational forms such as partnerships and corporations, making them more flexible in structure and governance.
x??

---
#### Joint Venture
Background context: A joint venture involves two or more parties combining resources for specific transactions or projects. Profits and losses are shared equally unless otherwise specified.

:p How do joint venturers manage the project?
??x
Joint venturers typically have equal management rights to control the project, though they can agree to transfer control to one member.
x??

---
#### Liability in Joint Ventures
Background context: In a joint venture, members can be held personally liable for the venture’s debts due to shared responsibility for losses.

:p Can you provide an example of personal liability in a joint venture?
??x
Yes, if one venturer secretly acquires land intended for the joint venture without authorization, other venturers may seek damages for breach of loyalty and may also face legal actions for the company's debts.
x??

---
#### Authority to Enter into Contracts
Background context: Joint venturers have authority as agents to enter contracts that bind the joint venture. This is similar to partners in a partnership.

:p What does it mean when joint venturers are described as having "authority as agents"?
??x
It means that joint venturers can act on behalf of the joint venture to enter into binding agreements, just like partners in a partnership.
x??

---
#### Winding Up Process Overview
Background context: After an LLC's dissolution, members must handle the process by collecting and liquidating assets. They can hold these for a reasonable period to maximize returns.

:p What is the first step in winding up an LLC?
??x
The first step involves collecting all of the LLC’s assets. This ensures that there are no missing or overlooked items before proceeding with further actions.
x??

---
#### Distribution of Assets in Winding Up
Background context: After selling assets, funds must be distributed to creditors and members according to a specific order.

:p In what order should proceeds from asset sales be distributed?
??x
Proceeds should first go to paying off the LLC’s debts to creditors. Next, any remaining amounts are returned to the members’ capital contributions. Finally, any leftover funds are distributed equally among the members or according to their operating agreement.
x??

---
#### Joint Venture Taxation and Fiduciary Duties
Background context: A joint venture is taxed like a partnership and follows similar principles regarding fiduciary duties.

:p What fiduciary duty do joint venturers owe each other?
??x
Joint venturers owe each other the same fiduciary duties as partners, including the duty of loyalty. This means they must act in the best interest of the venture and avoid self-dealing.
x??

---
#### Management Rights in Joint Ventures
Background context: While joint venturers have equal rights to manage activities, they can agree on one person having control.

:p Can you explain how management rights are typically handled in a joint venture?
??x
Joint venturers generally have equal rights to manage the operations. However, they can agree to grant full or partial control to one member if desired.
x??

---

#### LLC Management and Operation
In an LLC, members have the flexibility to manage the business themselves or appoint managers. The operating agreement of the LLC governs how the firm will be managed. However, if no operating agreement is established, state laws often dictate default rules for management.

:p What are the options for managing Jeweled Watches, LLC with respect to Gabriel, Harris, and Ida?
??x
Gabriel, Harris, and Ida have several options regarding the management of their LLC:
1. **Self-Management**: They can manage the business themselves according to the terms set out in their operating agreement.
2. **Appointment of Managers**: They can appoint managers outside of themselves if specified in their operating agreement.

If no specific rules are established, they will follow state laws which often provide default management provisions. The operating agreement should be reviewed for detailed guidance on governance and management structure.

#### Business Trust
A business trust is a form of business organization where the owners (beneficiaries) have an interest in a legal entity that holds assets or manages businesses, but typically do not have direct control over day-to-day operations. Unlike corporations, business trusts are not separate legal entities; they rely on the underlying agreements.

:p What do Greener Delivery Company and Hiway Trucking, Inc., form with Insta Equipment Company and Jiffy Supply Corporation?
??x
Greener Delivery Company and Hiway Trucking, Inc., along with Insta Equipment Company and Jiffy Supply Corporation, form a business trust. This means that the underlying assets or businesses are held in a trust structure for the benefit of certain parties (the beneficiaries). The business trust is not a separate legal entity but relies on the terms agreed upon by the involved parties.

x??

---

#### Joint Stock Company
A joint stock company allows shareholders to purchase shares, which entitle them to ownership and profit distribution rights proportionate to their shareholdings. This form of business organization is often similar to corporations in terms of governance and financial structures.

:p What do Kwik Mart, Inc., and Luscious Produce, Inc., form with an incorporated cooperative?
??x
Kwik Mart, Inc., and Luscious Produce, Inc., form a joint stock company together. In this arrangement, shareholders (owners) of both companies can purchase shares in the new entity, entitling them to proportional ownership and profit distribution rights based on their shareholdings.

#### Special Business Forms
Special business forms like business trusts, joint stock companies, and cooperatives offer unique structures that may have different legal implications compared to traditional corporations. These forms often provide more flexibility in terms of management and ownership but can also come with specific advantages or limitations.

:p Discuss Bateson Corp.'s concern regarding the potential limits on liability when entering into contracts with a business trust and a joint stock company.
??x
Bateson Corp. is concerned about potential limits on liability because both the business trust and the joint stock company resemble corporations, which typically offer limited personal liability to shareholders. However, in the case of a business trust, the legal status might be different from that of a corporation since it is not a separate legal entity but relies on agreements.

In most states, corporate-like entities such as corporations provide strong protection against personal liability for shareholders. For the business trust and joint stock company:
- **Business Trust**: The trust structure does not necessarily offer the same level of limited liability as a corporation. If the trust is formed by individual sole proprietors, their personal assets could be at risk if the trust breaches the contract.
- **Joint Stock Company**: This form offers limited liability to shareholders similar to corporations.

To mitigate risks, Bateson should:
1. Review and understand the specific legal framework governing each entity.
2. Ensure that contracts include clauses protecting against potential liabilities.
3. Consider additional insurance policies to cover any gaps in liability protection.

#### Joint Venture
A joint venture is a temporary business arrangement where two or more parties agree to pool their resources, expertise, and capital to undertake a specific project or activity. It typically involves shared governance but can vary widely depending on the terms of the agreement.

:p What happened when Holiday entered into a "joint-venture agreement" with Rip Tosun?
??x
When Holiday Isle Resort & Marina, Inc., entered into a joint-venture agreement with Rip Tosun to operate a fifth restaurant called "Rip’s—A Place for Ribs," they agreed on terms that granted Rip full authority over the employees and business conduct. However, this agreement also included provisions preventing Tosun from competing without Holiday's approval but did not prevent Holiday from competing.

Later complications arose when:
- **Tosun Sold Half of His Interest**: Tosun sold half his interest in Rip’s to Thomas Hallock.
- **Holiday's Actions**: Holiday opened the Olde Florida Steakhouse next to Rip’s, which led to several issues including:
  - Stopping breakfast service at Rip’s
  - Diverting employees and equipment from Rip’s to the steakhouse
  - Offering breakfast services in the new restaurant

These actions could have violated the joint-venture agreement terms and potentially led to disputes.

#### Bluewater Logistics, LLC v. Williford (Jurisdictional Requirements)
Background: This case deals with jurisdictional requirements for diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1332. The relevant facts include Bluewater Logistics being a Mississippi LLC and Williford’s citizenship not specified.

:p Does the district court have diversity jurisdiction over Bluewater Logistics, LLC v. Williford?
??x
The district court does not necessarily have diversity jurisdiction because the plaintiff's citizenship (Bluewater Logistics, LLC) is not explicitly stated to be from a different state than the defendant. For diversity jurisdiction to exist, there must be complete diversity among all parties on both sides of the case.

For example:
- If Bluewater Logistics, LLC is incorporated in Mississippi and Williford’s citizenship is also Mississippi or involves any non-diverse party, then no diversity exists.
- Diversity would only apply if Bluewater Logistics, LLC is from a different state than Williford.

In this scenario, the court cannot exercise jurisdiction based on incomplete diversity without additional information about Williford's citizenship. 

```java
// Pseudo-code for checking diversity
public boolean hasCompleteDiversity(String plaintiffCitizenship, String defendantCitizenship) {
    return !plaintiffCitizenship.equals(defendantCitizenship);
}
```

#### Fadal Machining Centers v. Mid-Atlantic CNC (Jurisdictional Requirements)
Background: This case involves determining whether federal district court has diversity jurisdiction over a lawsuit between LLCs and corporations.

The relevant parties are:
- Fadal Machining Centers, LLC (Delaware LLC) - 10% owned by SP MAG Holdings (Delaware LLC with members including Silver Point Capital Fund and SPCP Group III).
- SP MAG Holdings (Delaware LLC)
- Silver Point Capital Fund (Delaware limited partnership)
- SPCP Group III (Delaware LLC)

The key member is Robert O’Shea, who is a New Jersey citizen.

:p Does the district court have diversity jurisdiction over Fadal Machining Centers v. Mid-Atlantic CNC?
??x
The district court may have diversity jurisdiction if all members of SP MAG Holdings are diverse from Mid-Atlantic CNC. Here’s the analysis:

1. **Fadal Machining Centers, LLC (Delaware)** - No specific state is mentioned.
2. **Mid-Atlantic CNC, Inc.** - New Jersey corporation.
3. **SP MAG Holdings (Delaware LLC)** - The members include:
   - Silver Point Capital Fund (Delaware limited partnership)
   - SPCP Group III (Delaware LLC)

Since the key member Robert O’Shea is a New Jersey citizen and SP MAG Holdings has multiple Delaware entities as its members, it is essential to check if all are diverse from Mid-Atlantic CNC.

Assuming that:
- Fadal Machining Centers, LLC is incorporated in a state other than New Jersey.
- All members of SP MAG Holdings (including Silver Point Capital Fund and SPCP Group III) have no common citizenship with Mid-Atlantic CNC.

Then, complete diversity exists, and the court has jurisdiction. However, if any member of SP MAG Holdings shares the same citizenship as Mid-Atlantic CNC, then there is incomplete diversity, and the court lacks jurisdiction.

```java
// Pseudo-code for checking diversity among LLC members
public boolean checkDiversity(String[] parties) {
    // Check each party's state and ensure no shared states.
    for (int i = 0; i < parties.length - 1; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < parties.length; j++) {
            if (parties[i].getState().equals(parties[j].getState())) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

#### Siloam Springs Hotel v. Century Surety Co. (Jurisdictional Requirements)
Background: This case involves determining whether federal district court has diversity jurisdiction over a dispute between an insurance company and a hotel.

The relevant parties are:
- **Siloam Springs Hotel, LLC** - Oklahoma corporation with Arkansas as its principal place of business.
- **Century Surety Company** - Ohio corporation with Michigan as its principal place of business.

The amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. 

:p Can the court exercise diversity jurisdiction over Siloam Springs Hotel v. Century Surety Co.?
??x
Yes, the court can exercise diversity jurisdiction because there is complete diversity among the parties involved:

1. **Siloam Springs Hotel, LLC** - Oklahoma corporation.
2. **Century Surety Company** - Ohio corporation.

Since the two corporations are from different states and there is no common citizenship or ownership between them, complete diversity exists. Therefore, federal district court has jurisdiction based on 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a).

```java
// Pseudo-code for checking diversity among parties
public boolean checkCompleteDiversity(String party1, String party2) {
    // Check if the states of both parties are different.
    return !party1.equals(party2);
}
```

#### Norman v. Crow Wing Cooperative Power & Light Co. (Special Business Forms)
Background: This case involves determining whether members of a member-owned electrical cooperative can be held jointly liable for the cooperative's acts.

The key facts include:
- **Norman** - Plaintiffs who operate a dairy farm in Pine River, Minnesota.
- **Crow Wing Cooperative Power & Light Company** - A member-owned electrical cooperative that provided electricity to Norman’s farm.

:p Can the members of Crow Wing Cooperative be held jointly liable for its acts?
??x
Yes, the members of a member-owned cooperative can be held jointly liable for the cooperative's acts if it is established that their actions were negligent and caused harm. In this case:

1. **Crow Wing Cooperative Power & Light Co.** - Member-owned electrical cooperative.
2. **Norman v. Crow Wing Cooperative Power & Light Co., 2016 WL 687472 (Minn.App. 2016)** - The court found that the members could be held jointly liable for their negligence.

The rationale behind this is based on the doctrine of piercing the corporate veil, which allows for individual liability when the corporation’s acts are attributable to the individuals due to their actions or omissions. In this scenario, if the evidence shows that stray electrical voltage was a result of negligent actions by specific members, those members could be held jointly liable.

```java
// Pseudo-code for checking member liability
public boolean canMembersBeHeldLiable(String[] members, String negligence) {
    // Check if any member's negligence is directly linked to the incident.
    for (String member : members) {
        if (member.isNegligent(negligence)) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```
