#### Trade Names

??x
A trade name indicates part or all of a business’s name. It can be protected as a trademark if it's also the company’s trademarked product—for example, Coca-Cola.

#### Licensing
Background context: A license allows one party to use another’s intellectual property rights for specific purposes in exchange for fees. Disputes often arise over licensing agreements, especially those involving Internet uses.

:p What is a license agreement and how does it work?
??x
A license is an agreement that permits the use of a trademark, copyright, patent, or trade secret for certain purposes. The party owning the intellectual property rights (licensor) issues the license to another party (licensee), who pays fees (royalties) for the privilege. A license grants only the rights expressly described in the agreement. For example, the licensor might allow the licensee to use a trademark in its company or domain name but not on any products or services.
