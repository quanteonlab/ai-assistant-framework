**Starting Chapter:** 13-1 Elements of Consideration

---

---
#### Bilateral Contracts and Consideration
Background context explaining bilateral contracts. In such agreements, both parties exchange promises, creating a mutual obligation. Each promise serves as consideration for the other party’s promise.

:p What is considered "consideration" in a bilateral contract?
??x
Consideration in a bilateral contract consists of a promise by one party in exchange for a promise by another party. Both promises must have legally sufficient value and be part of a bargained-for exchange.
x??

---
#### Unilateral Contracts and Consideration
Background context explaining unilateral contracts, which involve a single party making a promise in return for the other party’s performance of an action.

:p What is an example of consideration in a unilateral contract?
??x
In a unilateral contract, the performance by the other party constitutes consideration. For instance, if Anita says to her neighbor, "When you finish painting the garage, I will pay you $800," the act of painting the garage is the consideration that creates Anita’s obligation.

---
#### Consideration and Forbearance
Background context explaining how forbearance can serve as consideration. The example provided discusses a case where someone refrains from performing an action (forbearance) to fulfill their part of the contract.

:p Can forbearance constitute legally sufficient consideration?
??x
Yes, forbearance can be considered legally sufficient consideration if it involves the performance of an action that one has a legal right to undertake. For instance, in Hamer v. Sidway, William E. Story II promised his uncle $5,000 if he refrained from certain harmful habits.

#### Elements of Consideration
Background context on the two parts that make up consideration: something of legally sufficient value and a bargained-for exchange.

:p What are the two main components of consideration?
??x
The two main components of consideration are:
1. Something of legally sufficient value must be given in return for the promise.
2. There must be a bargained-for exchange, meaning both parties agree to exchange promises or performances.
x??

---
#### Forcibility and Consideration
Background context on how courts generally do not interfere with contracts based on the amount of consideration paid but focus on whether there is legally sufficient value in the agreement.

:p What does the court's stance regarding consideration imply?
??x
Courts typically do not consider the amount of consideration when deciding the enforceability of a contract, as long as it has legally sufficient value. The focus is on ensuring that both parties have agreed to exchange something valuable for each other’s promises or performances.

---
#### When Voluntary Consent May Be Lacking
Background context: This concept addresses situations where a contract might be deemed invalid due to issues with voluntary consent, particularly when there is a significant disparity in the value exchanged or when consideration is inadequate.

:p What happens if people could sue for entering into unwise contracts?
??x If people could sue merely because they had entered into an unwise contract, courts would be overloaded with frivolous suits.
x??

---
#### Shockingly Inadequate Consideration
Background context: A significant disparity in the value exchanged can raise questions about whether fraud, duress, or undue influence was involved. This concept highlights that a contract may lack valid consideration if it involves shockingly inadequate consideration.

:p What might happen if Spencer pays $1,000 for an iPhone later found to be counterfeit?
??x Because the device is not authentic, he could claim that there was no valid contract because of inadequate consideration and fraud.
x??

---
#### Disparity in Consideration Exchanged
Background context: When there is a large disparity in the amount or value of the consideration exchanged, it may raise concerns about unconscionability. A judge might scrutinize such contracts to ensure they are fair.

:p How can a contract be deemed "unconscionable"?
??x A contract can be deemed "unconscionable" if the disparity in the consideration is so one-sided and unfair that it raises questions of fairness, which courts may consider unenforceable.
x??

---
#### Agreements That Lack Consideration
Background context: This concept explains scenarios where parties might believe they have exchanged consideration when in fact, they have not. It covers situations like a preexisting duty or unforeseen difficulties.

:p What happens if one party has a legal obligation to perform an act already?
??x Under most circumstances, a promise to do what one already has a legal duty to do does not constitute legally sufficient consideration.
x??

---
#### Preexisting Duty
Background context: A key aspect of this concept is that promises or actions based on preexisting duties are generally not considered valid consideration. For example, a sheriff cannot collect a reward for providing information leading to the capture of a criminal.

:p What agreement in Example 13.4 is unenforceable?
??x The agreement between Ajax Contractors and the owner of the land is unenforceable because it lacks legally sufficient consideration; Ajax Contractors had a preexisting contractual duty to complete the building.
x??

---
#### Unforeseen Difficulties
Background context: This concept addresses how extraordinary difficulties during contract performance can sometimes justify additional payment, but not if the party already has a preexisting duty or obligation.

:p What agreement in Example 13.4 is unenforceable?
??(Duplicate question from above) The agreement between Ajax Contractors and the owner of the land is unenforceable because it lacks legally sufficient consideration; Ajax Contractors had a preexisting contractual duty to complete the building.

#### Consideration Concept Summary
Background context: This section provides an overview of what constitutes "consideration" in contract law. It explains that consideration must be something of legally sufficient value given in exchange for a promise.

:p What is required for valid consideration in a contract?
??x For valid consideration, there must be something of legally sufficient value given in exchange for a promise, which may consist of a promise, performance, or forbearance.

#### Notice Period in Contracts
Background context: In contracts, providing notice of termination is a common clause that can create enforceable claims. The example given involves Abe giving Chris thirty days' notice, which affects Chris's salary claim.

:p What is the legal implication of Abe giving Chris thirty days' notice?
??x
Abe's promise to give Chris thirty days' notice is not illusory because it involves a relinquishment of the right to terminate immediately. This means if Chris works for one month and then Abe gives him thirty days' notice, Chris has an enforceable claim for two months’ salary ($10,000).

Example:
```plaintext
If Chris works for 30 days (one month) and then gets a 30-day notice,
he is entitled to the remaining 30 days' worth of his $500/day salary.
Total: 30 days * $500 =$15,000. However, since the contract only promised$10,000 for one month (30 days), Chris can claim that amount as enforceable.
```

#### Requirements and Output Contracts
Background context: These contracts deal with uncertain performance where a buyer agrees to purchase goods based on their needs or what a seller produces.

:p What are the two main types of contracts discussed in this section, and how do they differ?
??x
The two main types of contracts discussed are requirements contracts and output contracts. In a **requirements contract**, the buyer agrees to purchase from the seller all the goods needed by the buyer. In an **output contract**, the buyer agrees to purchase whatever the seller produces.

Example:
```plaintext
Requirements Contract: Buyer A needs 100 widgets per month. Seller B will supply these widgets as needed.
Output Contract: Seller B will produce any amount of widgets, and Buyer A will purchase all produced widgets.
```

#### Accords and Satisfaction
Background context: This is a method for settling claims where one party agrees to pay less than the original debt in exchange for the other party's acceptance.

:p How does an accord and satisfaction work?
??x
In an **accord and satisfaction**, a debtor offers to pay a lesser amount, and a creditor accepts it. The agreement (accord) outlines this offer and performance (satisfaction). For example:

Example:
```plaintext
Barbara Kwan agrees to pay $120 per month for two years at 5% interest.
She owes the bank a total of $34,800. Later, she offers to settle with$32,000,
and the bank accepts this offer.

Accord: Barbara will pay $32,000.
Satisfaction: The bank will accept $32,000 instead of the full amount.
```

#### Liquidated Debts
Background context: A debt is liquidated if its exact amount has been determined. Accord and satisfaction cannot be used in such cases because the debt's amount is not disputed.

:p What happens when a debt is liquidated?
??x
A **liquidated debt** is one whose amount has already been agreed upon or fixed, making it impossible to settle through accord and satisfaction. For example:

Example:
```plaintext
Barbara Kwan signs an installment loan contract for $34,800 at 5% interest.
Both parties know the total obligation before signing.

If Barbara offers $32,000 to satisfy the debt, but it is a liquidated debt,
the bank cannot accept this offer as satisfaction because the amount
was already determined and cannot be renegotiated.
```
x??

#### Past Consideration
Background context: A promise made in exchange for past actions or events does not constitute valid consideration.

:p What happens when a person makes a promise based on past actions?
??x
When a person makes a promise in return for actions that have already taken place, there is no consideration. For instance:

Example:
```plaintext
If John promised to paint Sarah's house and she paid him $500,
and later, Sarah asks John to fix the fence and offers $100 as payment,
John cannot accept this because his original promise was made in exchange for past actions (painting),
not future ones.

There is no new consideration since the painting has already been done.
```
