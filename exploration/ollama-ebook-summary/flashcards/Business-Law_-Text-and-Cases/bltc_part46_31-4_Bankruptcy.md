**Starting Chapter:** 31-4 Bankruptcy Relief under Chapter 12 and Chapter 13

---

---
#### Filing of the Plan by an Individual Debtor
Background context: The Bankruptcy Code requires individual debtors to file a plan within 120 days after the order for relief, which can be extended up to eighteen months. For small-business debtors, this period is 180 days if they choose to avoid a creditors’ committee.

:p What is the deadline for an individual debtor to file a plan?
??x
The deadline for an individual debtor to file a plan is within 120 days after the order for relief, which can be extended up to eighteen months. If not met or extended, any party may propose a plan.
??x

---
#### Plan Acceptance and Modification
Background context: Once developed, the plan must be submitted to each class of creditors for acceptance. For small-business debtors, if the debtor fails to procure creditor consent within 180 days, the court must confirm the plan unless there is an objection.

:p What happens if a small-business debtor fails to obtain creditor consent within 180 days?
??x
If a small-business debtor fails to obtain creditor consent within 180 days, the court must confirm the plan, provided it meets all other requirements.
??x

---
#### Confirmation of the Plan for Individual Debtors
Background context: The plan can be confirmed if it does not discriminate unfairly against any creditors and is fair and equitable. For individual debtors, the court may still confirm a plan under the cram-down provision even if only one class accepts it.

:p Under what circumstances can the court confirm an individual debtor's plan?
??x
The court can confirm an individual debtor's plan if:
1. All postpetition domestic-support obligations have been paid in full.
2. The plan is not unfair to any creditors and is fair and equitable.
3. Even if only one class of creditors accepts the plan, under the cram-down provision.
??x

---
#### Discharge for Individual Debtors
Background context: Confirmation of a plan does not discharge an individual debtor unless the plan is completed. For all other debtors, the court may order discharge at any time after confirmation.

:p What must be done before an individual debtor can receive discharge?
??x
Before an individual debtor can receive discharge, the plan must be completed as required by the Bankruptcy Code.
??x

---
#### Discharge for Other Debtors
Background context: For other debtors (e.g., small-businesses), the court may order a discharge at any time after confirmation of the plan. The discharge is from all claims not protected under the plan, except those denied discharge in liquidation.

:p Under what conditions can the court grant a discharge to non-individual debtors?
??x
The court can grant a discharge to non-individual debtors (e.g., small-businesses) at any time after confirmation of the plan. The discharge covers all claims not protected by the plan, excluding those denied in liquidation.
??x

#### Repayment Plan Overview
This section outlines the essential components of a Chapter 13 repayment plan, including the turnover of future earnings, payment of priority claims like taxes, and the identical treatment of similar claims. It also covers the debtor's obligation to begin making payments within thirty days and the consequences if they fail.

:p What are the key components required in a Chapter 13 repayment plan?
??x
The key components required in a Chapter 13 repayment plan include:
1. The turning over of future earnings or income necessary for execution.
2. Full payment through deferred cash payments of all claims entitled to priority, such as taxes.
3. Identical treatment of all claims within the same class.

Additionally, the debtor must begin making timely payments within thirty days after filing and continue doing so. Failure to do so can result in conversion to Chapter 7 or dismissal of the petition.

---
#### Allowable Expenses
The means test is applied by a debtor to determine disposable income available for repayment. Certain expenses are deductible, but they must be appropriate and applicable during the life of the plan. For example, a car-ownership allowance can only be claimed if the debtor will incur that expense during the term of the Chapter 13 plan.

:p Can unsecured creditors object to a Chapter 13 plan?
??x
Yes, unsecured creditors can object to a Chapter 13 plan. In such cases, as seen with Jason Ransom's case, FIA Card Services objected because they argued that Ransom was not entitled to the car-ownership allowance since he did not owe money on the car.

Ultimately, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of FIA, stating that deductions are appropriate only if the debtor will incur those expenses during the life of the Chapter 13 plan. A debtor who does not make loan or lease payments may not claim a car-ownership deduction.

x??
---

---
#### Length of the Payment Plan
The duration of a Chapter 13 payment plan can be either three or five years, depending on the debtor's family income relative to the median family income in their geographic area. If the family income is greater than the median, the term must be three years.

:p What determines the length of the payment plan?
??x
The length of a Chapter 13 payment plan is determined by comparing the debtor's family income to the median family income in their geographic area under the means test. If the family income exceeds the median, the term of the proposed plan must be three years.

#### Tina's Bankruptcy Petition
Tina has just graduated from college and is working as a salesperson. She decides to file for bankruptcy, listing her debts which include student loans, taxes accruing within the last year, and a claim against her based on misuse of customers' funds during her employment.
:p Are all these debts dischargeable in bankruptcy?
??x
In Chapter 7 bankruptcy, most unsecured debts such as credit card debt, medical bills, and personal loans are typically discharged. However, student loans, taxes, and debts related to misappropriation of funds (such as customer funds) are generally not dischargeable. Therefore:
- **Student Loans**: Generally not dischargeable unless there is a very specific circumstance like undue hardship.
- **Taxes Acing within the Last Year**: Usually not discharged if they have been assessed by the IRS or other taxing authority and are still collectible at the time of filing bankruptcy.
- **Claim Based on Misuse of Customers' Funds**: Likely not dischargeable as it involves a fraudulent act.

#### Ogden's Loan Recovery
Ogden is a vice president of Plumbing Service, Inc. (PSI). He loans PSI $10,000 on May 1 and the firm repays it on June 1 before filing for bankruptcy on July 1.
:p Can Quentin, appointed trustee, recover the $10,000 paid to Ogden?
??x
In liquidation proceedings, the trustee can attempt to recover preferential transfers (payments made within a certain period before bankruptcy) and fraudulent conveyances. The timing of Ogden's repayment is crucial:
- If the loan was repaid on June 1 and PSI filed for bankruptcy on July 1, it could be considered a preferential transfer as it was paid relatively close to filing.
- The trustee may argue that this payment was made with an intent to hinder creditors or avoid paying debts.
However, the exact recoverability depends on whether Ogden's repayment fits within the preference period (usually 90 days before bankruptcy) and whether it can be proven that the payment was intended as a preferential transfer.

#### Burke’s Voluntary Bankruptcy
Burke is a rancher with a $500,000 ranch valued nearly entirely in exempt property. She has eight creditors totaling $70,000 in debt.
:p Can Burke voluntarily petition into bankruptcy?
??x
Under the Bankruptcy Code, a debtor can file for voluntary bankruptcy if they meet certain criteria:
- The value of non-exempt assets must be sufficient to cover unsecured debts: In this case, Burke’s total debt is $70,000 and her ranch (with most property exempt) might only have about $50,000 in non-exempt value.
- There must be a clear inability to pay the debts as they come due. Given that she cannot currently meet her obligations, this criterion may also be met.
Therefore, Burke can potentially file for voluntary bankruptcy if her non-exempt assets are insufficient to cover her debt and there is an inability to repay.
x??

---
#### Burke’s Involuntary Bankruptcy
Continuing with the same scenario as above, Burke has eight creditors totaling $70,000 in debt. Two of them (Oman and Sneed) hold significant claims of $30,000 and $25,000 respectively.
:p Can either Oman or Sneed force Burke into involuntary bankruptcy?
??x
An involuntary bankruptcy petition can be filed by a creditor if the debtor has more than $75,000 in debts. Given that:
- Burke’s total debt is $70,000 and she cannot pay it.
- Both Oman ($30,000) and Sneed ($25,000) have significant claims but not enough individually to force an involuntary bankruptcy on their own.
Therefore, neither Oman nor Sneed can independently file for an involuntary bankruptcy. However, if they join forces with other creditors whose total claims exceed $75,000, they could potentially file a joint petition.

#### Montoro’s Distribution of Property
Montoro petitioned into voluntary bankruptcy and had three major claims against his estate: one from Carlton ($2,500), another from Elmer ($4,500 for back wages), and the last from the United Bank of the Rockies ($5,000 unsecured loan).
:p What amount will each party receive in distribution?
??x
In a bankruptcy liquidation process:
- **Carlton**: Holds a negotiable promissory note. This is a secured claim.
- **Elmer**: Claims back wages; an employee may have a preference claim (unsecured but prioritized over other unsecured claims).
- **United Bank of the Rockies**: Unsecured loan holder.
- Non-exempt property was liquidated for $5,000.

The distribution order generally follows:
1. Secured creditors first: Carlton’s $2,500 is covered entirely by the proceeds.
2. Employee preference claims next: Elmer gets up to 75% of his claim (3 months’ back wages = $4,500; 75% of $4,500 = $3,375).
3. Remaining funds are distributed to unsecured creditors.

Thus:
- Carlton: $2,500
- Elmer: $3,375 (75% of his claim)
- United Bank of the Rockies: $(1,125) (remaining $5,000 - $2,500 - $3,375)

The total distribution amounts to:
```java
public class DistributionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int totalProceeds = 5000;
        int carltonClaim = 2500; // Secured claim
        double elmerClaim = 4500 * 0.75; // Employee preference claim (75%)
        int unitedBankClaim = totalProceeds - carltonClaim - (int)elmerClaim;
        System.out.println("Carlton: " + carltonClaim);
        System.out.println("Elmer: " + elmerClaim);
        System.out.println("United Bank of the Rockies: " + unitedBankClaim);
    }
}
```

#### Caroline McAfee’s Guaranty Discharge
Caroline McAfee loaned $400,000 to Carter Oaks Crossing. Joseph Harman, president of Carter Oaks Crossing, signed a personal guaranty for this note, agreeing to repay the amount with interest.
:p Would the obligation under the guaranty have been discharged in bankruptcy?
??x
In Chapter 7 bankruptcy, most unsecured debts and guarantees are discharged if:
- The bankruptcy petition was filed after the note but before default occurred.
- The guarantee is not listed as a debt in the bankruptcy filing.

Given that:
- Harman signed a personal guaranty for McAfee's loan, which was not mentioned in his bankruptcy petition.
- Harman’s bankruptcy filing came after 1999 but before the default on the note (involving 2006).

Since the guaranty was not listed and the bankruptcy was filed within the time frame prior to default:
- The obligation under the guaranty would likely NOT have been discharged in bankruptcy.

#### Discharge of Domestic-Support Obligations under Chapter 13
Background context: The case of In re Shankle, 554 Fed.Appx. 264 (5th Cir. 2014) involves James Thomas and Jennifer Clark who had domestic support obligations as part of their divorce decree. These obligations included making equal payments on a second mortgage and paying the first mortgage after the divorce.
:p Is it possible for James Thomas to discharge his debt related to the mortgages in Chapter 13 bankruptcy?
??x
In this case, Clark argued that the debts should not be discharged because they were part of her husband's domestic support obligations. The court must decide whether these obligations are dischargeable under Chapter 13.
If the court determines that a significant portion of the debt is related to domestic support (like alimony or child support), it may be non-dischargeable.

For example, if Thomas failed to make payments on the mortgages and Clark used bankruptcy to resolve those debts, the court might consider whether these were primarily for domestic support.
??x
In Chapter 13, certain types of debt are not dischargeable even after filing a bankruptcy petition. These include most domestic support obligations, such as alimony or child support. If the debt in question is primarily related to supporting a spouse and/or children, it may be non-dischargeable.

For instance:
```java
if (debtCategory == "Domestic Support") {
    // Debt will not be discharged
}
```

#### Dismissal of Bankruptcy Petition for Fraudulent Behavior
Background context: In re Thomas, 591 Fed.Appx. 443 (6th Cir. 2015) discusses Jeffrey Krueger and Michael Torres who were involved in a dispute over Cru Energy, Inc., and Krueger's fraudulent behavior to delay legal proceedings by filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.
:p Does the bankruptcy court have grounds to dismiss Krueger’s bankruptcy petition?
??x
The bankruptcy court could dismiss Krueger's bankruptcy petition if it finds that he engaged in fraud or abuse. Specifically, ignoring the transfer of ownership from Cru Energy to the bankruptcy trustee and holding fraudulent meetings with shareholders without disclosing his interests could be considered abusive behavior.
If the bankruptcy court determines that Krueger's actions were fraudulent, it can dismiss the case.

For example:
```java
if (fraudulentBehaviorDetected) {
    // Dismiss the bankruptcy petition
}
```

#### Confirmation Requirement of Chapter 11 Plan
Background context: In re Krueger, 812 F.3d 365 (5th Cir. 2016) addresses Transwest Resort Properties, Inc., which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy with a joint reorganization plan. The key issue is whether the requirement that at least one class of creditors must accept a plan applies on a "per debtor" or "per plan" basis.
:p Does the bankruptcy court have grounds to reject the confirmation of Transwest Resort's reorganization plan?
??x
The bankruptcy court would need to determine if the reorganization plan met the confirmation requirements. Specifically, under the plain language of the Bankruptcy Code, at least one class of creditors must accept a Chapter 11 plan for it to be confirmed.

In this case, Grasslawn Lodging, LLC, objected because it was the only claimant for two of the debtors and did not agree to the plan. If the court rules that the confirmation requirement applies on a "per debtor" basis, then the plan may fail as no class accepted the plan for those two companies.

For example:
```java
if (!anyClassAcceptedPlan) {
    // Reject the confirmation
}
```

#### Agency Relationships Overview
Agency relationships exist between principals and agents. These relationships are crucial for businesses as they enable a principal to conduct operations through an agent, often allowing for broader reach and control over third parties.

A key aspect of agency law is that employees who deal with third parties are generally deemed to be agents of their employers. This means any actions or representations made by these employees on behalf of the employer can bind the employer to those actions or statements.

:p What defines an agency relationship?
??x
An agency relationship arises when one party (the agent) agrees to act on behalf and subject to control of another party (the principal). The agent conducts business with third parties as per the principal's instructions, and any actions taken by the agent can be legally binding on the principal.
x??

---

#### Fiduciary Duty in Agency Law
The term "fiduciary" is central to agency law. A fiduciary has a duty to act primarily for another’s benefit in matters connected with their undertaking.

:p What does the term "fiduciary" refer to in agency law?
??x
In agency law, a fiduciary refers to a person who undertakes to act on behalf of and instead of another. This person has a duty to act primarily for the benefit of the principal (the party they represent). When used as an adjective, "fiduciary" describes a relationship involving trust and confidence.
x??

---

#### Manifestation of Consent
Agency relationships are formed through a manifestation of consent. One party consents to another acting on their behalf, and that other party agrees to act in this capacity.

:p How is an agency relationship typically established?
??x
An agency relationship is usually established when one party (the principal) manifests consent for another party (the agent) to act on their behalf. This manifestation can be explicit or implied through actions. The key aspect is the control and representation agreement between the principal and the agent.
x??

---

#### Corporate Officers as Agents
Corporate officers are agents who represent a corporation in various business dealings. They have the authority to bind the corporation to contracts, making them crucial for corporate operations.

:p What role do corporate officers play in agency law?
??x
Corporate officers serve as agents for their corporations. They have the authority to act on behalf of the corporation and can enter into binding contracts with third parties. This means that any action taken by a corporate officer within the scope of their authority is legally binding on the corporation.
x??

---

#### Overlap Between Agency Law and Employment Law
Agency law often overlaps with employment law, especially concerning employees who interact with third parties.

:p How do agency relationships overlap with employment law?
??x
Agency law and employment law frequently overlap because many employees who deal with third parties are considered agents of their employers. This means that actions taken by these employees can bind the employer legally. However, not all agency relationships exist within an employment context; some independent contractors can also be agents.
x??

---

#### Restatement (Third) of Agency
The Restatement (Third) of Agency provides authoritative guidance on agency law and is often referenced in legal decisions.

:p What does the Restatement (Third) of Agency cover?
??x
The Restatement (Third) of Agency offers a comprehensive summary of agency law principles. It defines an agency relationship as the fiduciary relation that results from one party's consent for another to act on their behalf and subject to control, coupled with the other party’s agreement to act in this capacity.
x??

---

#### Example of Agency Law Application
A salesperson in a department store is an agent of the store owner. Any actions taken by the salesperson while representing the store are binding on the owner.

:p How does agency law apply in a retail setting?
??x
In a retail setting, a salesperson acting as an agent for a store’s owner can bind the store to any sale or representations made to customers. For instance, if a customer purchases goods from a salesperson and the store later disputes this transaction, it will be bound by the sale due to the agency relationship.
x??

---

#### Independent Contractors as Agents
Independent contractors hired by employers to perform special tasks may also establish an agency relationship.

:p Can independent contractors form agency relationships with their employers?
??x
Yes, independent contractors can form agency relationships with their employers. If they are hired to perform specific tasks and act on behalf of the employer in dealings with third parties, they can be considered agents. This means that actions or representations made by them may bind the employer.

#### Categorization of Workers and Labor Law
Background context: In the United States, workers are generally classified as either employees or independent contractors. Employment laws such as minimum wage and anti-discrimination statutes cover employees but not most independent contractors. The rise of digital platforms like Uber and Lyft has introduced a new category of "on-demand" workers who choose their work schedules through apps but do not have the flexibility to negotiate terms.
:p How are workers in the United States generally categorized, and what distinguishes employment from independent contractor status?
??x
Workers in the United States can be broadly classified into two categories: employees and independent contractors. Employees are covered by various labor laws that include minimum wage protections and anti-discrimination statutes, while independent contractors typically do not receive these protections. On-demand workers like those for Uber or Lyft choose their work schedules but must accept the terms set by the platform.
x??

---
#### Legal Status of Uber and Lyft Drivers
Background context: With the rise of companies like Uber and Lyft, there has been a debate on whether drivers should be classified as employees or independent contractors. This classification affects the legal protections they receive and the benefits they are entitled to. Lawsuits have been filed by drivers seeking better treatment.
:p What is the primary issue in lawsuits against Uber and Lyft regarding their workers?
??x
The primary issue in these lawsuits revolves around the legal status of Uber and Lyft drivers—whether they should be classified as employees or independent contractors. This classification determines whether they are entitled to employee benefits such as minimum wage, health insurance, and protection under labor laws.
x??

---
#### Impact of Legal Rulings on Uber and Lyft
Background context: In New Jersey, a court ruled that Pershad was an employee of Five Star but not AAA, meaning AAA could not be held liable for any torts committed by Five Star. Similarly, Uber and Lyft drivers have faced legal challenges where they have sued the companies claiming misclassification.
:p How did the court ruling in Coker v. Pershad affect AAA’s liability?
??x
The court ruling in Coker v. Pershad determined that since Five Star was an independent contractor for AAA and not an employee, AAA could not be held liable for any torts committed by Five Star's employees. This distinction is crucial because it clarifies the legal responsibilities between companies like AAA and their business partners.
x??

---
#### Current Status of Uber and Lyft in California
Background context: In California, there have been court rulings allowing separate lawsuits to go before juries on whether Uber and Lyft drivers should be considered employees rather than independent contractors. This has led to a reevaluation of the current legal status and potential changes in how these companies operate.
:p How are Uber and Lyft drivers currently classified in California?
??x
Uber and Lyft drivers in California have been classified as independent contractors, which means they do not receive many of the protections afforded to employees under labor laws. This classification has led to numerous lawsuits where drivers seek reclassification as employees to gain better benefits and protections.
x??

---
#### Impact of Worker Misclassification Lawsuits on Companies
Background context: Due to legal challenges over worker misclassification, companies like Uber and Lyft have faced lawsuits and settlements that require them to change their terms of service. These changes are aimed at providing more protection and fair treatment for their drivers while avoiding further legal troubles.
:p What actions did Lyft take after a worker misclassification lawsuit?
??x
Lyft took action by settling a worker misclassification lawsuit for $12.25 million, agreeing to modify its terms of service to comply with California’s independent contractor status regulations. This settlement included changes such as prohibiting the deactivation of drivers' accounts without reason and ensuring fair hearings before any actions are taken.
