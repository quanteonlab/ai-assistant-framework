#### Concept: Types of Collateral and Methods of Perfection
This section details various types of collateral that can be used as security interests, including personal property, real estate, financial accounts, and more. Different methods are used to perfect these security interests depending on the type of asset.

:p What is a purchase-money security interest (PMSI) in consumer goods?
??x
A purchase-money security interest (PMSI) in consumer goods is a security interest granted when financing or paying for a good at the time of its purchase. This typically covers items like home theatre systems, furniture, etc., bought primarily for personal use.

Example: If someone buys a home theatre system on credit, the creditor has a PMSI in that item.

#### Concept: Equipment as Collateral
Equipment is defined as movable property or assets attached to land at the time of security interest attachment. Examples include delivery trucks, machinery, and other physical items.

:p How can a secured party perfect a security interest in equipment?
??x
A security interest in equipment is typically perfected by filing a financing statement. If the equipment is not titled (like a car), then possession might be necessary to perfect the security interest.

Example: If a company leases machinery, it should file a financing statement with the relevant state.
x??

---
#### Concept: Accounts as Collateral
Accounts represent various financial accounts maintained with banks or other institutions, such as demand, time, savings, passbook, and similar accounts. These can also include intellectual property licenses, insurance policies, and certain receivables.

:p What method of perfection is used for accounts?
??x
For most accounts, filing a financing statement is required to perfect the security interest. However, in some cases, control over the account (where the secured party is the bank) or agreement between parties can also provide perfection.

Example: If a company has a line of credit with a bank, filing might be sufficient, but if the account is under another institution, additional steps may be needed.

#### Concept: Chattel Paper as Collateral
Chattel paper refers to non-physical property that exists only in connection with something else. This can include invoices or notes receivable.

:p How does chattel paper get perfected?
??x
Chattel paper is typically perfected by filing a financing statement. The secured party needs to file the document to provide notice of their interest in the collateral.

Example: If a company has an invoice for services rendered, filing a financing statement can perfect the security interest.

#### Concept: Consumer Goods as Collateral
Consumer goods are items purchased primarily for personal, family, or household use. These include home theatre systems, furniture, and other such items.

:p What is the automatic perfection method for PMSIs in consumer goods?
??x
A purchase-money security interest (PMSI) in consumer goods is automatically perfected at the time it is created, except for certain vehicles that must comply with certificate-of-title statutes. For other items, general rules of filing or possession apply.

Example: If a customer buys a home theatre system on credit, the creditor’s PMSI is automatically perfected upon creation.

#### Concept: Farm Products as Collateral
Farm products include crops (including aquatic goods), livestock, and supplies produced in a farming operation. This type of collateral often involves perishable items like ginned cotton, milk, eggs, maple syrup, etc.

:p How can farm products be used as security interest?
??x
Farming operations can use various methods to perfect their security interests in farm products. Typically, filing a financing statement is required. In some cases, possession or control might also be needed.

Example: A farmer might have a security interest in crops being harvested; filing a financing statement would notify potential buyers of this interest.
x??

---
#### Concept: Goods Held for Sale as Collateral
Goods held by an individual for sale or under a contract to sell can serve as collateral. This includes raw materials and work-in-progress.

:p How is perfection achieved for goods held for sale?
??x
Perfection for goods held for sale can be achieved through filing a financing statement, possession, or control over the goods. The specific method depends on the nature of the item and the agreement between the parties.

Example: If a manufacturer holds raw materials to produce finished goods, they might need to file a financing statement to perfect their security interest.
x??

---
#### Concept: Future Advances as Collateral
Future advances refer to additional funds that may be advanced in the future under an existing security agreement. These can include proceeds from the sale of collateral and after-acquired property.

:p How does a security interest cover future advances?
??x
A security interest can cover future advances, including proceeds from the sale of collateral and after-acquired property. This means that if additional funds are advanced in the future, the secured party has a claim on these funds as well.

Example: If People’s Bank has a security interest in inventory and later advances more money to fund an expansion project, this new advance is covered by the existing security agreement.

---
#### Floating Lien in a Shifting Stock of Goods
Background context: A floating lien can apply to goods that are in a constant state of change, such as raw materials turning into finished products and then being sold. This concept is crucial for understanding how liens follow the items they secure through various stages of production and sale.

:p What is a floating lien in the context of a shifting stock of goods?
??x
A floating lien refers to a security interest that can follow a collateral as it changes form or moves through different stages, such as from raw materials to finished products and then to accounts receivable. The bank's lien on Cascade's inventory would be an example of this.

#### Priorities in Security Interests
Background context: When multiple parties claim interests in the same collateral, determining which party has priority is essential. The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) provides detailed rules for these scenarios to ensure clarity and predictability.

:p What factors determine the priority when more than one party claims an interest in the same collateral?
??x
The priority of security interests is determined by several factors:
1. **Perfection**: A perfected security interest generally has priority over unperfected ones.
2. **Timing**: The first to perfect (by filing or taking possession) typically has priority.
3. **Attachment**: If none are perfected, the first one that attaches (is created) has priority.

In many cases, a perfected secured party's interest takes precedence over other claims and bankruptcy interests.

#### Perfected Security Interest Versus Unsecured Creditors
Background context: When multiple parties lay claim to the same collateral, the UCC provides rules for determining which party holds superior rights. A key scenario involves comparing perfected security interests with unsecured creditors.

:p In what situation does a perfected secured party have priority over other claims?
??x
A perfected secured party has priority over most other parties when two or more parties claim an interest in the same collateral [UCC 9–322(a)(2)]. This includes priority over proceeds from a sale of collateral resulting from bankruptcy, which gives the perfected secured party rights superior to those of the bankruptcy trustee.
x??

---
#### Conflicting Perfected Security Interests
Background context: If multiple parties have perfected security interests in the same collateral, the UCC specifies that generally, the first to perfect (by filing or taking possession) has priority.

:p How is priority determined when two secured parties have conflicting perfected security interests?
??x
When two secured parties have perfected security interests in the same collateral, the party who first perfected their interest by filing or taking possession of the collateral typically has priority [UCC 9–322(a)(1)].
x??

---
#### Conflicting Unperfected Security Interests
Background context: In cases where none of the conflicting security interests have been perfected, the UCC states that the first security interest to attach (be created) has priority.

:p How does the UCC handle situations with conflicting unperfected security interests?
??x
If two conflicting security interests are unperfected, the first one that attaches (is created) has priority [UCC 9–322(a)(3)]. This means the party whose interest was created first will have superior rights over later interests.
x??

#### First-In-Time Rule for Security Interests in Non-Inventory and Livestock
Background context: The first-in-time rule generally gives priority to a security interest that was perfected first. However, there are exceptions involving certain types of collateral, such as equipment (non-inventory and non-livestock). Heartland's security interest is extinguished when vehicles are sold to buyers in the ordinary course of business.
:p In what situation will Heartland lose its claim on the motor vehicles?
??x
Heartland loses its claim because Murdoch and Laxton, being buyers in the ordinary course of business, extinguish Heartland’s perfected PMSI (perfected security interest) when they purchase the vehicles. The first-in-time rule does not apply since Heartland's interest was already perfected but was subsequently extinguished by the sale.
x??

---

#### Priority with Non-Consumer Goods PMSI
Background context: A PMSI in non-consumer goods must be perfected, and if it is not automatically perfected (like motor vehicles), the holder must take additional steps to perfect their interest. In this example, West Bank's security interest in Sandoval’s equipment was perfected first but Zylex's PMSI could still have priority if properly perfected within 20 days after delivery.
:p Which party has priority with regard to the new piece of equipment purchased by Sandoval?
??x
West Bank would generally have priority because its interest was perfected first. However, if Zylex perfects its PMSI in the new equipment within twenty days after Sandoval takes possession on August 1, then Zylex would have priority.
x??

---

#### Priority with Inventory PMSI
Background context: A PMSI in inventory has priority over conflicting security interests, but this priority is maintained only if the holder of the PMSI notifies the holder of the conflicting interest before the debtor takes possession of the inventory. In this scenario, Key Bank's collateral clause might have priority because it was perfected first, unless Martin perfects its PMSI and gives proper notice.
:p Does Martin or Key Bank have priority with respect to the new inventory delivered to SNS on June 28?
??x
If Martin has not perfected its security interest by June 28, then Key Bank’s after-acquired collateral clause would have priority because it was first perfected (on May 1). However, if Martin perfects and gives proper notice of its security interest to Key Bank before SNS takes possession on June 28, Martin will have priority.
x??

---

#### Buyers of the Collateral
Background context: The UCC recognizes that certain buyers' interests in purchased goods could conflict with those of a perfected secured party. This concept is relevant when dealing with non-inventory and non-livestock collateral or inventory where the security interest holder did not perfect their interest.
:p What are the implications for buyers purchasing motor vehicles from Heartland?
??x
Buyers, such as Murdoch and Laxton, who purchase motor vehicles in the ordinary course of business extinguish Heartland's perfected PMSI. This means that Heartland will have no claim to these vehicles upon default, even though its interest was perfected first.

#### Information Requests
The secured party can request that the filing officer note specific information on a copy of the financing statement. This includes noting the file number, date, and hour of the original filing [UCC 9–523(a)].

:p What does the secured party request from the filing officer regarding the financing statement?
??x
The secured party requests that the filing officer note the file number, date, and hour of the original filing on a copy of the financing statement. This information can be provided upon request by the secured party or the debtor.
x??

---
#### Release, Assignment, and Amendment of Security Interest
A secured party has the right to release all or part of any collateral described in the financing statement, terminate its security interest in that collateral, and record this by filing a uniform amendment form [UCC 9–512, 9–521(b)]. A secured party can also assign the security interest to a third party (the assignee), with the assignee becoming the secured party of record if the assignment is filed using a uniform amendment form [UCC 9–514, 9–521(a)].

:p How can a secured party release or modify its security interest?
??x
A secured party can release all or part of any collateral by filing a uniform amendment form. This terminates the security interest in that collateral. The assignment of the security interest to a third party (assignee) is also possible, and this new assignee becomes the secured party of record upon filing using a uniform amendment form.
x??

#### Confirmation or Accounting Request by Debtor
A debtor has the right to request confirmation of the unpaid debt or list of collateral subject to the security interest. The debtor can make one such request without charge every six months [UCC 9–210]. The secured party must comply with this request by sending an authenticated accounting within fourteen days after receipt of the request, otherwise they could be liable for any losses suffered by the debtor plus $500 [UCC 9–210, 9–625(f)].

:p What rights does a debtor have regarding confirmation or accounting requests?
??x
A debtor has the right to request confirmation of the unpaid debt or list of collateral subject to the security interest. They can make one such request without charge every six months. The secured party must provide an authenticated accounting within fourteen days after receiving this request, otherwise they could be liable for any losses suffered by the debtor plus $500.
x??

---
#### Termination Statement
When a debtor has fully paid the debt and the secured party perfected the security interest by filing, the debtor is entitled to have a termination statement filed. This statement publicly demonstrates that the filed perfected security interest has been terminated [UCC 9–513]. For consumer goods, both a termination statement or release must be filed.

:p What does a debtor need to do when fully paying off a secured debt?
??x
When a debtor has fully paid the debt and the secured party has perfected the security interest by filing, the debtor is entitled to have a termination statement filed. This publicly demonstrates that the filed perfected security interest has been terminated. For consumer goods, both a termination statement or release must be filed.

#### Self-Help Provision of Article 9
Background context: The UCC refers to a "self-help" provision under Article 9, which allows secured parties to take possession of collateral without judicial intervention. This provision does not define what constitutes peaceful possession, but generally requires that repossession be done without breaching the peace.

:p What is the self-help provision in Article 9?
??x
The self-help provision in Article 9 permits a secured party to repossess collateral by themselves without going through judicial procedures, provided they do so without breaching the peace. This means actions like trespassing or breaking and entering are not allowed.
x??

---
#### Judicial Remedies
Background context: If a secured party chooses not to use self-help, it can relinquish the security interest and pursue a judicial remedy such as obtaining a judgment on the underlying debt, followed by execution and levy.

:p What does "judicial remedies" refer to in this context?
??x
Judicial remedies involve a secured party seeking legal action through courts. This includes obtaining a judgment for the underlying debt and then executing that judgment by seizing and selling non-exempt property of the debtor.
x??

---
#### Disposition of Collateral
Background context: Once default has occurred, and the secured party has taken possession of the collateral, there are various ways to handle it, including retaining or disposing of the collateral in a commercially reasonable manner.

:p How can a secured party dispose of the collateral after default?
??x
A secured party can sell, lease, license, or otherwise dispose of the collateral in any commercially reasonable manner and apply the proceeds toward satisfaction of the debt. However, any sale must comply with state laws.
x??

---
#### Retention of Collateral by Secured Party
Background context: The UCC generally allows secured parties to retain the collateral if it is not consumer goods or if the debtor has paid more than 60 percent of the purchase price.

:p Under what conditions can a secured party retain the collateral?
??x
A secured party can retain the collateral unless it consists of consumer goods and the debtor has paid 60 percent or more of the purchase price in a PMSI (Pledged-Made-to-Specification) or debt in a non-PMSI. This retention is subject to several limitations, including notice requirements.
x??

---
#### Notice Requirements
Background context: The secured party must notify the debtor and potentially other parties about its intention to retain the collateral unless specific conditions are met.

:p What are the notice requirements for retaining collateral?
??x
The secured party must notify the debtor of its proposal to retain the collateral. If the collateral is consumer goods, no additional notices are required. Otherwise, the secured party must also send a notice to any other secured party with an interest in the collateral and to any junior lienholder who held a security interest or statutory lien in the collateral 10 days before debtor consented to retention.
x??

---
#### Objections to Retention
Background context: The debtor or notified parties have the right to object to the secured party’s intent to retain the collateral. If an objection is received, the collateral must be sold or otherwise disposed of.

:p What can happen if a written objection is received regarding the retention?
??x
If a written objection is received within 20 days after notice is sent, the secured party must sell or otherwise dispose of the collateral. If no objection is received, the secured party may retain the collateral in full or partial satisfaction of the debtor’s obligation.
x??

---
#### Consumer Goods and Retention Rights
Background context: For consumer goods, specific conditions apply regarding retention rights if the debtor has paid 60 percent or more of the purchase price.

:p What special rules apply to consumer goods under Article 9?
??x
When the collateral is consumer goods and the debtor has paid 60 percent of the purchase price on a PMSI or loan amount, the secured party must retain the collateral unless it sells it. This retention right is subject to notice requirements and potential objections.
