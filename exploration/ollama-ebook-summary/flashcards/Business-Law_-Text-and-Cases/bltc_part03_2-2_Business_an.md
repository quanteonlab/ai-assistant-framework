#### Dormant Commerce Clause
Background context explaining that the dormant commerce clause is an implied restriction on state laws that unduly burden interstate commerce. The clause is used to evaluate whether a state law or regulation imposes restrictions that could potentially harm out-of-state economic interests.

:p What does the dormant commerce clause imply?
??x
The dormant commerce clause implies that states cannot pass legislation that discriminates against or excessively burdens interstate commerce, even though this restriction is not explicitly stated in the Constitution. This principle ensures that states do not favor their own residents or businesses over those from other states.

#### Case in Point 2.3: Maryland’s Personal Income Tax Scheme
Background context explaining the specific case where Maryland's personal income tax scheme was challenged for discriminating against intrastate commerce and violating the dormant commerce clause.

:p How did the U.S. Supreme Court rule on Maryland's personal income tax scheme?
??x
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Maryland’s system of taxing residents who earned profits in other states more heavily than those whose only income came from within Maryland violated the dormant commerce clause. The court found that this discriminatory treatment of out-of-state income compared to intrastate income was improper and invalidated the state's tax scheme.

#### Supremacy Clause and Federal Preemption
Background context explaining the Supremacy Clause, which establishes that federal laws are supreme over state laws when there is a direct conflict. It also explains how preemption occurs when Congress chooses to act exclusively in a concurrent area.

:p What does the Supremacy Clause state?
??x
The Supremacy Clause states that the Constitution, laws, and treaties of the United States are "the supreme Law of the Land." This means that if there is a direct conflict between a federal law and a state law, the state law is rendered invalid.

Example: 
```java
if (isFederalLaw()) {
    applyFederalLaw();
} else {
    // State laws are not applicable due to Supremacy Clause
}
```
x??

---
#### Preemption by Congressional Intent
Background context explaining that when Congress does not explicitly preempt a subject area, the courts will determine whether Congress intended to exercise exclusive power. This involves analyzing the nature of federal law and its enforcement.

:p How do courts determine congressional intent for preemption?
??x
Courts determine congressional intent for preemption through several factors:
1. The text and structure of the statute.
2. The overall objectives and purposes of the federal law.
3. The scheme created by Congress, including whether it is so pervasive or detailed that states have little room to act.
4. Congressional statements indicating exclusive control over a specific subject.

Example: 
```java
if (isFederalLawPervasive()) {
    enforceFederalLaw();
} else if (federalAgencyEnforces()) {
    applyAgenciesJurisdiction();
}
```
x??

---
#### Pervasive and Comprehensive Federal Law
Background context explaining that when federal laws are pervasive, comprehensive, or detailed, states have little room to regulate in the same area. This often leads to preemption of state laws.

:p What characteristics make a federal law likely to preempt a state law?
??x
A federal law is likely to preempt a state law if it:
- Is so pervasive that it covers the entire subject matter.
- Is comprehensive, meaning there are no gaps in its coverage.
- Is detailed with specific regulations that leave little room for states to act.

Example: 
```java
if (federalLawIsPervasive()) {
    // Federal Law Preempts State Law
} else if (stateLawConflictsWithFederal()) {
    invalidateStateLaw();
}
```

#### Incorporation Doctrine
The Supreme Court's practice of applying most provisions of the Bill of Rights to state actions through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This process began in 1925 and significantly expanded civil liberties protections against both federal and state governments.

:p How did the U.S. Supreme Court apply the Bill of Rights to state actions?
??x
The Supreme Court used the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to gradually incorporate most rights from the Bill of Rights, making them applicable to state actions as well. This began in 1925 with Gitlow v. New York and was expanded over time.
x??

---

#### The Fourteenth Amendment
Passed after the Civil War in 1868, it provides that no state shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.

:p What is the primary purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment?
??x
The primary purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was to protect individual rights from infringement by state governments following the Civil War. It aimed to ensure that states would not violate fundamental liberties such as life, liberty, and property.
x??

---

#### Rights Secured by the Bill of Rights
Many of these rights are stated in very general terms, allowing for judicial interpretation.

:p How do the rights set forth in the Bill of Rights differ from more specific laws?
??x
The rights secured by the Bill of Rights are often defined in broad terms, which allows judges to interpret and apply them flexibly based on contemporary circumstances. For example, the right to bear arms under the Second Amendment is not explicitly detailed, leading to ongoing judicial debates about its scope.
x??

---

#### Second Amendment: Right to Bear Arms
The amendment states that the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed, but does not specify the extent or manner of this right.

:p What limitations are placed on the Second Amendment's protection?
??x
The Supreme Court has noted that the Second Amendment does not grant an unrestricted right to carry any weapon in any manner for any purpose. For instance, legislatures can prohibit carrying concealed weapons or certain types of dangerous weapons like machine guns.
x??

---

#### First Amendment: Freedom of Religion, Speech, Press, Assembly, and Petition
Guarantees freedoms related to religion, speech, press, peaceful assembly, and the right to petition government.

:p What specific freedoms does the First Amendment protect?
??x
The First Amendment protects five specific freedoms:
- Freedom of religion (including both establishment and free exercise)
- Freedom of speech
- Freedom of the press
- Right to assemble peaceably
- Right to petition the government for redress of grievances
x??

---

#### Tenth Amendment: Reserved Powers
Establishes that powers not delegated to the federal government or denied to states are reserved to the states and people.

:p What does the Tenth Amendment establish?
??x
The Tenth Amendment reserves powers not explicitly granted to the federal government, nor forbidden to the states, for the states or the people. This means that unless a power is specifically given to the federal government in the Constitution, it remains with the states or individuals.
x??

---

#### Judicial Interpretation of Rights
While rights are not absolute, many of them have been interpreted by courts as constituting "due process of law."

:p How do courts interpret and apply the Bill of Rights?
??x
Courts interpret and apply the Bill of Rights by defining the scope and limits of various freedoms. For example, while the Second Amendment guarantees a right to bear arms, it is subject to certain limitations such as restrictions on carrying concealed weapons or dangerous weapons.
x??

---

#### Specific Amendments
- Fifth: Guarantees indictment by a grand jury, due process, and protection from self-incrimination and double jeopardy.
- Sixth: Ensures the right to a speedy and public trial, with counsel, and to confront witnesses.
- Seventh: Guarantees the right to a jury trial in civil cases involving more than $20.
- Eighth: Prohibits excessive bail or fines and cruel and unusual punishment.

:p What specific protections does each of these amendments provide?
??x
The specific protections provided by each amendment are as follows:
- **Fifth Amendment**: Guarantees indictment by a grand jury, due process, protection from self-incrimination, and prohibition on double jeopardy.
- **Sixth Amendment**: Ensures the right to a speedy and public trial, with counsel, and the right to confront witnesses against you.
- **Seventh Amendment**: Guarantees the right to a jury trial in civil cases where damages exceed $20.
- **Eighth Amendment**: Prohibits excessive bail or fines, as well as cruel and unusual punishment.

#### Compelling Government Interest Test for Free Expression
Background context: The compelling government interest test is a legal standard used to evaluate whether a statute or regulation is valid. This test balances the government’s interest against an individual's constitutional right to free expression. For the statute to be upheld, it must serve a compelling governmental interest that can only be furthered by the specific law in question.

The Supreme Court has recognized that schools may restrict students’ speech at school events under certain conditions.
:p What is the purpose of the compelling government interest test?
??x
The purpose of the compelling government interest test is to ensure that any limitation on free expression by the government serves a very important and necessary interest. This means that for a statute or regulation to be valid, it must significantly advance a critical governmental objective.

In the context of schools, this test allows them to restrict student speech if such restrictions are essential to maintaining school order and safety.
x??

---

#### Case in Point: Morse v. Frederick
Background context: In Morse v. Frederick (2007), the Supreme Court ruled that schools can restrict students' speech at off-campus events where there is a direct connection between the speech and the school environment.

The case involved high school students holding up a banner saying "Bong Hits 4 Jesus" at an off-campus, school-sanctioned event. The Supreme Court held that confiscating the banner and suspending the students for ten days was justified because the banner could be reasonably interpreted as promoting drugs.
:p What did the Supreme Court decide in Morse v. Frederick regarding student speech?
??x
The Supreme Court ruled that schools can restrict student speech at off-campus events if such speech is likely to disrupt the school environment or promote illegal activity, even when the event itself is not directly on school premises.

In this specific case, the banner "Bong Hits 4 Jesus" was deemed a threat because it could be reasonably interpreted as promoting drug use, thus justifying the school's actions.
x??

---

#### Narrow Tailoring Requirement in Morse v. Frederick
Background context: The narrow tailoring requirement is a standard used to evaluate whether a law or regulation targets only the speech that needs to be restricted and leaves open ample alternative channels for communication.

In Morse v. Frederick, the Court upheld the school's actions based on the argument that the ban on drug-related speech was narrowly tailored and directly related to maintaining order.
:p How did the Supreme Court justify the school’s restriction in Morse v. Frederick?
??x
The Supreme Court justified the school’s restriction by arguing that the prohibition of drug-related speech at off-campus, school-sanctioned events was necessary to maintain a safe and orderly environment. The Court concluded that the ban directly addressed the specific issue of promoting illegal activities, making it narrowly tailored.

The justices noted, however, that this decision could create an exception allowing schools to censor any student speech mentioning drugs.
x??

---

#### Animal Legal Defense Fund v. Wasden
Background context: In Animal Legal Defense Fund v. Wasden (2018), the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on a case involving a state statute that criminalized making audio and video recordings of agricultural production facilities without the owner's consent.

The court found that the Recordings Clause was a content-based restriction on speech, which could not survive strict scrutiny under the First Amendment. The statute aimed to prevent undercover investigations but was challenged for violating free expression rights.
:p What did the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decide in Animal Legal Defense Fund v. Wasden?
??x
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Recordings Clause criminalizing audio and video recordings of agricultural production facilities without consent is a content-based restriction on speech, which cannot survive strict scrutiny under the First Amendment.

The court held that the statute was too broad and not narrowly tailored to achieve its goals, thus violating free expression rights.
x??

---

#### Internet Speech Regulation
Background context explaining the concept. The Supreme Court held that a statute prohibiting online obscenity was valid because it did not prohibit a substantial amount of protected speech, but acknowledged the challenges of policing the internet and the complexities involved in prohibiting obscenity through legislation.
:p What is the legal status of statutes prohibiting online obscenity according to the Supreme Court's decision?
??x
The Supreme Court held that a statute prohibiting online obscenity was valid because it did not prohibit a substantial amount of protected speech, but noted the difficulties of policing the internet and the constitutional complexities involved in such legislation. This means that while such laws may be upheld based on their limited impact on free speech, they remain contentious due to practical enforcement challenges.
x??

---
#### Establishment Clause
Background context explaining the concept. The establishment clause prohibits the government from establishing a state-sponsored religion or passing laws that promote (aid or endorse) religion or show a preference for one religion over another. It involves the separation of church and state but does not require complete separation, as some government actions may have minimal impacts on religious practices.
:p What is the primary purpose of the establishment clause?
??x
The primary purpose of the establishment clause is to prevent the government from establishing an official religion or passing laws that promote or show a preference for one religion over another. It aims to maintain a separation between church and state, but does not require absolute separation as long as government actions do not significantly burden religious practices.
x??

---
#### Religious Displays on Public Property
Background context explaining the concept. The Supreme Court has ruled that public displays of religious symbols must be evaluated based on their primary effect, with considerations given to historical significance and proximity to non-religious symbols. A cross at a war memorial can violate the establishment clause if it strongly endorses Christianity over other religions.
:p How does the Supreme Court evaluate the constitutionality of religious displays on public property?
??x
The Supreme Court evaluates the constitutionality of religious displays on public property by considering their primary effect, historical significance, and proximity to non-religious symbols. A display is constitutional if its primary purpose is not to promote or endorse religion over other religions. For example, a cross at a war memorial can violate the establishment clause if it strongly endorses Christianity over other religions.
x??

---
#### Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA)
Background context explaining the concept. The CIPA requires schools and libraries that receive federal funds for internet access to implement filters to block obscene, child pornography, or harmful material online. It was upheld by the Supreme Court because it did not significantly burden free speech rights.
:p What is the Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA)?
??x
The Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA) requires schools and libraries that receive federal funds for internet access to implement filters to block obscene, child pornography, or harmful material online. It was upheld by the Supreme Court because it did not significantly burden free speech rights.
x??

---
#### Religious Symbols at Mount Soledad
Background context explaining the concept. The Supreme Court ruled on a case involving a cross atop Mount Soledad, finding that its primary effect of endorsing Christianity over other religions violated the establishment clause despite its historical significance and proximity to non-religious symbols.
:p What was the outcome of the Mount Soledad case?
??x
The Supreme Court found that the cross at Mount Soledad violated the establishment clause because its primary effect endorsed Christianity over other religions, even though it had historical significance. The court noted that the cross physically dominated the site and sent a strong message of endorsement.
x??

---

#### Due Process
Background context: The due process clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments ensures that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without proper procedures being followed. This clause applies to both individuals and legal persons (corporations). There are two main aspects of due process: procedural and substantive.

- **Procedural Due Process**: Requires fair procedures when the government makes decisions affecting a person's rights. The key elements include notice, an opportunity to be heard, and an impartial decision maker.
  
- **Substantive Due Process**: Focuses on the content of legislation rather than the fairness of the process itself. It limits what the government can do through its legislative and executive actions, ensuring that any law or action must be fair, reasonable, and further a legitimate governmental objective.

Example: In Doyle Burns' case, she was expelled from her nursing program for taking a photo without giving her an opportunity to present her side to school authorities. The expulsion violated her due process rights because it did not provide the required procedural fairness.
:p What does the due process clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments guarantee?
??x
The due process clause guarantees that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without proper procedures being followed by the government. This applies to both individuals and legal persons (corporations).
x??

---
#### Procedural Due Process
Background context: Procedural due process ensures that when the government makes decisions affecting a person's rights, it must follow fair procedures. These include giving notice, an opportunity to be heard, and ensuring impartiality.

Example: In the case of Doyle Burns, she was expelled from her nursing program for taking a photo without giving her an opportunity to present her side to school authorities. This violated her procedural due process rights because she did not receive proper notice and an opportunity to defend herself.
:p What does procedural due process require?
??x
Procedural due process requires that any government decision affecting a person's life, liberty, or property must be made equitably through fair procedures. This includes providing proper notice, an opportunity to be heard, and ensuring the decision is made by an impartial, neutral party.
x??

---
#### Substantive Due Process
Background context: Substantive due process focuses on the content of legislation rather than the fairness of the process itself. It limits what the government can do through its legislative and executive actions, ensuring that any law or action must be fair, reasonable, and further a legitimate governmental objective.

Example: A state must have a substantial reason for infringing on an individual's free speech rights under substantive due process. If it does not have such a reason, it would violate the substantive due process.
:p What is substantive due process concerned with?
??x
Substantive due process is concerned with the content of legislation and limits what the government can do through its legislative and executive actions. It ensures that any law or action must be fair, reasonable, and further a legitimate governmental objective.
x??

---
#### Equal Protection
Background context: The Fourteenth Amendment states that no state shall "deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." This clause has been interpreted by the Supreme Court to also apply to the federal government through the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.

Example: If a state law treats similarly situated individuals differently, it may violate the equal protection clause. For instance, a law that discriminates against one group while treating another identically could be challenged under this clause.
:p What does the equal protection clause protect against?
??x
The equal protection clause protects against laws or actions by the government that treat similarly situated individuals differently. It ensures that all persons are subject to the same laws and cannot be denied the equal protection of the laws.
x??

---
#### Summary of Due Process and Equal Protection
Background context: Both due process and equal protection are constitutional guarantees that protect American citizens from unfair treatment by the government. Due process ensures fair procedures, while equal protection ensures that similarly situated individuals are treated equally under the law.

Example: If a state passes a law that infringes on fundamental rights (such as free speech) without a legitimate reason, it would violate substantive due process. Similarly, if a state discriminates against one group by treating them differently than another, it could be challenged under the equal protection clause.
:p How do due process and equal protection differ?
??x
Due process ensures fair procedures when the government makes decisions affecting an individual's rights. Equal protection ensures that similarly situated individuals are treated equally under the law. Due process is concerned with the fairness of the process itself, while equal protection focuses on the content of legislation.
x??

---

#### State Law and Rational Basis Test
In matters of economic or social welfare, a law is considered valid under the "Rational Basis" test if it has any conceivable rational basis related to a legitimate government interest. Courts are lenient with this standard, making it almost impossible for a law to fail.
:p What is the key principle behind the Rational Basis Test in legal matters?
??x
The Rational Basis Test ensures that laws affecting economic or social welfare are upheld as long as they have any reasonable basis and serve a legitimate government interest. The test is designed to be very lenient, making it difficult for such laws to be struck down.
x??

---

#### Kentucky Statute on Selling Wine and Liquor
A Kentucky statute prohibits businesses selling staple groceries or gasoline from also applying for a license to sell wine and liquor. This case demonstrates how courts apply the Rational Basis Test by considering if the statute is rationally related to a legitimate government interest, such as reducing access to alcohol.
:p How did the court rule on the Kentucky statute in Maxwell’s Pic-Pac?
??x
The court ruled that the statute was rationally related to a legitimate government interest in reducing public exposure to high-alcohol-content products. The state's interest extended beyond the businesses involved and encompassed the general public, making it constitutional.
x??

---

#### Privacy Rights Under the U.S. Constitution
Privacy rights are not explicitly mentioned in the U.S. Constitution but were recognized by the Supreme Court through landmark cases like Griswold v. Connecticut, which implied a right to privacy based on other amendments such as the First, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Ninth Amendments.
:p What was the significance of the Griswold v. Connecticut case?
??x
The Griswold v. Connecticut case was significant because it endorsed the view that the Constitution protects individual privacy rights by implying a constitutional right to privacy through other amendments. This decision recognized that privacy is "the most comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by civilized men."
x??

---

#### Federal Privacy Legislation
Congress has enacted several statutes in recent decades to protect individuals' privacy, particularly concerning personal information collected by governments or businesses. Notable laws include the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).
:p What is the purpose of the Freedom of Information Act?
??x
The Freedom of Information Act allows individuals to request copies of their personal information contained in federal government files, thus providing a mechanism for public access and transparency. It aims to ensure that citizens can review and correct inaccuracies in their records.
x??

---

#### Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
Passed in the 1990s, HIPAA defines and limits the circumstances under which an individual's "protected health information" may be used or disclosed by healthcare providers, plans, and others. This act was crucial for protecting individuals' medical records.
:p What does HIPAA protect?
??x
HIPAA protects individuals' "protected health information," defining its usage and disclosure limitations to ensure that sensitive medical data is handled securely. It restricts how this information can be used or disclosed by healthcare providers, plans, and other entities.
x??

---

---
#### Bill of Rights
The Bill of Rights consists of the first ten amendments to the United States Constitution, which are designed to protect individual rights and liberties. These include freedom of speech, religion, press, assembly, and petition; protection against unreasonable searches and seizures; due process; equal protection; and many others.
:p What argument could power utilities use as a defense when South Dakota passes a law banning all advertising by them?
??x
Power utilities could argue that the state's ban on their advertising violates their First Amendment right to free speech. The First Amendment, which is part of the Bill of Rights, protects citizens' rights to speak freely and engage in free commerce through advertisements. By prohibiting such communications, South Dakota is effectively infringing on a fundamental constitutional right.
x??

---
#### Commerce Clause
The Commerce Clause grants Congress the authority to regulate interstate commerce. However, states can also regulate activities within their borders that affect commerce.
:p Does a Georgia state law requiring contoured rear-fender mudguards violate any constitutional provisions?
??x
The Georgia statute might be challenged under the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, as well as the Commerce Clause. The statute appears to favor in-state businesses over out-of-state competitors, which could potentially violate equal protection if it is not narrowly tailored or rationally related to a legitimate state interest. Additionally, the law might be seen as an undue burden on interstate commerce.
x??

---
#### Equal Protection
The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits states from denying any person within its jurisdiction "the equal protection of the laws." This means that laws must not classify individuals unequally without a rational basis or a compelling government interest, and classifications based on race, national origin, etc., are subject to strict scrutiny.
:p How should the court rule in the New York City ordinance case involving female topless entertainment?
??x
The court would apply strict scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause. This means that the law must be narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling government interest. Since the ordinance only applies to female topless dancers, it may not pass this rigorous test as it appears to classify individuals based on gender without a compelling state interest.

Given that the primary goals of maintaining property values and quality of urban life can generally apply to all entertainment establishments regardless of gender, the ordinance likely fails the strict scrutiny test. The court would probably rule in favor of Adele Buzzetti and the dancer, blocking the enforcement of the ordinance.
x??

---
#### Due Process Clause
The Due Process Clause ensures that no person shall be deprived of "life, liberty, or property" without due process of law. This clause includes both procedural due process (requiring fair procedures) and substantive due process (protecting fundamental rights).
:p Is it a violation of due process if South Dakota imposes a higher tax on out-of-state companies compared to in-state companies?
??x
It would depend on the specific circumstances, but generally, imposing different taxes based solely on where a company is located could be seen as violating due process. The Equal Protection Clause and Due Process Clause both require that laws treat individuals equally without arbitrary discrimination.

In this case, if the only reason for the higher tax is to protect local firms from out-of-state competition, it might be challenged under the Equal Protection Clause. However, due process would also come into play as the tax must not deprive companies of their property (taxes) without fair procedures.
x??

---
#### Free Exercise Clause
The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment protects an individual's right to freely exercise his or her religion. This clause applies to both federal and state governments, preventing them from imposing undue burdens on religious practice.
:p Does Mark Wooden's e-mail violate any rights under the Bill of Rights?
??x
Mark Wooden’s e-mail could be seen as a form of symbolic speech protected by the First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of expression. Comparing an alderwoman to Jezebel, a biblical character known for her wickedness, is a matter of opinion and political commentary.

However, if the content was sufficiently offensive or threatening, it might not enjoy full protection under the Free Exercise Clause. The courts would need to weigh whether his speech crossed the line into actionable harassment or defamation.
x??

---
#### Supremacy Clause
The Supremacy Clause in Article VI of the Constitution states that federal laws are supreme and must be obeyed over conflicting state laws. This means that if there is a conflict between a federal law and a state law, the federal law prevails.
:p Does Georgia's mudguards statute violate the Supremacy Clause?
??x
Georgia’s mudguard statute would not necessarily violate the Supremacy Clause unless it directly conflicts with an existing federal law or regulation. However, if there is no such conflict, states are generally allowed to regulate matters of public safety and commerce within their borders.

For instance, Georgia could have its own rationale for mandating contoured mudguards that aligns with local needs and conditions, even if other states permit straight mudguards.
x??

---
#### Police Powers
State and local governments have the inherent power known as "police powers" to regulate activities and enact laws for the health, safety, welfare, and morals of their citizens. These powers are often exercised through regulations that affect businesses and individuals.
:p Can New York City's adult entertainment establishment ordinance be justified under police powers?
??x
New York City’s adult entertainment establishment ordinance could potentially be justified under its police powers if it is reasonably related to the city’s legitimate objectives—such as crime prevention, maintaining property values, or preserving urban quality of life.

To pass constitutional muster, the ordinance would need to show that female topless dancers are particularly associated with negative outcomes and that targeting them alone is necessary to achieve these goals. If other measures could effectively address these issues without singling out women, the ordinance might be deemed unconstitutional.
x??

#### Regency Transportation, Inc. v. Commissioner of Revenue, 473 Mass. 459, 42 N.E.3d 1133 (2016)
Regency Transportation operates a freight business throughout the eastern United States and maintains its corporate headquarters in Massachusetts. The state imposes a use tax on all taxpayers subject to its jurisdiction, including those that do business in interstate commerce. Regency challenged the assessment as discriminatory under the Commerce Clause.
:p What is the chief consideration under the Commerce Clause when a state law affects interstate commerce?
??x
The chief consideration is whether the state law impermissibly burdens or discriminates against interstate commerce. In this case, Massachusetts’s use tax on the purchase price of each tractor and trailer in Regency's fleet may be scrutinized for its impact on interstate commerce.
??x

---

#### Wandering Dago, Inc. v. Destito, 879 F.3d 20 (2d Cir. 2018)
Wandering Dago operates a food truck in Albany, New York, with branding that includes language generally viewed as ethnic slurs. The New York State Office of General Services denied the company's application to participate in a summer lunch program because of the offensive branding.
:p What principles apply to the government’s regulation of the content of speech?
??x
The principles governing the government’s regulation of the content of speech are based on the level of scrutiny applied by courts. For content-based restrictions, the government must show that the restriction serves a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.
??x

---

#### People v. Starski, 7 Cal.App.5th 215, 212 Cal.Rptr.3d 622 (1 Dist. Div. 2 2017)
Starski sent a “notice of a legal claim” to Michael Mayfield, president of Mendo Mill and Lumber Co., claiming that a customer’s injury was due to an employee’s incompetence. The notice presented a settlement offer in exchange for a release of liability. Starski falsely claimed to be an attorney.
:p Is creating the illusion that he is an attorney protected by the First Amendment?
??x
Starski's actions are not protected by the First Amendment because they constitute the unauthorized practice of law, which is a criminal offense under California’s statute. The government can regulate speech when it directly involves illegal activity, such as practicing law without a license.
??x

---

#### Conflict Between Free Speech and Government Regulation of Law Practice
The case involving Starski highlights the tension between free speech protections and the government's regulation of professional practice.
:p Identify and discuss how to resolve the conflict between the right to free speech and the government’s regulation of the practice of law?
??x
To resolve this conflict, courts often apply strict scrutiny. The government must demonstrate a compelling interest in regulating professional conduct (like the practice of law) and that the regulation is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. In Starski's case, his false claim to be an attorney directly involves illegal activity, which justifies the restriction on free speech.
