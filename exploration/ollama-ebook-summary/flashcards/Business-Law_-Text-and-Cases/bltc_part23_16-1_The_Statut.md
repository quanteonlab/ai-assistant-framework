#### Time Period for Contract Enforcement
Background context: The text explains that a contract starts to be enforceable one year after it is formed. If performance cannot be completed within this period, the contract must be in writing. Conversely, if performance can be completed within a year, the contract does not need to be in writing.
:p What time period begins when a contract is formed according to the text?
??x
The one-year period starts running from the day after the contract is made. If the performance cannot be completed within this one-year period, the contract must be in writing to be enforceable.
x??

---
#### Writing Requirement for Oral Contracts
Background context: The text states that if a contract involves performance that cannot be completed within one year, it must be in writing. This rule applies even if the agreement is unlikely to be performed during this period. Performance being objectively impossible within one year triggers the need for a written contract.
:p Under what condition does an oral contract require a written form according to the text?
??x
An oral contract requires a written form when performance is objectively impossible to complete within one year, regardless of whether the agreement is likely to be performed during that period.
x??

---
#### Example of Objective Impossibility
Background context: The example provided explains that a contract for five crops of tomatoes in Illinois cannot be performed within one year as it would violate agricultural norms. This illustrates when performance is objectively impossible.
:p Provide an example from the text where performance is objectively impossible to perform within one year.
??x
An example given is a contract to provide five crops of tomatoes on a specific farm in Illinois, which is objectively impossible because no farmer can grow five crops of tomatoes in a single year.
x??

#### Statute of Frauds and Real-Estate Contracts
Background context: The text discusses the Statute of Frauds for real-estate contracts. It states that such contracts must be in writing to be enforceable, including details like property description and terms of sale. The example involves a dispute over a down payment where uncertainties were resolved by a warranty deed.
:p What is required under the Statute of Frauds for real-estate contracts according to the text?
??x
The Statute of Frauds requires that a contract for the sale of land must be in writing and include essential information such as the terms and conditions, price, time of payment, and a description of the property.
x??

---
#### Uncertainty Resolution with Warranty Deed
Background context: In the case described, there were uncertainties in the real-estate contract regarding sellers' names and property descriptions. However, these uncertainties were resolved by the warranty deed, which provided the necessary details.
:p How were ambiguities in a real-estate contract resolved according to the text?
??x
Ambiguities in the real-estate contract were resolved by the warranty deed, which clearly named the Kikers as sellers and provided a formal legal description of the property.
x??

---
#### Contracts and E-Contracts
Background context: The passage discusses scenarios where written contracts are not required due to specific purposes. It mentions that contracts can be formed orally if the main purpose is to secure a benefit for oneself, such as payment of debt or ensuring business continuity.

:p What is an example situation where a contract need not be in writing?
??x
An example situation is when Braswell promises Newform Supply to guarantee payment if Newform continues to deliver materials. This promise can be made orally since the main purpose is securing a benefit for herself.
x??

---
#### Promises Made in Consideration of Marriage
Background context: The passage explains that unilateral promises involving marriage, such as monetary payments or property gifts, must be in writing according to the Statute of Frauds.

:p What kind of promise needs to be in writing?
??x
A unilateral promise made in consideration of a promise to marry needs to be in writing. For example, Evan’s promise to buy Celeste a condo if she marries him would require written evidence.
x??

---
#### Pre-Nuptial Agreements
Background context: The text highlights that pre-nuptial agreements defining ownership rights must also be in writing.

:p What is an example of a pre-nuptial agreement?
??x
Nicole Kidman’s pre-nuptial agreement with Keith Urban, where she agreed to pay $640,000 for every year they were married unless he started using drugs again, is an example. This agreement must be in writing.
x??

---
#### Contracts for the Sale of Goods
Background context: The passage explains that contracts for the sale of goods priced at $500 or more require written evidence or electronic records under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) Statute of Frauds.

:p What does the UCC Statute of Frauds require?
??x
The UCC Statute of Frauds requires a writing or electronic record for contracts involving the sale of goods priced at $500 or more. The writing needs to state the quantity, but not necessarily other terms like payment details.
x??

---
#### Exceptions to the Writing Requirement
Background context: The text mentions that there are exceptions to the Statute of Frauds where a written agreement is not required.

:p What is an example of a collateral promise?
??x
A collateral promise, such as C (a third party) agreeing to pay A’s debt if A does not, must be in writing. This type of promise falls under the Statute of Frauds and requires a signed writing.

#### Parol Evidence Rule
Background context: The parol evidence rule is a common law principle that restricts parties from presenting oral or written statements made prior to or contemporaneously with a written contract to contradict, modify, or add to its terms. This rule aims to ensure that the final agreement is as stated in the signed document.

If applicable, add code examples with explanations:
```java
// Pseudocode for understanding the application of Parol Evidence Rule
public class Contract {
    public String leaseContract;
    public boolean petPolicy;

    public void checkPetPolicy(String contract) {
        // Check if the written contract explicitly states no pets are allowed
        this.leaseContract = contract;
        if (!contract.contains("pets allowed")) {
            this.petPolicy = false; // No pets allowed as per written contract
        } else {
            this.petPolicy = true; // Pets are allowed as per written contract
        }
    }

    public boolean verifyPetAllowed(String tenantStatement) {
        // Tenant claims that cats are allowed in the lease (parol evidence)
        return petPolicy && tenantStatement.contains("cats are allowed");
    }
}
```

:p What is the parol evidence rule, and when does it apply?
??x
The parol evidence rule prohibits parties from presenting oral or written statements made prior to or contemporaneously with a written contract to contradict, modify, or add to its terms. It applies when a court finds that a written contract represents the complete and final statement of the parties' agreement.

Example:
A landlord tells a tenant that cats are allowed in the apartment (oral understanding), but the lease clearly states no pets are permitted. If this situation goes to court, the oral understanding cannot be used to contradict the written terms.

#### Exceptions to the Parol Evidence Rule
Background context: The rigidity of the parol evidence rule can sometimes lead to unfair outcomes, so courts have created several exceptions. These include modifications after contract formation, voidable or void contracts, and ambiguous terms.

:p What are some common exceptions to the parol evidence rule?
??x
1. **Subsequent Modifications:** Evidence of any subsequent oral or written modification of a written contract can be introduced in court.
2. **Voidable or Void Contracts:** Oral evidence can be used to show that the contract was voidable or void due to factors like mistake, fraud, or misrepresentation.
3. **Ambiguous Terms:** When terms are ambiguous and require interpretation, evidence is admissible to clarify their meaning.

Example:
A written lease states no pets allowed but a modification increases the price of goods sold over $500 (oral modification not enforceable). However, if the contract provides that any change must be in writing, oral changes may still not be enforceable.

#### Case in Point 16.13 - Howard and Eleanor Windows
Background context: In this case, Howard and Eleanor Windows sued their insurance company, Erie Insurance Exchange, for breach of contract after raw sewage caused water damage to their home. The insurance policy excluded coverage for water or sewage backing up through sewers.

:p What is the legal issue in the Case in Point 16.13?
??x
The legal issue is whether the insurance policy covers the claim made by Howard and Eleanor Windows due to raw sewage backing up into their home, despite the exclusion clause stating that it does not cover water or sewage which backs up through sewers.

Example:
Erie Insurance Exchange argues that since the damage was caused by water or sewage backing up, it falls under the general exclusion in the policy. However, Howard and Eleanor Windows might argue that the wording of "backs up" is ambiguous and seek to introduce evidence that clarifies its meaning.

#### UCC 2–209(2), (3)
Background context: The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) section 2-209 deals with modifications of contracts for sale. Specifically, it states that a modification made by the parties after the contract is formed may not be enforceable if it is oral and does not satisfy certain conditions, such as being in writing.

:p What does UCC 2–209(2), (3) state regarding modifications to contracts?
??x
UCC 2-209(2), (3) states that a modification of a contract for the sale of goods made by the parties after its formation is not enforceable over the objection of any party unless it is in writing and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought.

Example:
If Moore's compensation agreement does not sufficiently describe the leases subject to the agreement, it might be void and unenforceable under UCC 2-209(3) if the agreement lacks a written description of the leases.
