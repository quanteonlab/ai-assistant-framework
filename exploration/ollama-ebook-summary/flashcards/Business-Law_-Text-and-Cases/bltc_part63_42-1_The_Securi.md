x??

---

Background on Judge Waterman’s opinion that knowledge of a potentially large mineral discovery could be material even if it wasn't fully proven.
:p What did Judge Waterman say about the materiality of TGS's findings?
??x
Judge Waterman stated that when facts relate to a particular event and are undisclosed by those who know them, their materiality depends on balancing both the probability that the event will occur and the anticipated magnitude of the event in light of the company’s activity. In this case, knowledge of the potential for a large mineral discovery was considered material.
x??

#### Enforcement Challenges with Online Securities Fraud
Background context: The SEC faces challenges in enforcing antifraud provisions of securities laws in an online environment. Internet-related securities fraud includes many types of investment scams.

x??

---

#### Online Investment Newsletters and Fraud
Background context: While many online investment newsletters provide valuable information, some are used for fraud. Companies can pay these newsletters to tout their securities, but the law requires them to disclose this.

Regulatory oversight: The law allows companies to pay newsletters for advertising, but they must disclose who paid for it. However, many newsletters do not follow this requirement.
:p What is a potential issue with online investment newsletters?
??x
A significant issue is that even though the law allows companies to pay newsletters for advertising, many do not disclose who paid for the content. This can lead investors to believe the information is unbiased when in fact the fraudsters will profit by influencing investor behavior.

For example:
- A newsletter might recommend a particular stock.
- If the company pays for this recommendation and the investor buys or sells based on it, the company may benefit financially from the investor's actions without disclosing that payment.

The lack of disclosure can undermine investor trust and lead to misinformed investment decisions.
x??

---

#### Ponzi Schemes in Securities Fraud
Background context: Although much securities fraud occurs online, some schemes are still conducted offline. The SEC frequently files enforcement actions against perpetrators of Ponzi schemes.

Definition and operation: Ponzi schemes are fraudulent investment operations that pay returns to investors from new capital paid to the fraudsters rather than from a legitimate investment.

Examples: These schemes sometimes target U.S. residents and convince them to invest in offshore companies or banks.
:p What is a Ponzi scheme?
??x
A Ponzi scheme is a type of investment fraud where returns are paid to earlier investors using funds from later investors, rather than from any actual profit generated by legitimate business activities.

The operation typically works as follows:
1. The schemer promises high returns and attracts initial investments.
2. These initial returns are paid out to the early investors, giving them an appearance of legitimacy.
3. New investors' money is used to pay off earlier investors, perpetuating the illusion of profitability.

For example:
- An investor might be promised a 10% return on their investment every month.
- The schemer uses funds from new investors to pay these returns, which can continue as long as new investments are coming in.

The scheme is unsustainable because it cannot generate enough returns to keep paying out all the time and eventually collapses when there are not enough new investors.
x??

---

#### State Securities Laws
Background context: Every state has its own corporate securities laws, often referred to as "blue sky" laws. These laws regulate the offer and sale of securities within each state.

Historical origin: The term "blue sky" comes from a 1917 U.S. Supreme Court decision that stated such laws aim to prevent speculative schemes with no basis in reality.
:p What are state securities laws?
??x
State securities laws, often called "blue sky" laws, regulate the offer and sale of securities within each state's borders. These laws have historical roots in efforts to prevent speculative schemes without a legitimate foundation.

Key points:

#### Aligning Interests of Officers and Shareholders Through Stock Options
Background context: The text explains how some corporations have attempted to align the financial interests of their officers with those of shareholders by providing stock options. These options allow officers to purchase company shares at a fixed price, which can lead to profits if market prices rise.
:p What is the concept of stock options in corporate governance?
??x
Stock options are a form of compensation that enables executives to buy shares of the corporation's stock at a predetermined price (exercise price). If the share price increases above this exercise price, the officer can sell their shares for profit. This mechanism is intended to align the financial interests of officers with those of shareholders by encouraging them to work in the company’s best interest.
x??

---

#### Problems with Stock Options
Background context: Despite being a tool to motivate officers, stock options have been criticized for various issues, including executives' temptation to manipulate financial reports and companies re-pricing options to avoid losses when share prices drop.
:p What are some problems associated with stock options?
??x
Stock options can be problematic because they might incentivize executives to engage in unethical practices such as "cooking" the company’s books to maintain higher share prices. Additionally, if share prices fall, companies may re-price the options so that officers do not face financial losses, thus undermining their effectiveness in promoting shareholder interests.
x??

---

#### Role of Outside Directors
Background context: Due to the limitations of stock options, there has been a call for more independent directors who can better monitor corporate officers. The text explains that while outside directors are intended to be more independent, they may still have connections with leading officers, potentially affecting their objectivity.
:p Why is there an increase in demand for outside directors?
??x
The increase in demand for outside directors stems from the perceived shortcomings of stock options as a tool to align officer and shareholder interests. Critics argue that stock options can be manipulated by executives or companies, undermining their effectiveness. Therefore, having independent directors who do not have formal employment ties with the company is seen as a way to ensure more robust oversight.
x??

---

#### Promoting Accountability Through Corporate Governance
Background context: The text outlines how effective corporate governance aims to address issues like those mentioned earlier and motivate officers to make decisions that benefit shareholders. It emphasizes the need for structures such as boards of directors, audited financial reports, and legal protections for shareholders.
:p What are the key components of effective corporate governance?
??x
Effective corporate governance includes several key components:
1. Audited reporting of financial conditions to evaluate managers.
2. Legal protections for shareholders to hold violators accountable.
3. Boards of directors making major decisions about the corporation's future.

These structures help ensure that officers act in the best interests of shareholders.

#### Independent Monitoring and Senior Management Responsibilities
Background context: The Sarbanes-Oxley Act introduced significant corporate governance requirements, including independent monitoring of company officers by both the board of directors and auditors. Sections 302 and 404 specifically address senior management's responsibilities in establishing and maintaining an effective system of internal controls.

#### Exemptions for Smaller Companies
Background context: Initially, all public companies were required to have an independent auditor file a report on management’s assessment of internal controls with the SEC. However, this requirement was later eased for smaller companies to reduce compliance costs.

??x
Public companies with a market capitalization (public float) of less than $75 million no longer need to have an auditor report on management’s assessment of internal controls.

#### Certification and Monitoring Requirements
Background context: Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires chief executive officers (CEOs) and chief financial officers (CFOs) to certify the accuracy of corporate financial statements. Additionally, it enhances directors' monitoring responsibilities through specific requirements for audit committees.

:p What is required of CEOs and CFOs under Section 906?
