#### Garnishment Order and Enforcement
Background context: After learning about the sale of the house, the trustee obtained a writ of garnishment on Tinsley's and his trust’s bank accounts. Despite numerous objections from Tinsley, SunTrust Bank eventually complied with the order.

Background context: The text highlights that both federal and state laws limit the amount that can be taken from a debtor’s weekly take-home pay through garnishment proceedings.

:p What is the purpose of limiting wage garnishment amounts?
??x
The purpose of limiting wage garnishment amounts is to protect debtors from losing all their income, ensuring they retain a basic level of financial stability.

#### Background of Ritu Madhok's Foreclosure Case
Ritu Madhok borrowed $213,069 from Banc of California, N.A., to buy a house in Iselin, New Jersey. She defaulted on her mortgage ten months after taking out the loan by stopping payments. The lender initiated foreclosure proceedings.
:p What is the background context of Ritu Madhok's case?
??x
The context involves a borrower who defaulted on her mortgage due to non-payment. After several months, the lender filed for foreclosure in a New Jersey state court and obtained a writ for a sheriff’s sale. The court initially granted the bank’s request but later postponed the sale to allow the borrower an opportunity to submit a loss mitigation package.

#### Sheriff's Sale
After postponing the sheriff's sale for three months, it proceeded with Madhok submitting only a partial and incomplete loss mitigation package. The sale went ahead as scheduled.
:p What happened during the sheriff's sale?
??x
During the sheriff's sale, after a three-month postponement to allow Madhok to submit a loss mitigation package, she provided an incomplete and partial package just before the scheduled sale date. Despite this, the sale proceeded according to plan.
x??

---

#### Motion to Vacate Sheriff's Sale
More than a month later, Madhok filed a motion to vacate the sheriff’s sale, arguing that the court should not have allowed the sale to go ahead despite her incomplete application.
:p What did Madhok do after the sheriff's sale?
??x
After the sheriff's sale, which took place more than a month after she was given an opportunity to submit a loss mitigation package, Madhok filed a motion to vacate the sale. She argued that the court should not have allowed the sale because her application was incomplete.
x??

---

#### Court’s Denial of Motion
The court denied Madhok's motion to vacate the sale, and she appealed the decision, arguing an abuse of discretion by the court.
:p What did the court decide regarding Madhok's motion?
??x
The court denied Madhok's motion to vacate the sheriff's sale. She then appealed, claiming that the trial court abused its discretion in denying her motion.
x??

---

#### Standard for Abusing Discretion
In New Jersey, a motion to vacate a sheriff’s sale is governed by Rule 4:65-5, which requires objections to be filed within ten days of the sale or before conveyance. The court has discretion to set aside a sale if there are valid independent grounds for equitable relief.
:p What standard does the New Jersey state court use in ruling on motions to vacate sheriff’s sales?
??x
The New Jersey state court uses Rule 4:65-5 as the standard for determining whether a motion to vacate a sheriff's sale should be granted. This rule stipulates that any objection must be filed within ten days of the sale or before conveyance, and the trial court has discretion to set aside the sale if there are valid independent grounds for equitable relief.
x??

#### Court’s Ruling
The appellate court found no abuse of discretion by the trial court in denying Madhok's motion. It stated that despite her default, she procrastinated until just before the sheriff's sale and submitted an incomplete loss mitigation application.
:p How did the appellate court rule on Madhok's appeal?
??x
The appellate court ruled that there was no abuse of discretion by the trial court in denying Madhok’s motion to vacate the sheriff's sale. The ruling stated that despite her default, she delayed submitting a complete loss mitigation application until almost the day before the scheduled sale.
x??

#### Conclusion on Discretionary Power
The appellate court emphasized that while trial courts have broad discretion to use equitable remedies, this power should be used sparingly and only when necessary to correct plain injustice. In Madhok's case, her actions did not justify vacating the sheriff's sale.
:p What conclusion did the appellate court reach regarding its discretionary powers?
??x
The appellate court concluded that despite having broad discretion in applying equitable remedies, this power should be exercised sparingly and only when necessary to correct a clear injustice. In Madhok’s case, her actions of procrastination until just before the sale and submitting an incomplete loss mitigation application did not warrant vacating the sheriff's sale.

#### Suretyship and Guaranty Definition
Background context: In a suretyship or guaranty arrangement, a third party promises to be responsible for a debtor's obligations. A surety is someone who agrees to be fully responsible for the debt even if the primary debtor does not default. A guarantor, on the other hand, is secondarily responsible and only becomes liable when the principal debtor defaults.

:p Define a surety in terms of their liability.
??x
A surety is a third party who promises to be primarily liable for the debt of the principal debtor. The creditor can demand payment from the surety immediately upon the due date of the debt, without exhausting all legal remedies against the principal debtor first.
x??
---

---
#### Guarantor vs. Surety
Background context: A guarantor is a third party who agrees to be secondarily responsible for the debt—that is, only becomes liable if the primary debtor defaults. Traditionally, suretyship agreements did not require a writing to be enforceable, but today some states do require a written agreement.

:p How does a guarantor's liability compare to that of a surety?
??x
A guarantor is secondarily responsible for the debt and only becomes liable when the primary debtor defaults. In contrast, a surety is primarily liable from the moment the debt is due.
x??

---
#### Writing Requirements for Guaranty Agreements
Background context: A guaranty must be in writing to be enforceable under the Statute of Frauds, unless its main purpose is to benefit the guarantor. This statutory requirement ensures that important agreements are not forged or fraudulent.

:p What does the Statute of Frauds require regarding guaranty agreements?
??x
The Statute of Frauds requires a written agreement for a guaranty to be enforceable, unless the primary purpose of the agreement is to benefit the guarantor.
x??

#### Example of Suretyship Agreement
Background context: In suretyship, the third party (surety) promises to pay if the principal debtor does not. The example provided illustrates this relationship by showing how a father cosigns his son's loan.

:p Describe the scenario in Example 29.4.
??x
Roberto Delmar wants to borrow money from the bank to buy a used car but is unable to secure the loan due to his college status. His father, José Delmar, who has dealt with the bank before, agrees to cosign the note, thereby becoming a surety for Roberto's debt.

When José Delmar cosigns the note, he becomes primarily liable to the bank. On the due date of the loan, the bank can seek payment from either Roberto or José Delmar, or both jointly.

#### Suretyship vs. Guaranty
Background context: Traditionally, suretyship agreements were not required to be in writing, but today some states require a written agreement for enforcement. Common law also distinguished between the liability of a surety and a guarantor, though many modern states have abolished these distinctions.

:p What are the traditional differences between suretyship and guaranty?
??x
Traditionally, in common law, there were significant differences in the liability of a surety and a guarantor. A surety was primarily liable for the debt from the moment it became due, while a guarantor was secondarily liable and only became responsible after the principal debtor defaulted.

Today, some states require a written agreement for a suretyship to be enforceable, whereas a guaranty must always be in writing under the Statute of Frauds unless its primary purpose is to benefit the guarantor.

#### Suretyship Obligation Voidability Due to Fraud
A surety can assert fraud as a defense under certain conditions. In most states, the creditor must inform the surety of material facts before forming the suretyship contract that would significantly increase the surety's risk. Failure to disclose such information could render the suretyship obligation voidable.
:p What does a surety need to be informed about by the creditor to potentially avoid their obligation?
??x
If the creditor fails to inform the surety of material facts that substantially increase the surety's risk, the surety can use this as a defense to void the suretyship agreement. The specific material facts could include financial status, project risks, or other critical information.
x??
---
#### Right of Subrogation
The surety has the legal right of subrogation, which allows them to stand in the shoes of the creditor and pursue any remedies that were available to the creditor against the debtor. This includes rights related to bankruptcy, collateral possession by the creditor, and rights to judgments obtained by the creditor.
:p What does a surety gain through the right of subrogation?
??x
A surety gains the right to pursue any remedies that the creditor had against the debtor. This includes rights in bankruptcy, rights to collateral, and rights to judgments obtained by the creditor.
x??
---
#### Right of Reimbursement
The surety has a right of reimbursement from the debtor for all outlays made on behalf of the suretyship arrangement. Outlays can include expenses and the actual amount paid to the creditor.
:p What does the surety gain through the right of reimbursement?
??x
The surety gains the right to receive from the debtor all outlays made on behalf of the suretyship arrangement, including both expenses and the actual amount of debt paid to the creditor.
x??
---
#### Right of Contribution Among Co-Sureties
Two or more sureties are called co-sureties. When a co-surety pays more than their proportionate share due to a debtor's default, they have a right of contribution. This means the co-surety can recover from other co-sureties the amount paid above their obligation.
:p What is the right of contribution?
??x
The right of contribution allows a co-surety who has paid more than their proportionate share to recover that excess payment from the other co-sureties. The liability of each surety is generally determined by agreement or, in its absence, set at the maximum liability under the suretyship contract.
