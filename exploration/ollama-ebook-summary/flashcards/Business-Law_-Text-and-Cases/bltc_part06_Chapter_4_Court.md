#### Inquiry and Reporting
Background context: As Dickman’s supervisor, you have been informed that she is frequently away from her desk and often makes personal phone calls. The first step of using the IDDR method involves inquiry, where questions are asked to gather information.

:p Should you report your findings to management based on the complaints about Dickman?
??x
You should consider reporting your findings to management if there is sufficient evidence suggesting wrongdoing. However, it's important to follow a fair and ethical process. Gather more detailed information through interviews or further documentation before making any reports. This ensures that you are acting ethically and not hastily accusing an employee.

```java
public class EthicsInquiry {
    public void inquireEmployee(HashMap<String, String> complaints) {
        // Log the complaints and gather more evidence before reporting.
        System.out.println("Gathering more information from sources.");
    }
}
```

#### Ethical Problems in Investigating and Firing
Background context: The Health Center would need substantial evidence to justify firing Dickman. You are uncertain about whether you can search her computer, which raises ethical concerns.

:p Is it fair to terminate an employee who is under disability restrictions?
??x
Terminating an employee due to suspicions of wrongdoing during a period of disability is problematic. Ethically, the Health Center should ensure that any investigation respects Dickman's rights and does not violate her privacy unless there is clear evidence of misuse of state resources.

```java
public class FairnessCheck {
    public boolean isFairToTerminate(Employee employee) {
        if (employee.isOnDisability()) {
            return false; // Not fair to terminate during disability.
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

#### Ethical Dilemma and Stakeholders
Background context: The Health Center faces an ethical dilemma involving allegations of harassment, retaliation, and misuse of state resources. Various parties are affected by these decisions.

:p Who are the stakeholders in this case?
??x
The stakeholders include:
- Dickman (the employee)
- The University of Connecticut Health Center
- The State of Connecticut (regarding its investigation and legal actions)
- Patients who might be affected by Dickman’s absence or misconduct

```java
public class Stakeholders {
    public List<String> identifyStakeholders() {
        return Arrays.asList("Dickman", "University of Connecticut Health Center", 
                             "State of Connecticut", "Patients");
    }
}
```

#### Ethical Theories in Decision-Making
Background context: To guide your decision, you might use various ethical theories such as utilitarianism, deontology, or virtue ethics.

:p Which ethical theories would you use to guide your decision?
??x
You could apply:
- **Utilitarianism**: Focus on the greatest good for the greatest number. Consider the impact of Dickman’s actions on patients and the overall functioning of the Health Center.
- **Deontology**: Emphasize duty and rights, ensuring that any actions taken respect ethical principles like privacy and fairness.
- **Virtue Ethics**: Assess whether your actions reflect virtuous qualities such as honesty, fairness, and compassion.

```java
public class EthicalTheories {
    public String chooseEthicalTheory() {
        return "Utilitarianism"; // Example choice, could be adjusted based on context.
    }
}
```

#### Dickman’s Perspective
Background context: Dickman is a long-time employee experiencing severe back pain and engaging in side businesses to compensate for the inability to perform her job fully.

:p How would you frame the ethical dilemma that the Health Center faced?
??x
The ethical dilemma involves balancing the need to maintain workplace integrity, protect patient safety, respect employee rights, and address Dickman’s situation fairly. The Health Center must decide whether to investigate further based on current evidence or consider alternative measures like reasonable accommodation.

```java
public class EthicalDilemma {
    public void frameDilemma() {
        System.out.println("Balance between workplace integrity, patient safety, employee rights.");
    }
}
```

#### Judicial Review
Background context explaining the concept. The judiciary can decide whether laws or actions of other branches are constitutional, and this process is known as judicial review.
The power of judicial review enables the courts to act as a check on the legislative and executive branches.
:p What is judicial review?
??x
Judicial review is the process by which courts interpret and apply laws to specific situations. It allows the judiciary to decide whether actions or laws of other branches are constitutional, serving as a crucial check within the system of checks and balances established by the U.S. Constitution.

Background context explaining the concept. The United States Supreme Court explicitly established the power of judicial review in 1803 through the case Marbury v. Madison. This decision affirmed that it is the duty of the judiciary to interpret the law and decide on the operation of conflicting laws.
:p What did the U.S. Supreme Court establish in the case Marbury v. Madison?
??x
The U.S. Supreme Court established the power of judicial review in the case Marbury v. Madison (1803). The decision stated that it is the province and duty of the Judicial Department to say what the law is, and if two laws conflict, the courts must decide on their operation.

#### American Court Systems
Background context explaining the concept. The United States has fifty-two court systems, including one for each of the fifty states, one for the District of Columbia, and a federal system. These are independent systems derived from Article III, Section 2, of the U.S. Constitution.
By the power given to it under the U.S. Constitution, Congress has extended the federal court system to territories like Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.
:p What does the United States have in terms of its court systems?
??x
The United States has fifty-two court systems: one for each of the fifty states, one for the District of Columbia, and a federal system. These are independent systems derived from Article III, Section 2, of the U.S. Constitution.

#### Federal vs State Courts
Background context explaining the concept. The federal courts are not superior to state courts; they are simply an independent system that derives its authority from Article III, Section 2, of the U.S. Constitution. Congress has extended the federal court system to territories like Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.
:p What is the relationship between federal and state courts?
??x
The federal courts and state courts are not superior to each other; they are independent systems derived from different parts of the U.S. Constitution. Federal courts derive their authority from Article III, Section 2, while state courts derive theirs from state constitutions.
In territories like Guam and the Virgin Islands, territorial courts serve as both federal and state courts, whereas in Puerto Rico, they serve only as federal courts.

---

#### Arbitration Process
Background context explaining the concept. In business disputes, parties often choose to resolve their issues through arbitration rather than litigation. Arbitration involves a neutral third party who makes a decision based on evidence presented by both sides.
:p What is arbitration?
??x
Arbitration is a process where a neutral third party (the arbitrator) makes a decision based on the evidence and arguments presented by both parties in a dispute. This process can be chosen as an alternative to traditional litigation, offering faster resolution and confidentiality.

#### DSMC Business Scenario
Background context explaining the concept. In the scenario, Evan Heron, a top executive at Des Moines Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (DSMC), negotiates lucrative contracts with companies like Apple, Inc., for mobile phone processors. A dispute arises between DSMC and one of its customers, involving overcharged chips.
:p What is the business situation in this scenario?
??x
The business situation involves a dispute between DSMC and a Canadian smartphone company regarding overcharged chips. The dispute was resolved through arbitration instead of litigation, with the arbitration panel awarding the Canadian company $800 million for the overcharge.

#### Effect of Diversity of Citizenship on Lawsuits
Background context: The presence or lack of diversity of citizenship affects whether a lawsuit can proceed in federal courts. Diversity of citizenship requires that there be no citizens of different states on both sides of the dispute.

:p How does the diversity of citizenship affect a lawsuit?
??x
Diversity of citizenship is crucial for a case to be heard in federal court under the U.S. Constitution's requirement for diversity jurisdiction. This means that all parties on one side of a lawsuit must be citizens of different states than any party on the other side.

If there is no diversity, the case may have to be heard in state courts or may be dismissed if it involves significant monetary claims and federal court filing fees.
x??

---
#### Court's Conclusion on Diversity of Citizenship
Background context: In this case, Mala challenged Crown Bay’s citizenship status. The court concluded that because Mala did not present credible evidence supporting Crown Bay as a Florida citizen, the parties were not diverse.

:p What was the court’s conclusion regarding diversity of citizenship?
??x
The court concluded that the parties were not diverse in terms of their citizenship status. Since Mala failed to provide any credible evidence indicating that Crown Bay was a Florida citizen, it could not be proven that all plaintiffs and defendants were citizens of different states.

Therefore, because the parties lacked diversity of citizenship, Mala did not have a right to a jury trial.
x??

---
#### Concurrent vs. Exclusive Jurisdiction
Background context: When both federal and state courts can hear a case due to diversity of citizenship, concurrent jurisdiction exists. This means either court is eligible for the case. However, when only one type of court can handle certain cases (like federal crimes or bankruptcy), exclusive jurisdiction applies.

:p What are the differences between concurrent and exclusive jurisdiction?
??x
Concurrent jurisdiction allows both federal and state courts to hear a diversity case, whereas exclusive jurisdiction restricts the case to either federal or state courts based on specific types of disputes. For example, federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over cases involving federal crimes and bankruptcy.

In the context of diversity, if there is concurrent jurisdiction, parties can choose which court to file their lawsuit in, considering factors like available remedies or the judge’s reputation.

#### Jurisdiction in Cyberspace
Background context: The Internet challenges traditional concepts of personal jurisdiction because a defendant's mere presence on a website might not be enough for a court to assert jurisdiction. Courts use a "sliding-scale" standard to determine when they can exercise jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant based on their Web activities.

:p How does the concept of jurisdiction in cyberspace work?
??x
Jurisdiction in cyberspace is determined by a sliding-scale approach that considers the level and type of interaction between a defendant's website and users within a specific state. The standard involves three types of Internet business contacts:
1. **Substantial Business**: If the defendant conducts significant online transactions or has a substantial commercial presence on the internet, jurisdiction may be appropriate.
2. **Minimal Contact**: For lighter interactions, such as minimal sales or contract negotiations, jurisdiction is more difficult to establish.
3. **No Contacts**: If there are no meaningful connections between the defendant and users within the state, jurisdiction would likely not be applicable.

This approach helps balance the interests of plaintiffs in asserting their claims while respecting defendants' due process rights.

#### Change of Venue
Background context explaining the concept. The Internet and 24/7 news reporting have reduced the significance of a venue for trials, as everyone has instant access to the same information about a purported crime. Courts now rarely grant requests for a change of venue because it is believed that no community is more or less informed or prejudiced against a defendant.
:p What does the reduction in the importance of venues for trials due to modern technology suggest?
??x
The reduction suggests that with widespread and instantaneous access to information, it's less likely for any particular community to be significantly more informed or biased compared to others regarding a specific case. This has led courts to believe that moving a trial to another venue is not necessary.

#### Standing to Sue
Background context explaining the concept. Before a party can bring a lawsuit to court, they must have standing—meaning they need to have a legally protected interest at stake in the litigation. This involves three elements: harm, causation, and remedy.
:p What is required for a party to have standing to sue?
??x
For a party to have standing to sue, they must satisfy three key elements:
1. Harm: The party must have suffered an invasion of a legally protected interest or face imminent harm.
2. Causation: There must be a direct link between the defendant's conduct and the injury.
3. Remedy: It must be likely that a favorable court decision can remedy the injury.

#### Case in Point 4.5
Background context explaining the concept. Harold Wagner sued M.S.T. Mortgage Group, claiming improper assignment of the mortgage loan. The federal district court ruled that Wagner lacked standing because under Texas law, only directly involved parties could challenge the validity of an assignment.
:p Why did Wagner lack standing to contest the assignment?
??x
Wagner lacked standing because he was not a direct party involved in the assignment. According to Texas law, only the parties directly involved in an assignment can challenge its validity. Since the assignment occurred between two lenders and didn't directly involve Wagner, he had no standing to bring the lawsuit.

#### State Court Systems
Background context explaining the concept. Each state has its own court system that includes several levels of courts: trial courts of limited jurisdiction, trial courts of general jurisdiction, appellate courts (intermediate), and the state’s highest court (often called the state supreme court). The federal court system also follows a similar structure.
:p What are the main tiers of a typical state court system?
??x
A typical state court system includes four main tiers:
1. Trial Courts of Limited Jurisdiction: These handle minor cases such as traffic violations and small claims.
2. Trial Courts of General Jurisdiction: These handle most civil and criminal cases.
3. Appellate Courts (Intermediate): These review decisions from lower courts to ensure proper application of the law.
4. State’s Highest Court (Often Called the State Supreme Court): This is the final court of appeal for state-level legal issues.

#### TWC Decision and Johnson's Claim
Johnson argues that she was denied full adjudication of her claim because the Texas Workers' Compensation Commission (TWC) refused to consider her arguments at the administrative level as beyond its jurisdiction. The relevant excerpt from the decision states: "The TWC does not interpret contracts between employers and employee but only enforces the Texas Payday Law." According to Johnson, this language indicates that the TWC refused to address the merits of the issue she raised.

:p What is the primary argument made by Johnson regarding the TWC's refusal to consider her claim?
??x
Johnson claims that the TWC denied full adjudication of her breach of contract claim because they explicitly stated they do not interpret contracts between employers and employees, thus refusing to address whether Oxy violated its own Educational Assistance Policy.

The decision from the TWC indicates their role is limited to enforcing the Texas Payday Law, which does not include interpreting employer-employee contracts. As a result, Johnson's argument centers on the fact that this refusal means the key issue of fact (whether Oxy violated its policy) was not addressed by the TWC.

x??

---

#### Res Judicata and Johnson’s Case
The defendants argue that Johnson’s claims are barred by res judicata because they were previously decided by the TWC. However, in Johnson's case, the TWC did not decide the key question of fact—whether Oxy violated its Educational Assistance Policy when it withheld Johnson’s final wages. The TWC explicitly refused to address this issue.

The appellate court ruled that because the TWC order does not address the Educational Assistance Policy and explicitly refuses to interpret contracts between employers and employees, res judicata does not bar Johnson's breach of contract claim. 

:p According to the appellate court, why can't res judicata bar Johnson’s claim?
??x
Res judicata cannot bar Johnson's claim because the TWC order did not address the key question of fact—whether Oxy violated its Educational Assistance Policy when it withheld Johnson's final wages. The TWC explicitly refused to interpret contracts between employers and employees, thus failing to decide this critical issue.

The appellate court reasoned that since this question is central to Johnson’s breach of contract claim, it has not been resolved by the TWC, meaning res judicata does not apply in this case.

x??

---

#### Appellate Court's Decision
The state intermediate appellate court reversed the lower court's decision. The court noted that the TWC did not decide the key question of fact—whether Oxy violated its Educational Assistance Policy when it withheld Johnson’s final wages. They explicitly refused to address this issue, stating that they "do not interpret contracts between employers and employee."

The appellate court remanded the case for a trial on the merits.

:p What was the outcome of the appeal in Johnson's case?
??x
The state intermediate appellate court reversed the lower court's decision by ruling that the TWC did not decide the key question of fact—whether Oxy violated its Educational Assistance Policy when it withheld Johnson’s final wages. The court explicitly refused to interpret contracts between employers and employees, thus failing to address this critical issue.

As a result, the case was remanded for a trial on the merits.

#### Legal Environment: Questions of Fact vs. Law
In legal proceedings, questions of fact are typically decided by juries or judges based on evidence presented, while questions of law are interpreted and ruled upon by judges. The TWC's decision in this case involved interpreting laws rather than resolving factual disputes between the parties.

:p Can you explain the difference between questions of fact and questions of law?
??x
Questions of fact are determined based on the evidence presented and involve matters that can be proven true or false through testimony, documents, and other evidence. Questions of law, on the other hand, involve interpreting the legal principles applicable to a case.

In this scenario, the TWC's decision focused on enforcing the Texas Payday Law, which is a question of law. They did not interpret the educational assistance policy as it was beyond their jurisdiction, indicating that questions of contract interpretation are considered factual issues for other forums.

#### Global Legal Environment: Foreign Law
In some cases, courts may need to determine and interpret the laws of foreign countries. States vary in how they classify this issue—some consider it a question of fact, while federal rules treat it as a question of law. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure state that issues regarding foreign law are questions of law.

:p In what situations might a court need to interpret the laws of a foreign country?
??x
Courts may need to interpret the laws of a foreign country in cases involving international business transactions, disputes between parties from different countries, or when a foreign entity is involved. The interpretation and application of these foreign laws can significantly impact legal proceedings.

In this context, whether an issue regarding foreign law is treated as a question of fact or law depends on the specific rules governing each case. Federal courts generally consider such issues questions of law under their procedural rules.
