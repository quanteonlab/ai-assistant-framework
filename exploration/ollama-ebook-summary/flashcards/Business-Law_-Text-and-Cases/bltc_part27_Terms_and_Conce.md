#### Quasi Contract Overview
Quasi contract is a legal theory where an obligation arises even though there is no actual agreement between parties. The court may impose such an obligation to prevent one party from unjustly benefiting at another's expense. This concept allows recovery when there is no formal contract but justice demands compensation.
:p What is the primary purpose of quasi contracts?
??x
The primary purpose of quasi contracts is to ensure that a party does not unjustly benefit from another party’s actions, even in the absence of an actual agreement or contract. The court may impose such obligations to prevent unfair enrichment and to ensure fair compensation for benefits conferred.

#### When Quasi Contract Is Used
Quasi contract can be used when there is no formal contract between parties regarding a matter of controversy. However, if there is an enforceable contract on the same issue, quasi contract will not apply. It may also come into play when a contract exists but is unenforceable for some reason.
:p In what situations might a court use quasi contracts?
??x
A court uses quasi contracts in situations where no actual agreement exists between parties concerning a matter of controversy. Quasi contracts are applied when there is no enforceable contract or when an existing contract is unenforceable due to certain reasons, such as the writing requirement not being met.

#### Requirements for Quasi Contract
To recover under quasi contract, several conditions must be met:
1. The party has conferred a benefit on the other party.
2. The party expected to be paid for the benefit.
3. The party did not act as a volunteer in providing the benefit.
4. It would be unjust for the recipient to retain the benefit without paying.
:p What are the four conditions necessary to recover under quasi contract?
??x
The four conditions necessary to recover under quasi contract are:
1. The party must have conferred a benefit on the other party.
2. The conferring party must have expected to be paid for the benefit.
3. The conferring party should not have acted as a volunteer in providing the benefit.
4. It would be unjust for the recipient to retain the benefit without paying.

#### Example of Quasi Contract
In Example 19.15, Ericson builds one oil derrick for Petro Industries but does not get paid after completing it. Despite no formal contract being written, because of the partial performance and the unenforceability issue, Ericson can sue under quasi contract.
:p In Example 19.15, why can Ericson sue Petro Industries?
??x
In Example 19.15, Ericson can sue Petro Industries under the theory of quasi contract because all conditions for quasi-contractual recovery have been met:
- Ericson conferred a benefit (building one oil derrick) on Petro Industries.
- He built the derrick with the expectation of being paid.
- He did not act as a volunteer.
- It would be unjust for Petro Industries to retain the benefit without paying.

#### Benefits and Detriment Measurement
The amount recovered in quasi contract may be measured either by the benefit received or by the detriment suffered. This means that if it's easier, the court might measure the recovery based on what was given rather than what could have been lost.
:p How is the amount of recovery typically determined in a quasi contract?
??x
The amount of recovery in a quasi contract is typically determined either by the benefit received or by the detriment suffered. The choice depends on which measurement provides a fairer and more accurate assessment of the value exchanged between parties. If one measure is simpler, courts may use it to determine the compensation.

#### Unenforceable Contracts
Contracts that cannot be performed within one year must be in writing to be enforceable. This rule is crucial as it dictates when quasi contracts might apply if an unenforceable contract exists due to its time constraint.
:p What does the writing requirement for long-term contracts imply?
??x
The writing requirement for long-term contracts implies that any agreement that cannot be performed within one year must be in writing to be enforceable. If such a contract is not written, it may become unenforceable, leading to situations where quasi contracts can be used to recover the value of benefits conferred.

#### Consequential Damages
Consequential damages are those that are a natural result of a breach but are not directly caused by it. They can include losses such as lost profits, business interruption, or extra expenses incurred because of the breach.

:p What is consequential damages and provide an example?
??x
Consequential damages refer to losses that arise naturally from a breach of contract, which are not direct results of the breaching party’s actions but rather indirect consequences. For instance, if Greg builds only half the storage shed for Haney, and Haney incurs additional costs by hiring Ipswich to complete the job, these additional costs would be considered consequential damages.

x??
---
#### Incidental Damages
Incidental damages are expenses directly resulting from a breach of contract, which include things like the cost of transporting goods back to their rightful owner or costs incurred in finding substitute performance. These are often recoverable if not specifically excluded by the contract terms.

:p What is an example of incidental damages?
??x
If Lyle delays transferring his ranch to Marley, causing her to incur expenses for providing care to cattle that he bought expecting to take possession immediately on June 1st, these expenses would be considered incidental damages. These costs are directly related to the breach and can be recovered by Marley from Lyle.

x??
---
#### Liquidated Damages
Liquidated damages are a predetermined sum agreed upon in a contract as compensation for breach of that contract. The amount is intended to cover the estimated loss or damage, not as a penalty.

:p What does liquidated damages mean and provide an example?
??x
Liquidated damages are a pre-agreed payment specified in a contract to be paid if one party breaches the agreement. For instance, when Cohen contracts with Windsor to sell his house for $100,000 and specifies that Windsor must pay 10% as a down payment, he can retain this sum if Windsor breaches the contract.

In the given example:
- Cohen retains $10,000 (10% of$100,000) as liquidated damages when Windsor breaches the contract.
- Two weeks later, Cohen sells the house to Ballard for $105,000. Even though the breach happened, Cohen is not required to return the$10,000 because it was specified in the contract.

#### Mitigation of Damages
Mitigation refers to efforts by a non-breaching party to minimize losses resulting from a breach of contract. This includes taking reasonable steps to find an alternative remedy that is less costly than full performance under the original agreement.

:p What is mitigation of damages and provide an example?
??x
Mitigation involves the non-breaching party taking reasonable actions to reduce their loss after a breach occurs. For instance, if Greg breaches his contract with Haney by only completing half the storage shed work, Haney must take steps like hiring Ipswich to finish the job at minimal cost.

In this scenario:
- If Haney can hire Ipswich for $500 instead of having to pay more due to delays or other complications, she has effectively mitigated her damages. Failing to do so could reduce the amount recoverable from Greg.

#### Nominal Damages
Nominal damages are a small sum awarded to acknowledge that a breach occurred but there was minimal actual loss. These are typically $1 and serve as proof of legal wrong.

:p What is nominal damages and provide an example?
??x
Nominal damages represent a symbolic award given when no actual loss can be proven, acknowledging the wrongdoing but not compensating for substantial damage. For instance:
- If a contract breach causes no real financial harm to one party, they might still sue to obtain nominal damages (e.g., $1) as proof of the breach.

x??
---
#### Penalty
A penalty is an excessive sum agreed upon in a contract that serves more as a deterrent than actual compensation. It often goes beyond reasonable damages and can be unenforceable if deemed punitive or unreasonable.

:p What is a penalty and provide an example?
??x
Penalties are stipulations within contracts that impose harsh financial consequences for breaching the agreement, often intended to deter such breaches. For instance:
- In the case of Bruno’s contract with X Entertainment, the $1 million liquidated damages provision might be considered a penalty if it is excessively high and meant more as punishment rather than compensation.

#### Quantum Meruit
Quantum meruit is a legal remedy that allows one party to receive payment for work performed under an implied or oral agreement when no formal contract exists. The amount owed is based on the fair market value of the work completed.

:p What does quantum meruit mean and provide an example?
??x
Quantum meruit means "as much as deserved" in Latin, referring to a situation where one party performs services for another without a formal agreement but seeks payment for those services. For example:
- If Amy signs on to perform at Fred’s nightclub for $100 per day and works 20 days, she can seek quantum meruit damages if the contract is terminated unexpectedly.

x??

#### Reformation
Reformation is a legal remedy that allows a court to correct an agreement by making it conform more accurately with the parties' original intentions. This may involve changing terms or adding clauses where necessary to reflect the true intent of the contracting parties.

:p What is reformation and provide an example?
??x
Reformation is a judicial process used when there has been a mutual mistake, fraud, or misrepresentation in a contract that needs correction. For instance:
- If Thompson contracts with Cousteau for her house but mistakenly signs on behalf of her brother, a court might order the reformation to correct this error and ensure it reflects the true intent.

x??
---
#### Restitution
Restitution is an equitable remedy aimed at putting one party back in the position they were before receiving something from another. It focuses on returning what was given or restoring the status quo ante.

:p What does restitution mean and provide an example?
??x
Restitution involves returning a benefit that has been conferred without consideration to put both parties in their original positions. For instance:
- If Amy performs at Fred’s nightclub for one month as per the contract but is terminated early, she may seek restitution for the value of her performance time.

x??
---
#### Specific Performance
Specific performance is an equitable remedy ordering a party to fulfill their obligations exactly as stated in the contract. It involves compelling someone to do something specific rather than paying money damages.

:p What is specific performance and provide examples?
??x
Specific performance orders a party to carry out their contractual obligations precisely as agreed. Examples include:
- (a) Thompson contracts to sell her house to Cousteau but later breaches by selling it to another buyer at a higher price. In this case, the court might order Thompson to sell the property to Cousteau specifically.
- (b) Amy is contracted to perform in Fred’s nightclub for one month and refuses; specific performance would compel Amy to fulfill her contractual obligation.

x??

#### Waiver
Waiver is an intentional relinquishment of a known right. Once waived, a party cannot later claim that right was never given up unless explicitly reinstated or the other party agrees to it in writing.

:p What does waiver mean and provide an example?
??x
Waiver involves intentionally giving up a legal right. For instance:
- If Bruno breaches his contract with X Entertainment but later waives this breach, he cannot then claim damages for non-performance under that agreement.

#### Minors and Contract Voidability
Background context: The question deals with the validity of a contract made by a minor. In general, contracts entered into by minors are voidable rather than void. A void contract is not legally binding from the outset; however, a voidable contract can be ratified or disaffirmed.

Minors have the legal right to disaffirm (revoke) the contract at any time before they attain majority age, which is 18 in this case.

:p Is the contract between Corelli and Shelley void or voidable?
??x
The contract is voidable. This means that it is not automatically null from the start but can be disaffirmed by Corelli as a minor. Since Corelli decides to disaffirm the contract after reaching majority age, he can legally request the return of his $2,500 payment.

If Corelli sues Shelley for recovery of the $2,500, the court is likely to rule in favor of Corelli because minors have the right to disaffirm contracts. The court will order Shelley to return the money.

#### Statute of Frauds
Background context: Oral contracts involving the sale of goods above a certain value (typically $500) are subject to the Statute of Frauds, which requires such agreements to be in writing to be enforceable.

:p Is the contract between Corelli and Shelley enforceable if it is oral?
??x
The contract is not enforceable because it involves the sale of a painting, which is a good that exceeds $500 in value. The Statute of Frauds requires such agreements to be in writing for them to be enforceable.

Shelley's subsequent sale of the painting to someone else does not make her contract with Corelli any more enforceable because it was never legally binding due to non-compliance with the Statute of Frauds.
x??

#### Capacity
Background context: Contracts entered into by adults are generally valid and enforceable unless there is evidence that one party lacked capacity at the time the contract was formed. Mental incompetence or incapacity can render a contract voidable if it can be proven that the contracting party did not understand the nature of their actions.

:p Is the contract between Corelli and Shelley enforceable given Corelli’s son's claim?
??x
The contract is not necessarily enforceable because there is evidence suggesting that Corelli was mentally incompetent when he signed the agreement. If Corelli was acting irrationally and unable to fully comprehend the transaction, his actions could be deemed invalid.

In such a scenario, a court would likely investigate whether Corelli had the mental capacity to enter into the contract. If it is determined that he did not, the contract can be voided or disaffirmed.
x??

#### Impossibility of Performance
Background context: Impossibility of performance refers to a situation where the subject matter of a contract has become impossible due to some unforeseen event beyond the control of either party. The impossibility must make it objectively impossible for one or both parties to perform their obligations.

:p What is the likely outcome if Corelli sues Shelley for $1,500 in damages?
??x
Shelley will win this lawsuit because the performance became objectively impossible due to her mother's illness requiring care. The fact that Corelli has already arranged to sell the painting does not change the legal assessment of the contract.

If the contract calls for delivering a specific piece of work, and that work becomes unfeasible due to circumstances beyond control (such as personal emergencies), the performing party may be excused from their obligations.
x??

---

#### Agreement in E-Contracts
Background context: Electronic contracts are governed by specific laws and agreements. A forum-selection clause specifies where legal disputes arising out of an agreement must be resolved.

:p Does Shelley have to honor Corelli’s request for a court in Texas?
??x
No, Shelley does not need to honor Corelli's request because the contract includes a forum-selection clause that directs any disputes to a California court. This clause is typically enforceable unless it can be proven to be unconscionable or one-sided.

Corelli should file his lawsuit in a California court as specified by the agreement on Shelley’s website.
