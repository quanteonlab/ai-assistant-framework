#### Creditors' Rights and Bankruptcy Practice: Secured Transactions
Background context explaining the concept. Paul Barton owned a small property-management company, doing business as Brighton Homes. He bought several items under installment sales contracts but defaulted on his payments when his business failed.
:p For which of Barton’s purchases (the surround-sound system, the kayak, the 4-Runner, and the iMacs) would the creditor need to file a financing statement to perfect its security interest?
??x
The creditors for each item purchased by Barton under an installment sales contract would need to file a financing statement to perfect their security interests. This includes KDM Electronics (for the surround-sound system and iMac computers), Outdoor Outfitters (for the kayak), and Bridgeport Auto (for the 4-Runner).
x??

---

#### Effect of Incomplete Debtor Name on Financing Statement
Background context explaining the concept. Barton's contract for the office computers mentioned only the name Brighton Homes. If KDM Electronics filed a financing statement listing only Brighton Homes as the debtor’s name, there could be consequences.
:p What would be the consequences if KDM Electronics filed a financing statement that listed only Brighton Homes as the debtor’s name?
??x
If KDM Electronics filed a financing statement with an incomplete or incorrect debtor's name (listing only "Brighton Homes"), it may not adequately protect its interest. Creditors must ensure that the debtor's exact name is used in the financing statement to avoid issues such as non-perfection of their security interest if there are other creditors who have filed valid statements.
x??

#### Priority and Perfection: PMSI in Consumer Goods
Background context explaining the concept. Paul Barton purchased a 4-Runner financed through Bridgeport Auto, which could be considered a purchase-money security interest (PMSI) in consumer goods.
:p Which of these purchases would qualify as a PMSI in consumer goods?
??x
The 4-Runner purchased from Bridgeport Auto qualifies as a PMSI in consumer goods. A PMSI is perfected by the debtor's acquisition of collateral for the debt secured, and it has priority over non-PMSIs if the debtor defaults.
x??

---

#### Disposition of Repossessed Collateral: Right to Keep or Sell
Background context explaining the concept. If KDM Electronics repossesses the surround-sound system but decides to keep it rather than sell it, there are specific regulations under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC).
:p Suppose that after KDM Electronics repossesses the surround-sound system, it decides to keep the system rather than sell it. Can KDM do this under Article 9? Why or why not?
??x
Under Article 9 of the UCC, if KDM Electronics repossesses the surround-sound system and decides to keep it rather than sell it, they can do so as long as the repossession was in compliance with the financing agreement and relevant law. However, keeping the collateral is typically a last resort; selling the item for fair market value and applying the proceeds toward Barton's debt is usually preferred.
x??

#### Financing Statement and Debtor Name Accuracy
Background context explaining the concept. The discussion of how accurate debtor names in financing statements affect creditor rights.
:p A financing statement that does not have the debtor’s exact name should still be effective because creditors should always be protected when debtors default. Terms and Concepts after-acquired property, attachment, authenticate, collateral, continuation statement, cross-collateralization, debtor, deficiency judgment, execution, financing statement, floating lien, junior lienholder, levy, perfection, proceeds, purchase-money security interest (PMSI), secured party, secured transaction, security agreement, security interest.
??x
A financing statement does not need to have the debtor's exact name to be effective. Creditors should always be protected when debtors default as long as they file a valid and properly authenticated financing statement that accurately identifies the collateral and any relevant parties involved in the transaction.

For example:
- If a creditor files a financing statement with an accurate description of the collateral and their interest, it should still be considered effective.
- However, if the debtor's name is incorrect or incomplete, other creditors who file valid statements could have priority over the original creditor.

#### Issue Spotter: Creating a Security Interest
Background context explaining the concept. Nero needs $500 to buy textbooks and other supplies. Olivia agrees to loan Nero$500, accepting Nero’s computer as collateral. They put their agreement in writing.
:p Nero needs $500 to buy textbooks and other supplies. Olivia agrees to loan Nero$500, accepting Nero’s computer as collateral. How can Olivia let other creditors know of her interest in the computer?
??x
Olivia should file a financing statement with the relevant state's office to perfect her security interest in the computer. This filing must include accurate information about the debtor (Nero) and the collateral (computer). By doing so, Olivia ensures that other creditors are aware of her interest, which is crucial for protecting her rights if Nero defaults on his loan.
x??

---

#### Issue Spotter: Bankruptcy and Repossession Alternatives
Background context explaining the concept. Liberty Bank loans Michelle $5,000 to buy a car, which is used as collateral to secure the loan. After repaying less than 50 percent of the loan, Michelle defaults.
:p Liberty Bank loans Michelle $5,000 to buy a car, which is used as collateral to secure the loan. After repaying less than 50 percent of the loan, Michelle defaults. What are the alternatives if Liberty decides not to keep the car but wants to recover its value?
??x
If Liberty Bank does not want to keep the car and instead seeks to recover the value of the collateral, it can sell the repossessed vehicle for fair market value and apply the proceeds toward Michelle's remaining debt. This process ensures that the bank maximizes recovery while adhering to Article 9 of the UCC, which governs secured transactions.

#### Recent Reforms

Background context explaining the concept. The 2005 Bankruptcy Reform Act was enacted to address concerns that too many debtors were avoiding paying their debts, shifting the balance between debtor and creditor rights.

:p What was one of the main goals of the 2005 Bankruptcy Reform Act?
??x
One of the main goals of the 2005 Bankruptcy Reform Act was to require more consumers to pay as many of their debts as possible instead of having those debts fully extinguished in bankruptcy.
x??

---

#### Real-World Examples

Background context explaining the concept. Many businesses and retail chains have filed for bankruptcy due to financial difficulties, such as increased online shopping competition.

:p Why might a retail chain like Radio Shack file for bankruptcy?
??x
Radio Shack could file for bankruptcy due to financial difficulties caused by increased online shopping competition.
x??

---
#### Monthly Income Statement
Background context explaining the requirement for a statement of monthly income, including itemization and verification through oath.
:p What must be included in the statement of monthly income?
??x
The debtor must provide an accurate itemized statement of their monthly income. This should detail how the amount is calculated, showing all sources of income such as salaries, wages, self-employment income, and any other regular income streams.
```java
public class IncomeStatement {
    public double calculateTotalIncome(List<Double> incomes) {
        return incomes.stream().mapToDouble(Double::doubleValue).sum();
    }
}
```
x??
---

#### Federal Income Tax Return for Debtor
Background context explaining the necessity of providing a federal income tax return, including the timeframe and consequences of non-compliance.
:p What must be included in the schedule regarding tax returns?
??x
The debtor is required to provide a copy of their most recent federal income tax return, which ends immediately before filing the petition. Failure to file these required schedules within forty-five days after the petition will result in an automatic dismissal unless an extension is granted.
```java
public class TaxReturnSubmission {
    public void submitTaxReturns(String filePath) {
        // Code for submitting tax returns
    }
}
```
x??
---

#### Bankruptcy Schedules Filing Deadline
Background context explaining the deadline for filing required schedules and exceptions for extensions.
:p What are the consequences of missing the 45-day deadline for filing bankruptcy schedules?
??x
If the debtor fails to file the required schedules within forty-five days after the petition is filed, the case will be automatically dismissed. However, an extension may be granted under certain circumstances.
```java
public class ScheduleFiling {
    public void checkForDeadline(String fileName) throws DeadlineMissedException {
        // Code for checking and handling deadline missed exception
    }
}
```
x??
---

#### Tax Returns during Bankruptcy Process
Background context explaining the requirement to file tax returns during bankruptcy proceedings.
:p Under what circumstances might a debtor be required to file additional tax returns?
??x
During the bankruptcy process, especially in Chapter 7, 11, and 13 cases, debtors may need to file tax returns at the end of each tax year. These filings are often requested by the court or U.S. trustee, but any party with a valid interest can also make this request.
```java
public class AdditionalTaxReturns {
    public void submitAnnualTaxReturn() {
        // Code for submitting annual tax return as required during bankruptcy proceedings
    }
}
```
x??
---

#### Substantial Abuse—Means Test
Background context explaining the criteria and purpose of the means test, including the basic formula.
:p What is the "means test" in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and why is it used?
??x
The means test is a legal requirement for determining whether a debtor filing under Chapter 7 has abused the bankruptcy process. It compares the debtor's average monthly income with the median income of their geographic area to determine eligibility. If the debtor’s income is below the median, they are typically allowed to file for Chapter 7. If above, further calculations are needed.
```java
public class MeansTest {
    public boolean qualifyForChapter7(double avgMonthlyIncome, double medianIncome) {
        return avgMonthlyIncome <= medianIncome;
    }
}
```

#### Involuntary Bankruptcy Overview
Involuntary bankruptcy is a legal process initiated by creditors to force a debtor into bankruptcy proceedings. This type of bankruptcy cannot be filed against charitable institutions or farmers (individuals or businesses that receive more than 50 percent of their gross income from farming operations). The Code penalizes frivolous petitions and provides for penalties if the petition is dismissed.
:p What are the key characteristics of an involuntary bankruptcy?
??x
Involuntary bankruptcies involve creditors forcing a debtor into bankruptcy. They cannot be filed against charitable institutions or farmers who make more than 50% of their income from farming. The Code imposes penalties on frivolous petitions and allows for damages if the petition is dismissed in bad faith.
x??

---
#### Filing Requirements for Involuntary Bankruptcy
For an involuntary bankruptcy to be filed, specific requirements must be met:
1. If a debtor has twelve or more creditors, three or more of these creditors with unsecured claims totaling at least $16,750 must join in the petition.
2. If a debtor has fewer than twelve creditors, one or more creditors with a claim totaling $16,750 or more may file.
3. The court cannot dismiss an involuntary bankruptcy if it is necessary to satisfy a domestic-support obligation.
4. These requirements are subject to adjustments every three years on April 1.
:p What are the conditions under which creditors can file for an involuntary bankruptcy?
??x
Creditors can file for an involuntary bankruptcy if:
- If there are twelve or more creditors, at least three must join with unsecured claims of $16,750 or more.
- For fewer than twelve creditors, a single creditor's claim of $16,750 or more is sufficient.
- Bankruptcy cannot be dismissed for domestic-support obligations.
x??

---
#### Order for Relief in Involuntary Bankruptcy
If the debtor challenges an involuntary petition, a hearing will be held. The court enters an order for relief if:
1. The debtor is not paying debts as they come due.
2. A general receiver, assignee, or custodian has taken possession of, or been appointed to take charge of, substantially all of the debtor's property within 120 days before the filing of the petition.
If an order for relief is granted, the debtor must provide information in bankruptcy schedules similar to those in a voluntary bankruptcy.
:p What does the court consider when deciding whether to grant an order for relief in an involuntary bankruptcy?
??x
The court grants an order for relief if:
- The debtor is not paying debts as they come due.
- A general receiver, assignee, or custodian has taken possession of, or been appointed to take charge of, substantially all of the debtor's property within 120 days before the petition filing.
x??

---
#### Automatic Stay in Bankruptcy
As soon as a bankruptcy petition is filed (either voluntarily or involuntarily), an automatic stay suspends all actions by creditors against the debtor or their property. This stay prohibits creditors from collecting, assessing, or recovering claims that arose before the petition's filing date. The stay continues until the bankruptcy proceeding is closed or dismissed.
:p What does the automatic stay in bankruptcy do?
??x
The automatic stay stops creditors from taking any action to collect, assess, or recover a claim against the debtor for actions that occurred prior to the petition's filing. This stays typically continue until the bankruptcy process is concluded or dismissed.
x??

---
#### Penalties and Damages for Violating the Automatic Stay
If a creditor violates the automatic stay knowingly (a willful violation), the injured party, including the debtor, can recover actual damages, costs, and attorneys' fees. Punitive damages may also be awarded.
:p What happens if a creditor violates the automatic stay?
??x
A creditor who violates the automatic stay intentionally can face legal consequences that include recovery of actual damages, costs, and attorney's fees for the injured party, including the debtor. In some cases, punitive damages might also be awarded.
x??

---

---
#### Bad Faith Petition
Background context: The Bankruptcy Code presumes that a debtor has filed a bankruptcy petition in bad faith if they had two or more petitions dismissed during the prior year. In such cases, the automatic stay does not go into effect until the court determines the petition was filed in good faith.
The automatic stay on secured debts terminates 30 days after filing if another bankruptcy petition was dismissed within the past year. Any party in interest can request an extension of the stay by showing it was filed in good faith.

:p What happens to the automatic stay when a debtor has had two or more bankruptcy petitions dismissed during the prior year?
??x
When a debtor has had two or more bankruptcy petitions dismissed during the prior year, the Bankruptcy Code presumes that the current petition is filed in bad faith. As a result:
- The automatic stay does not automatically go into effect; it must be determined by the court if the petition was filed in good faith.
- For secured debts, the automatic stay terminates 30 days after the petition is filed if the debtor has had a bankruptcy petition dismissed within the prior year.

This process allows the court to evaluate whether the current filing is indeed in good faith and not an abuse of the system. Parties interested can request an extension of the stay by demonstrating that the filing is in good faith.
x??

#### Estate in Bankruptcy
Background context: Upon the commencement of a liquidation proceeding under Chapter 7, an estate in bankruptcy (or estate in property) is created, consisting of all the debtor’s interests in property currently held, wherever located. The estate includes various types of properties such as community property, property transferred in voidable transactions, and proceeds from the estate.

:p What constitutes an estate in bankruptcy?
??x
An estate in bankruptcy consists of all the debtor's interests in property currently held, wherever located. This includes:
1. Community property (property jointly owned by married persons in certain states).
2. Property that was transferred in a transaction voidable by the trustee.
3. Proceeds and profits from the property of the estate.

Additionally, after-acquired property to which the debtor becomes entitled within 180 days after filing may also become part of the estate. This includes gifts, inheritances, property settlements (from divorce), and life insurance death proceeds. However, generally speaking, the filing of a bankruptcy petition fixes a dividing line:
- Property acquired prior to the filing of the petition becomes property of the estate.
- Property acquired after the filing of the petition remains with the debtor, except as noted above.

This process ensures that all relevant properties are included in the bankruptcy proceedings and helps in the equitable distribution among creditors and the debtor.
x??

---
#### The Bankruptcy Trustee
Background context: Promptly after the order for relief is entered in a liquidation proceeding under Chapter 7, a trustee is appointed. The trustee's primary duty is to collect the debtor’s available estate and reduce it to cash for distribution while preserving the interests of both the debtor and unsecured creditors.

:p What are the basic duties of the bankruptcy trustee?
??x
The basic duties of the bankruptcy trustee include:
1. Collecting the debtor’s available estate.
2. Reducing the collected property to cash for distribution.
3. Preserving the interests of both the debtor and unsecured creditors.

To enable the trustee to perform these duties, the Bankruptcy Code grants the trustee certain powers, which must be exercised within two years from the order for relief.

Additionally, the trustee is required to promptly review all materials filed by the debtor to determine if there is substantial abuse. Within ten days after the first meeting of creditors, the trustee must file a statement indicating whether the case is presumed to be an abuse under the means test and provide this statement to all creditors within five days.
x??

---
#### Review for Substantial Abuse
Background context: The Bankruptcy Trustee is required to promptly review all materials filed by the debtor to determine if there is substantial abuse. If a presumption of abuse arises, the trustee must either file a motion to dismiss the petition or convert it to a Chapter 13 petition. In cases involving domestic-support obligations (such as child support), the trustee must provide written notice to the claim holder.

:p What actions must the bankruptcy trustee take when reviewing materials filed by the debtor?
??x
When reviewing materials filed by the debtor, the bankruptcy trustee must:
1. Promptly evaluate whether there is substantial abuse.
2. Within ten days after the first meeting of creditors, file a statement indicating if the case is presumed to be an abuse under the means test.
3. Provide this statement to all creditors within five days.
4. If the presumption of abuse arises, the trustee must either:
   - File a motion to dismiss the petition (or convert it to a Chapter 13 petition).
   - Or file a statement explaining why a motion would not be appropriate.

In cases where the debtor owes a domestic-support obligation, such as child support, the trustee must provide written notice of the bankruptcy filing to the claim holder.
x??

---

---
#### Proof of Claim
Proof of claim is necessary when there is any dispute concerning a creditor's claim against the debtor. The proof lists the creditor’s name, address, and the amount owed by the debtor. In no-asset cases, unsecured creditors typically receive nothing or only a small portion of their claims.
:p What is a proof of claim used for?
??x
A proof of claim is used to formally establish the amount a creditor believes they are owed from the debtor in a bankruptcy case. It serves as an official record and can be challenged if there's any dispute over the debt.
x??

---
#### No-Asset Case
In no-asset cases, creditors are notified but instructed not to file claims. The unsecured creditors will likely receive no payment, and most or all of their debts will be discharged. Secured creditors have priority in this case since they can claim the collateral if the debtor defaults.
:p What happens in a no-asset bankruptcy case?
??x
In a no-asset bankruptcy case, unsecured creditors do not file claims as there are no assets available for distribution. The unsecured debts are typically discharged, meaning the debtor is relieved of the obligation to repay them. Secured creditors retain their right to reclaim collateral if the debtor defaults.
x??

---
#### Distribution of Property
The Bankruptcy Code provides specific rules on how property is distributed among secured and unsecured creditors. If any amount remains after priority classes have been satisfied, it goes to the debtor. Secured creditors get preference over unsecured parties in this process.
:p How is property distributed among creditors?
??x
Property distribution follows a hierarchical order under the Bankruptcy Code: first, secured creditors are paid according to their claims using collateral; second, administrative expenses (like legal fees) are covered next; third, priority debts such as taxes; and lastly, unsecured creditors receive any remaining funds. Any surplus is given back to the debtor.
x??

---
#### Statement of Intention for Secured Collateral
Consumer debtors must file a statement of intention with respect to secured collateral in bankruptcy proceedings. They can choose options like paying off the debt, reclaiming it as exempt property, reaffirming the debt, or surrendering the property.
:p What does a consumer debtor need to do regarding secured collateral?
??x
A consumer debtor must submit a statement of intention regarding their secured collateral. The choices are: (1) Pay off the debt and redeem the collateral; (2) Claim the collateral as exempt property; (3) Reaffirm the debt and continue making payments; or (4) Surrender the property to the secured party. Each choice affects how the collateral is treated in bankruptcy.
x??

---
#### Priority of Secured Creditors
Secured creditors have priority over unsecured parties when it comes to proceeds from the disposition of collateral. If the sale of collateral is insufficient to cover the secured debt, the debtor becomes an unsecured creditor for the remaining amount (deficiency).
:p How are secured and unsecured creditors treated during property distribution?
??x
Secured creditors take precedence in receiving payments from the proceeds of collateral sales. Any surplus after fully satisfying the secured claims goes to unsecured creditors. If the sale price is less than the debt, the debtor may still be liable for the remaining amount as an unsecured creditor.
x??

---
#### Administrative Expenses and Unsecured Claims
In Chapter 7 liquidations, certain unsecured creditors can sometimes step into the shoes of secured tax creditors if their claims are converted from a Chapter 11 case. However, this does not apply to holders of unsecured claims for administrative expenses in Chapter 11 cases that convert to Chapter 7.
:p What is an exception to the distribution rules?
??x
In some cases, unsecured creditors can be treated as if they were secured tax creditors during a Chapter 7 liquidation. This means their claims are paid before other unsecured debts when the collateral securing the tax claims is sold. However, this does not apply to administrative expenses incurred in converted Chapter 11 cases.
x??

---
#### Case Study: Henry Anderson
Henry Anderson filed for voluntary bankruptcy under Chapter 11 and later his case was converted to a Chapter 7 liquidation. The IRS had a large claim secured by property. Stubbs & Perdue, P.A., was hired as counsel with $200k in fees. These fees constituted an unsecured claim against the estate.
:p What happened in Henry Anderson's bankruptcy case?
??x
Henry Anderson filed for voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy and later had his case converted to a Chapter 7 liquidation. The IRS claimed over $987,000 secured by property. Legal fees of $200k were incurred and constituted an unsecured claim against the estate. The trustee distributed $702,630.25, excluding Stubbs's administrative fee claim.
x??

#### Reaffirmation of Debt
Background context: A debtor may wish to pay a debt that could be discharged in bankruptcy, such as debts owed to family members, physicians, banks, or other creditors. Additionally, a debtor cannot retain secured property while continuing to pay without entering into a reaffirmation agreement.

Procedures:
- Reaffirmation agreements must be made before the debtor is granted a discharge.
- The agreement must be signed and filed with the court.
- Court approval is required unless the debtor is represented by an attorney during negotiation and submits proper documents and certifications. 
- Even when the debtor is represented, court approval may be necessary if it appears that the reaffirmation will result in undue hardship to the debtor.

C/Java code or pseudocode:
```pseudocode
procedure ReaffirmDebt(debtor, creditor)
    if debtor.wantsToPay and (creditor.canBeDischarged) then
        signReaffirmationAgreement()
        fileWithCourt()
        if debtor.isRepresentedByAttorney then
            approveAgreementWithoutHardship()
        else
            courtApprovalRequired()
        end if
    end if
end procedure
```

:p What are the steps required for a reaffirmation agreement to be enforceable?
??x
The steps required for a reaffirmation agreement to be enforceable include making it before discharge, signing and filing with the court, obtaining court approval unless represented by an attorney, and ensuring the agreement does not cause undue hardship.

Explanation:
1. **Timing:** The agreement must be made before the debtor is granted a discharge.
2. **Documentation:** It needs to be signed and filed with the court.
3. **Court Approval:** Generally required; however, if the debtor is represented by an attorney, it may still need approval unless the reaffirmation would cause undue hardship.

```pseudocode
if debtor.isRepresentedByAttorney then
    submitDocumentsToCourt()
else
    courtHearingRequired()
end if
```

x??

---

#### Required Disclosures for Reaffirmations
Background context: The law provides specific language to be disclosed to debtors entering into reaffirmation agreements. These disclosures explain that the debtor is not required to reaffirm any debt, and that liens on secured property will remain in effect even if the debt is not reaffirmed.

Required Disclosures:
- Amount of debt reaffirmed
- Interest rate
- Date payments begin
- Right to rescind

C/Java code or pseudocode:
```pseudocode
procedure RequiredDisclosures(debtor, creditor)
    debtor.mustBeInformedThatTheyAreNotObligedToReaffirm()
    creditor.provideDetailsAboutAmountAndInterestRate()
    debtor.beToldPaymentsWillBeginOnSpecifiedDate()
    debtor.haveRightToRescindTheAgreement()
end procedure
```

:p What information must be disclosed to the debtor before they enter into a reaffirmation agreement?
??x
The required disclosures include informing the debtor that they are not obligated to reaffirm any debt, providing details about the amount and interest rate of the debt, specifying when payments will begin, and ensuring the debtor has the right to rescind the agreement.

Explanation:
1. **Debt Obligation:** Debtors should be informed that reaffirming a debt is optional.
2. **Financial Details:** The specific amount and interest rate of the debt must be disclosed.
3. **Payment Schedule:** When payments will commence needs to be clearly communicated.
4. **Right to Rescind:** Debtors should have the right to cancel the agreement.

```pseudocode
procedure ProvideDetails()
    print("You are not required to reaffirm this debt.")
    print("The amount of the debt is $X, with an interest rate of Y%.")
    print("Payments will begin on [Date].")
    print("You have the right to rescind this agreement at any time.")
end procedure
```

#### Case in Point 31.8: Reaffirmation Agreement Violation
Background context: Howard Lapides, owner of a seafood import business, signed a secured promissory note for $400,000 with Venture Bank for a revolving line-of-credit loan. After filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and having their personal debts discharged, Venture Bank convinced the Lapideses to sign a reaffirmation agreement.

Case details:
- The bank promised to refinance all three mortgages so they could keep their house.
- Lapideses made twelve $3,500 payments but stopped when the bank did not fulfill its promise.
- A court refused to enforce the reaffirmation agreement because it was not signed by the debtor's attorney or filed with the bankruptcy court.

C/Java code or pseudocode:
```pseudocode
procedure HandleReaffirmationViolation()
    if LapidesesSignedAgreement and AgreementNotFulfilled then
        LapidesesStoppedPayments()
        bankFiledSuit()
        if AgreementNotSignedByAttorneyOrNotFiledWithCourt then
            courtRefusedToEnforce()
        end if
    end if
end procedure
```

:p What happened in Case in Point 31.8 regarding the reaffirmation agreement?
??x
In Case in Point 31.8, Howard Lapides signed a reaffirmation agreement with Venture Bank to keep their house after discharging personal debts through bankruptcy. However, when the bank did not fulfill its promise to refinance all three mortgages, Lapideses stopped making payments. Despite having made twelve $3,500 payments, the court refused to enforce the reaffirmation agreement because it was neither signed by the debtor's attorney nor filed with the bankruptcy court.

Explanation:
1. **Agreement and Bank’s Promises:** The Lapideses agreed to reaffirm a significant debt to keep their home, under the condition that Venture Bank would refinance all three mortgages.
2. **Failure to Fulfill Promise:** When the bank did not follow through on its promise, the Lapideses stopped making payments.
3. **Legal Consequences:** Despite the initial payments, the court did not enforce the reaffirmation agreement because it lacked proper documentation and filings.

```pseudocode
if !AgreementSignedByAttorney or !FilingWithCourt then
    print("Reaffirmation Agreement Not Enforced.")
end if
```

#### Reorganizations for Corporate Debtors
Background context: The most commonly used bankruptcy proceeding by corporate debtors is the Chapter 11 reorganization. In a reorganization, the creditors and the debtor formulate a plan under which the debtor pays a portion of the debts and is discharged of the remainder. The debtor continues to operate its business.

C/Java code or pseudocode:
```pseudocode
procedure CorporateReorganization(debtor)
    if debtor.isCorporate then
        fileForChapter11()
        creditorsAndDebtorFormulatePlan()
        debtorPaysPortionOfDebt()
        remainderDischarged()
        debtorContinuesOperation()
    end if
end procedure
```

:p What is the process for corporate debtors to reorganize their debts?
??x
The process for corporate debtors under Chapter 11 reorganization involves several steps:
1. **Filing for Chapter 11:** The corporation files for bankruptcy.
2. **Formulate a Plan:** Creditors and the debtor work together to create a plan.
3. **Debtor Pays Portion of Debt:** The debtor pays a portion of its debts according to the plan.
4. **Discharge Remaining Debt:** Any remaining debt is discharged, allowing the corporation to continue operations.

Explanation:
1. **Filing for Chapter 11:** Corporate debtors file under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code to initiate the reorganization process.
2. **Plan Formulation:** Creditors and the debtor collaborate to develop a plan that outlines how debts will be repaid, potentially through restructuring or liquidation.
3. **Debt Repayment:** The corporation makes payments as specified in the plan.
4. **Debt Discharge:** Once all agreed-upon terms are met, any remaining debt is discharged, allowing the corporation to continue its operations.

```pseudocode
if debtor.isCorporate then
