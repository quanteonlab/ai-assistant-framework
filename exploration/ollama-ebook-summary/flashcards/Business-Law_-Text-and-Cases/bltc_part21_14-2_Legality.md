**Starting Chapter:** 14-2 Legality

---

#### Legality of Contracts
Contracts must be formed for a legal purpose to be valid and enforceable. Federal or state statutory laws prohibit certain contracts, making them illegal and unenforceable. Additionally, agreements to commit tortious acts are contrary to public policy.
:p What makes a contract invalid due to illegality?
??x
A contract that violates federal or state laws is void from the outset and thus unenforceable. Contracts involving criminal activities like drug trafficking or hiding corporate violations of securities laws or environmental regulations are also illegal.
x??

---

#### Contracts Contrary to Statute
Statutes often dictate what can and cannot be included in contracts. We examine cases where a contract may be contrary to statute, making it illegal. Examples include agreements to commit crimes, usury, and gambling.
:p How do statutes affect the legality of certain types of contracts?
??x
Statutes set rules for including terms in contracts and prohibit specific actions. For instance, usury laws limit interest rates that can be charged, while gambling laws restrict certain types of wagering activities.
x??

---

#### Contracts to Commit a Crime
Any contract involving criminal activity is illegal and unenforceable. Examples include selling illegal drugs or hiding corporate violations under the law.
:p What makes a contract related to crime invalid?
??x
A contract that includes any agreement to commit a crime, such as selling illegal drugs or concealing corporate violations of securities laws or environmental regulations, is illegal and unenforceable because it violates criminal statutes.
x??

---

#### Contracts Rendered Illegal by Statute
Sometimes the legality of a contract depends on ongoing compliance with statutory requirements. If these are violated after the contract is formed, the contract may be discharged (terminated) by law.
:p What happens when a statute renders an existing contract illegal?
??x
If a statute changes and makes the performance or purpose of an existing contract illegal, the contract may be terminated by operation of law. For example, if new environmental regulations make the performance of a construction contract impossible, it could be discharged.
x??

---

#### Usury
Usury refers to charging interest above the legal maximum rate allowed by state statutes. While usurious contracts are illegal, states often limit the interest that can be collected rather than invalidating the entire agreement.
:p What is usury and how do states handle such cases?
??x
Usury involves lending money at an interest rate higher than the legally permitted maximum. Most states limit the amount of interest a lender can collect to the lawful maximum, while in some states, lenders may only recover the principal without any interest.
x??

---

#### Gambling Contracts
Gambling is defined as creating risk for the purpose of assuming it. Traditional state laws deemed gambling contracts illegal but many now allow certain forms of legal gambling like horse racing and charity-sponsored bingo. State-operated lotteries are also common.
:p How are gambling contracts typically treated by law?
??x
Traditionally, states considered all gambling contracts illegal. However, today, many states permit specific types of gambling under regulated circumstances, such as state-run lotteries or casino operations like video poker and charity-sponsored bingo.
x??

---

#### Contracts by Mentally Incompetent Persons
If a court declares a person to be mentally incompetent and appoints a legal guardian, any contract made by that individual is void from the outset. If the person lacks capacity but can understand the agreement when formed, it is voidable at their discretion.
:p What happens if someone enters into a contract while mentally incompetent?
??x
If a court has declared a person to be mentally incompetent and appointed a legal guardian, any contract they enter into is void from the outset. If no such declaration exists but the person lacked capacity when entering the agreement, it can be voidable at their option.

---
#### Procedural Unconscionability
Background context: Procedural unconscionability refers to a situation where there is a lack of meaningful choice for one party, often due to an imbalance in bargaining power. This can be assessed by considering factors such as conspicuousness of the print, intelligibility of language, opportunity to ask questions about the contract, and disparity of bargaining power.
:p What does procedural unconscionability assess in a contract?
??x
Procedural unconscionability evaluates whether there was a meaningful choice for one party in the formation of the contract. This assessment considers factors such as conspicuousness of print (whether terms are clearly noticeable), intelligibility of language (whether terms can be understood), opportunity to ask questions (whether the other party was given an opportunity to inquire about the terms), and disparity of bargaining power (whether there is a significant imbalance in negotiating power).
x??

---
#### Substantive Unconscionability
Background context: Substantive unconscionability involves evaluating whether a contract or its provisions are oppressive or overly harsh. It focuses on whether a provision deprives one party of the benefits of the agreement or leaves that party without a remedy for non-performance by the other party.
:p What does substantive unconscionability assess in a contract?
??x
Substantive unconscionability examines whether the terms of a contract are oppressive or overly harsh. It looks at whether any provision in the contract deprives one party of the benefits it was supposed to receive under the agreement, or if that party is left without any remedy for non-performance by the other party.
x??

---
#### Exculpatory Clauses
Background context: Exculpatory clauses are provisions in contracts that release a party from liability in case of monetary or physical injury. Courts often refuse to enforce these clauses due to their unconscionability and violation of public policy, particularly in contexts like rental agreements for commercial property, residential leases, and employment contracts.
:p What is an exculpatory clause?
??x
An exculpatory clause is a provision in a contract that releases one party from liability in the event of monetary or physical injury, regardless of fault. These clauses are often seen as unconscionable by courts due to their potential unfairness and violation of public policy.
x??

---
#### Arbitration Agreement
Background context: The case involving Tiffany Brinkley highlights an arbitration agreement within a retail installment contract. When disputes arise, the agreement mandates that parties resolve their differences through arbitration rather than litigation. The enforceability of such agreements can depend on factors like procedural unconscionability and public policy considerations.
:p What is an arbitration agreement?
??x
An arbitration agreement is a clause in a contract that stipulates that any disputes between the parties will be resolved through arbitration, rather than through traditional court proceedings. This agreement typically includes provisions for selecting arbitrators and setting up procedures for dispute resolution.
x??

---
#### Unconscionable Contract or Clause
Background context: An unconscionable contract or clause is one that is void because it violates public policy due to the lack of knowledge or understanding by one party. This can occur when a party enters into a contract without adequate information or understanding, making the agreement unfair.
:p What makes a contract or clause unconscionable?
??x
A contract or clause is considered unconscionable if it is void for reasons of public policy, typically due to the lack of knowledge or understanding by one party. This occurs when the contract was entered into, or a term became part of it, because of insufficient information or comprehension of the agreement or its terms.

#### Release Ambiguity and Interpretation
Background context explaining the concept. The passage discusses a legal dispute where plaintiffs argued that a release signed by them did not clearly specify those being released from liability, leading to a summary judgment in favor of defendants. The court's interpretation focuses on whether the language used in the release is ambiguous.

:p What does the court determine about the ambiguity of the release?
??x
The court determines that the release is not ambiguous because it uses all-inclusive language such as "any" and "all," which excludes no individuals or entities involved with the event. The specific inclusion of terms like "Event sponsors and their agents and employees, and all other persons or entities associated with this Event" clarifies that any entity related to the event is covered.

This determination comes from the understanding that when a release states it covers "any and all," it comprehensively includes everyone without leaving out potential claimants. The court emphasizes that such broad language is unambiguous in barring claims against third parties not party to the release, as long as they are reasonably foreseeable within the context of the event.

??x
The answer with detailed explanations.
```java
// Pseudocode Example for Understanding Release Language
public class ReleaseLanguageExample {
    public boolean isReleaseAmbiguous(String releaseText) {
        // Check if "any" and "all" are used in a broad, inclusive manner
        String[] keywords = {"any", "all"};
        for (String keyword : keywords) {
            if (releaseText.contains(keyword)) {
                return false; // Not ambiguous as it uses all-inclusive language
            }
        }
        return true; // Ambiguous if no such inclusive words are found
    }
}
```

#### Specificity in Prospective Releases
Background context explaining the concept. The passage also touches on whether specificity is required in a prospective release, which would cover future acts of negligence. Plaintiffs argue that more specificity should be necessary for prospective releases compared to retrospective ones.

:p Do courts require more specificity in prospective releases?
??x
Courts generally do not require more specificity in prospective releases than in retrospective ones. The passage notes that the use of "any" and "all" is deemed unambiguous, even when applied prospectively. This means that a release covering "any Event sponsors" would be interpreted to include all event sponsors without needing specific names.

The court’s reasoning is based on the principle that such broad language comprehensively covers all potential claimants or defendants. However, in this case, the plaintiffs argue for additional specificity due to the prospective nature of their claims, suggesting that more explicit naming might be necessary when dealing with future events.

??x
The answer with detailed explanations.
```java
// Pseudocode Example for Understanding Prospective Release Specificity
public class ProspectiveReleaseSpecificity {
    public boolean isProspectiveReleaseSpecific(String releaseText) {
        // Check if "any" and "all" are used in a broad, inclusive manner
        String[] keywords = {"any", "all"};
        for (String keyword : keywords) {
            if (releaseText.contains(keyword)) {
                return true; // Not requiring additional specificity
            }
        }
        return false; // May require more specific language for clarity
    }
}
```
x??

#### Application of Release Language
Background context explaining the concept. The court's ruling focuses on whether the language used in a release is clear and unambiguous, specifically regarding who it covers. In this case, the release covered "any Event sponsors" and other related entities.

:p How does the court determine the coverage of a release?
??x
The court determines the coverage of the release by evaluating the language used. Specifically, it finds that the release's use of "any and all persons" is unambiguous and comprehensive enough to cover all relevant parties without requiring specific names or additional details.

This determination is based on the principle that broad language like "any Event sponsors" includes every possible sponsor associated with the event, whether known or unknown at the time. The court holds that such inclusive language applies to future acts of negligence as well, making it unnecessary to name each potential defendant.

??x
The answer with detailed explanations.
```java
// Pseudocode Example for Determining Release Coverage
public class ReleaseCoverage {
    public boolean isReleaseCovered(String releaseText) {
        // Check if "any" and "all" are used in a broad, inclusive manner
        String[] keywords = {"any", "all"};
        for (String keyword : keywords) {
            if (releaseText.contains(keyword)) {
                return true; // Covered as it uses all-inclusive language
            }
        }
        return false; // Not covered unless more specific terms are used
    }
}
```

#### Joan's Lease Agreement

Background context: Joan, a 16-year-old, signs a one-year lease for an apartment at Kenwood Apartments and later moves back to her parents' home due to inability to pay rent. Her parents inform her that she can return to live with them.

:p Can Kenwood enforce the lease against Joan?
??x
Kenwood can likely enforce the lease against Joan because contracts entered into by minors are generally voidable, but not necessarily unenforceable. In many jurisdictions, a minor who enters into a contract can choose to ratify it or disaffirm it (cancel it). However, once the minor takes actions that indicate they intend to be bound by the contract (like paying rent), the contract becomes enforceable against them.

In this case, Joan's act of signing the lease and moving out suggests she intended to be bound. Therefore, Kenwood can enforce the lease unless Joan explicitly disaffirms it within a reasonable time after reaching the age of majority or taking other actions that indicate her intent not to be bound by the contract.

```java
// Pseudocode for checking contractual capacity
public boolean canEnforceLease(int age, boolean hasPaidRent) {
    if (age < 18) { // Assuming 18 is the legal age of majority
        return hasPaidRent && !disaffirmed;
    } else {
        return true; // Adults are generally bound by their contracts
    }
}
```

#### Sun Airlines' Liability Clause

Background context: Sun Airlines includes a clause in its tickets stating it is not liable for injuries caused by the airline's negligence. The question revolves around whether this clause can be used as a defense if the cause of an accident is found to be the airline’s negligence.

:p Can Sun Airlines use the clause as a defense to liability?
??x
No, Sun Airlines cannot use the clause as a defense to liability because such clauses are generally considered void under public policy. Public policy typically holds that carriers have a duty of care towards their passengers and that any contractual provisions attempting to limit or disclaim this duty are unenforceable.

The rationale is based on the principle that contracts should not be used to override fundamental legal duties owed by one party to another, especially where it involves safety concerns. In jurisdictions with consumer protection laws, such clauses may be deemed void as against public policy.

```java
// Pseudocode for checking legality of liability clause
public boolean canUseClause() {
    return false; // Such clauses are generally unenforceable under public policy
}
```
x??

#### Covenants Not to Compete

Background context: Hotel Lux contracts with Chef Perlee not to work as a chef in any hotel or restaurant in New York, New Jersey, or Pennsylvania for one year after leaving the employment of Hotel Lux. The question revolves around whether Hotel Lux can enjoin Perlee from working at a nearby restaurant.

:p How successful will Hotel Lux be in its action?
??x
Hotel Lux is likely to succeed in its action because covenants not to compete are generally enforceable, provided they meet certain legal requirements such as being reasonable in scope and time. The covenant should cover a legitimate business interest (presumably protecting the hotel's market share), be limited in duration (one year seems reasonable), and not be overly broad.

In this case, Hotel Lux heavily advertised Perlee to attract customers, so it has a strong interest in preventing him from working at a nearby restaurant that could potentially siphon off its business. The court would likely find the covenant enforceable based on these factors.

```java
// Pseudocode for checking reasonableness of non-compete clause
public boolean isCovenantEnforceable(String region, int duration) {
    if (region.equals("New York or New Jersey or Pennsylvania") && duration <= 12) {
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}
```

#### Intoxication and Contractual Capacity

Background context: Kira, who was intoxicated at the time of making a contract to sell a diamond necklace for $100, is now trying to void the contract. The question revolves around whether Kira can successfully claim that the contract is voidable due to her intoxication.

:p Was Kira correct in claiming the contract was voidable?
??x
Yes, Kira can successfully claim that the contract is voidable because intoxication can render a person incapable of entering into a valid contract. In most jurisdictions, a person who enters into a contract while intoxicated may be able to void the contract if they can show that their intoxication significantly impaired their judgment and capacity to understand the nature and consequences of the agreement.

To succeed, Kira must demonstrate that she was so intoxicated that her ability to make a rational decision regarding the sale was substantially impaired. If she can establish this fact, the court may find that the contract is voidable at her option.

```java
// Pseudocode for checking intoxication and contract validity
public boolean canVoidContract(String reasonForIntoxication) {
    if (reasonForIntoxication.equals("drinking") && !wasMentalStateNormal) {
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}
```

#### Mental Incompetence

Background context: Dorothy Drury, suffering from dementia and chronic confusion, signed a residency agreement for an assisted living facility that included an arbitration clause. After sustaining injuries in a fall at the facility, her son Eddie sought to compel arbitration based on the agreement. The question revolves around whether Dorothy is bound by the residency agreement.

:p Was Dorothy bound to the residency agreement?
??x
Dorothy was likely not bound to the residency agreement due to her mental incompetence. Contracts require parties to have the legal capacity to enter into an agreement, and this generally includes the ability to understand the nature and consequences of the contract.

Given that Dorothy suffered from dementia and chronic confusion, it is highly probable that she lacked the mental competence to fully comprehend the terms of the residency agreement and arbitration clause. Therefore, any action taken while under such conditions would likely be voidable or unenforceable.

The court may consider whether there was proper representation and understanding of the contract terms at the time Dorothy signed, but given her condition, it is unlikely that she had the mental capacity to make an informed decision.

```java
// Pseudocode for checking mental competence for contracts
public boolean hasMentalCompetence(String condition) {
    if (condition.equals("dementia and chronic confusion")) {
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```

#### Release Agreement Legality (Desgro v. Pack, 2013 WL 84899)

Background context: Sue Ann Apolinar signed a release agreement with Arkansas Valley Adventures, LLC, before participating in a rafting excursion on the Arkansas River. The release detailed various hazards and risks associated with the trip, including overturning, unpredictable currents, obstacles, and drowning. It also stated that signing the release would discharge the company from liability for all claims arising from the trip.

:p What are the arguments for enforcing the release signed by Sue Ann Apolinar?
??x
The argument in favor of enforcing the release is based on the principle that the signatory has voluntarily assumed the risks associated with the activity. By signing the waiver, Sue Ann Apolinar agreed to relinquish any claims against the rafting company if an accident occurred during the trip. This is a common practice in outdoor adventure activities where inherent dangers are present.

On the other hand, opponents of enforcing the release argue that such agreements may not be enforceable under certain circumstances. For example, if the waiver contains overly broad language that shields the company from liability for gross negligence or willful misconduct, it might be deemed unenforceable. Additionally, some courts consider whether the waiver is fair and reasonable in light of the inherent risks involved.

```java
public class ReleaseAgreement {
    // Code to simulate the enforcement logic
    public boolean enforceRelease(String signerName, String waiverText) {
        if (signerName.equals("Sue Ann Apolinar")) { // Simplified check
            return true; // Enforce in this scenario for simplicity
        } else {
            return false; // Not enforcing as a default condition
        }
    }
}
```

#### Minors and Contractual Capacity (McWilliam v. McWilliam, 46 N.E.3d 598)

Background context: Mechelle, a minor described as emotionally troubled and under the influence of substances, signed a deed transferring her one-half interest in a house to her mother, Bonney. Mechelle later contested this transfer due to ongoing conflicts with her mother.

:p Could the transfer of Mechelle’s interest be disaffirmed?
??x
The transfer of Mechelle's interest could potentially be disaffirmed because minors generally lack the full contractual capacity required for validly executing deeds or other complex legal documents. The fact that Mechelle was described as emotionally troubled and under the influence of substances may further support her claim to disaffirm the deed.

Under Massachusetts law, a minor can disaffirm contracts made while they were minors if they acted without knowledge of their rights or due to lack of capacity. Since Mechelle signed the deed when she was 16 (still considered a minor), and considering her described state, there is a strong basis for disaffirming the transfer.

```java
public class MinorsLegalCapacity {
    // Code to simulate disaffirmation logic
    public boolean canDisaffirm(String signerName, int age) {
        if (signerName.equals("Mechelle") && age < 18) { // Simplified check
            return true; // Can disaffirm in this scenario for simplicity
        } else {
            return false; // Cannot disaffirm as a default condition
        }
    }
}
```

#### Contracts Contrary to Public Policy (P. M. v. T.B., 907 N.W.2d 522)

Background context: P.M. and C.M. contracted with T.B. for surrogacy services, agreeing to pay $13,000 plus medical expenses in exchange for carrying a child using P.M.’s sperm and an anonymous donor’s ovum. The agreement included terms that T.B. would hand over the baby at birth. However, relations between the parties deteriorated, leading to a dispute over the contract.

:p Is the surrogacy contract enforceable?
??x
The enforceability of the surrogacy contract hinges on whether it violates any public policy or legal restrictions in Iowa. Although Iowa exempts surrogacy from its criminal statute prohibiting selling babies, this does not necessarily make all aspects of the agreement enforceable.

To determine if the contract is enforceable, courts would consider various factors:
- Whether the terms are fair and reasonable.
- If there were any fraudulent or deceptive practices involved.
- The best interests of the child (if applicable).

Given that T.B. was excluded as a biological parent through genetic testing and refused to honor her agreement, combined with the deteriorating relationship between the parties, the contract may face significant challenges in enforcement.

```java
public class SurrogacyContract {
    // Code to simulate contract enforceability logic
    public boolean isEnforceable(String signerName, boolean biologicalParent) {
        if (signerName.equals("T.B.") && !biologicalParent) { // Simplified check
            return false; // Not enforceable in this scenario for simplicity
        } else {
            return true; // Enforceable as a default condition
        }
    }
}
```

#### Personal Injury and Minors (Sky High Sports Nashville Operations, LLC)

Background context: Jacob Blackwell, a minor participating in a dodgeball tournament at Sky High Sports Nashville Operations, LLC, suffered a torn tendon and a broken tibia during the event.

:p What are the potential legal issues related to this incident?
??x
The potential legal issues related to this incident include negligence claims by Jacob Blackwell against Sky High Sports. Given that Jacob is a minor, his legal guardian (likely his parents) would have to file the lawsuit on his behalf. Key factors in determining liability would be:

1. **Facility Safety Standards**: Did Sky High Sports provide adequate equipment and safety measures for the activity?
2. **Instructor Training**: Were the instructors adequately trained to handle potential emergencies?
3. **Parental Liability Waivers**: If parents signed waivers, did they understand their legal implications?

The court would consider whether Sky High Sports breached its duty of care towards participants, especially minors who may be more vulnerable.

```java
public class MinorsPersonalInjury {
    // Code to simulate negligence claims logic
    public boolean isNegligent(String facilityName) {
        if (facilityName.equals("Sky High Sports Nashville")) { // Simplified check
            return true; // Negligent in this scenario for simplicity
        } else {
            return false; // Not negligent as a default condition
        }
    }
}
```

#### Unilateral Mistakes of Fact
Background context: A unilateral mistake is made by only one party, usually resulting from a typographical error or miscalculation. This type of mistake does not automatically void the contract but may provide grounds for rescission if the other party knew or should have known about the mistake.
:p What happens when there is a unilateral mistake in a contract?
??x
A unilateral mistake does not generally give the mistaken party any right to relief from the contract, and the contract remains enforceable. However, if the other party was aware of the mistake, the contract might be avoided or rescinded.

The key point here is that the unaware party must have had knowledge or should have known about the mistake for it to affect the contract's validity.
x??

---
#### Unilateral Mistakes in Contract Example
Background context: The text provides an example where Elena intended to sell her jet ski for $2,500 but mistakenly typed $1,500. Although the other party (Chin) did not know about this mistake, it serves as a practical illustration.
:p What is the scenario described in the example of a unilateral mistake?
??x
Elena intends to sell her jet ski for $2,500 but accidentally types $1,500 in an email to Chin. Even though Chin accepted the offer based on this incorrect price, Elena intended to sell at a higher price.

In this case, even if there was no knowledge of the mistake by Chin, the contract is still enforceable as long as Chin had valid reasons to rely on the mistaken information.
x??

---
#### Exceptions to Unilateral Mistakes
Background context: The text outlines two exceptions to the general rule that a unilateral mistake does not void a contract. These include cases where the other party knew of or should have known about the mistake, and situations involving substantial mathematical mistakes made inadvertently without gross negligence.
:p How can a unilateral mistake still affect the enforceability of a contract?
??x
A unilateral mistake may affect the contract's enforceability if:
1. The other party was aware of or should have been aware of the mistake.
2. There was a significant and inadvertent error in calculation (e.g., mathematical mistakes).

These exceptions highlight that not all unilateral mistakes are equally impactful, depending on whether they were known to the other party or result from gross negligence.
x??

---
#### Bilateral Mistakes
Background context: A bilateral mistake involves both parties misunderstanding a basic assumption upon which the contract was formed. The text discusses how such mistakes can affect enforceability and provides two primary exceptions where contracts might be unenforceable due to mutual misperceptions.
:p What is a bilateral mistake in the context of contract law?
??x
A bilateral mistake occurs when both parties share an incorrect understanding of a fundamental fact that forms the basis of their agreement. This type of mistake can render a contract voidable if it involves a material fact and if either party was unaware of or should not have known about the mistake.
x??

---
#### Contract Non-Enforceability Due to Mistakes
Background context: The text explains that contracts may be unenforceable due to mistakes, but only unilateral and bilateral mistakes involving material facts can affect this. It also discusses how gross negligence plays a role in certain exceptions.
:p Under what circumstances might a contract be unenforceable based on a mistake?
??x
A contract is unenforceable based on a mistake if:
1. The other party was aware of or should have been aware of the unilateral mistake.
2. There was a substantial mathematical error made inadvertently without gross negligence.

For instance, if a contractor's bid significantly underestimates costs due to an arithmetic mistake and was made carelessly, they might be able to rescind the contract.
