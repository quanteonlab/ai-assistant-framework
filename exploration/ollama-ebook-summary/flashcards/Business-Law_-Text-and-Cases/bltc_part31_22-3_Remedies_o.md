#### Reasonable Period of Time for Rejecting Goods
Background context: Under UCC 2-602(1), if a buyer or lessee fails to reject goods within a reasonable period, they are deemed to have accepted the goods. The UCC also includes similar provisions under UCC 2-606(1)(b) and 2A-515(1)(b). Additionally, under UCC 2-606(1)(c), performing any act inconsistent with the seller's ownership (like using or reselling goods without testing or inspecting them first) is considered acceptance.
:p What does failing to reject goods within a reasonable period mean in terms of contract law?
??x
Failing to reject goods within a reasonable period means that if the buyer or lessee does not inform the seller or lessor within a reasonable time frame, they are deemed to have accepted the goods. This can lead to a situation where the buyer is held liable for payment even if there were issues with the delivered goods.

#### Partial Acceptance in Sales Contracts
Background context: If some of the goods delivered do not conform to the contract and the seller or lessor has failed to cure, the buyer or lessee can make a partial acceptance. This applies particularly when nonconformity is not reasonably discoverable before acceptance (UCC 2-601(c), 2A-509(1)). However, a buyer cannot accept less than a single commercial unit.
:p How does partial acceptance work in sales contracts?
??x
Partial acceptance works by allowing the buyer or lessee to take and use goods that conform while rejecting those that do not. If the nonconformity is not reasonably discoverable before acceptance, the buyer may still be able to revoke the acceptance later. However, they cannot accept less than a single commercial unit.

#### Anticipatory Repudiation
Background context: Anticipatory repudiation occurs when one party clearly communicates their intention not to perform their obligations under the contract before the performance is due (UCC 2-610, 2A-402). This can lead to immediate legal consequences for both parties.
:p What is anticipatory repudiation?
??x
Anticipatory repudiation occurs when one party clearly communicates their intention not to perform their obligations under the contract before the performance is due. This action constitutes a breach, and the nonbreaching party has two main choices: treat it as a final breach by pursuing remedies or wait to see if the breaching party will decide to honor the contract despite the avowed intention.
x??

---
#### Retraction of Repudiation
Background context: The UCC allows the breaching party to retract their repudiation, provided they clearly indicate an intent to perform (UCC 2-610). This retraction can be done through any method that makes it clear the party intends to fulfill their obligations.
:p Can a repudiation of a contract be retracted?
??x
Yes, a repudiation of a contract can be retracted. The breaching party must clearly indicate an intent to perform by using any method that conveys this intention. This means they need to provide clear communication that shows their commitment to honoring the contract.

#### Case in Point 22.14: Hemacare Plus, Inc. vs Cardinal Health 108, LLC
Background context: In this case, Hemacare Plus, Inc., ordered more than $660,000 in specialty pharmaceutical products from Cardinal Health 108, LLC. Despite not paying for the delivered goods and failing to reject them within a reasonable period, Hemacare used the pharmaceutical products. As a result, the court found that Hemacare had accepted the goods based on their use.
:p What did the court rule in Hemacare Plus, Inc. vs Cardinal Health 108, LLC?
??x
The court ruled that because Hemacare Plus, Inc., had used the pharmaceutical products and failed to reject them within a reasonable period, they were deemed to have accepted the goods. This acceptance led to an award of $688,920 in damages (including interest, attorneys’ fees, and costs) from Hemacare to Cardinal Health.

#### The Right to Recover Damages for Nonacceptance of Goods
When a buyer or lessee repudiates a contract or wrongfully refuses to accept goods, the seller or lessor can seek damages. Typically, the amount of damages is the difference between the contract price or lease payments and the market price at the time and place of tender [UCC 2-708(1), 2A-528(1)]. If this measure is inadequate to put the seller in a better position than the buyer’s performance would have, lost profits can be claimed as an alternative.
:p What does the seller or lessor typically seek when a buyer or lessee repudiates a contract?
??x
The seller or lessor seeks damages, which are usually calculated as the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time of tender. If this measure is insufficient, lost profits can also be claimed.

#### Effect of Insolvency on Delivery of Goods in Transit
If the seller or lessor learns that the buyer or lessee is insolvent, they have the right to stop delivery of goods still in transit regardless of the quantity shipped. However, if the breach does not result in insolvency and only a carload or larger shipment has been sent, the seller or lessor can only stop the delivery.
:p What action can a seller or lessor take when they learn their buyer is insolvent?
??x
A seller or lessor can stop the delivery of goods still in transit if the buyer is insolvent. If the breach does not result in insolvency and the shipment quantity is at least a carload, truckload, planeload, or larger, the seller or lessor must ship the entire quantity before stopping delivery.

#### Requirements for Stopping Delivery of Goods in Transit
To stop the delivery of goods in transit, the seller or lessor must notify the carrier or bailee that the goods are to be returned or held. If the carrier has sufficient time, they must hold and deliver the goods according to the seller or lessor's instructions. The seller or lessor is responsible for any additional costs incurred by the carrier.
:p What must a seller or lessor do to stop delivery of goods in transit?
??x
A seller or lessor must notify the carrier or bailee that the goods are to be returned or held, and if the carrier has sufficient time, they must hold the goods and deliver them according to the instructions. The seller or lessor is liable for any additional costs incurred by the carrier.

#### When Goods Are in the Possession of the Buyer or Lessee
When the buyer or lessee breaches a contract while possessing the goods, the seller or lessor can sue for recovery of the purchase price or lease payments due, plus incidental damages. In some cases, the seller may also have the right to reclaim the goods.
:p What can the seller or lessor do if the buyer breaches the contract and retains possession of the goods?
??x
The seller or lessor can recover the purchase price or lease payments due, plus incidental damages from the buyer or lessee. In certain sales contracts, the seller may also have a right to reclaim the goods from an insolvent buyer.

#### Example: Stopping Delivery Due to Insolvency
Arturo Ortega orders lumber from Timber Products, Inc., and fails to pay for a previous shipment. After shipping the lumber, Ortega files for bankruptcy. If the goods are still in transit, Timber Products can stop delivery by notifying the carrier or bailee.
:p In what situation can Timber Products stop the delivery of lumber still in transit?
??x
Timber Products can stop the delivery if Arturo Ortega is insolvent and has filed for bankruptcy. They must notify the carrier to hold or return the goods until a resolution.

#### Notification of Breach
Background context: When a buyer or lessee discovers a defect in goods, they must notify the seller or lessor within a reasonable time. Failure to provide this notice can bar the buyer from seeking any remedy. Additionally, parties can include specific provisions in their contract requiring timely notification.
:p What is required for the buyer or lessee if they discover a defect in goods?
??x
The buyer or lessee must notify the seller or lessor of the defect within a reasonable time after discovering it. Failing to do so may prevent them from pursuing any remedy, as outlined by UCC 2-607(3) and 2A-516(3).

---
#### Measure of Damages
Background context: The measure of damages for non-conforming goods is generally the difference between the value of the goods as accepted and their returned value. This can be applied when goods do not meet contractual expectations.
:p How are damages calculated in a sales or lease contract if the goods do not conform to the contract?
??x
Damages are typically measured by the difference between the value of the non-conforming goods as accepted and their returned value. If the goods were pre-paid, the buyer may have no right to recover the purchase price unless they reject or revoke acceptance.

#### Rejection vs. Revocation
Background context: Under UCC 2-602(1) and 2-608(1), a buyer can cancel the contract by rejecting goods that fail to conform in any way. Alternatively, if the nonconformity substantially impairs value, the buyer may revoke acceptance. Both actions require timely notification.
:p What are the key differences between rejection and revocation of acceptance?
??x
Rejection allows the buyer to cancel the contract and recover the purchase price for goods that do not conform in any way. Revocation is available if nonconformity substantially impairs value, provided the buyer accepts on the assumption it will be cured but was not timely fixed. Both require timely notification.

---
#### Reasonable Time for Notification
Background context: The concept of a reasonable time depends on the nature, purpose, and circumstances of the action. In contracts, this can affect whether remedies are available to the buyer or lessee.
:p How is "reasonable time" determined in contract law?
??x
The determination of a "reasonable time" for notification varies based on the context: the nature, purpose, and specific circumstances of the transaction. This is crucial because failure to notify within a reasonable time can prevent recovery of damages or cancellation rights.

---
#### Continued Use Post-Rejection/Revocation
Background context: If a buyer uses goods after rejecting or revoking acceptance, this may negate their right to cancel the contract and recover the purchase price. The use must not cause substantial hardship.
:p Can a buyer's continued use of goods after rejection or revocation affect their claim?
??x
Yes, if a buyer continues using goods after purportedly revoking acceptance without facing significant hardship, it can negate their right to cancel the contract and seek a refund. The use must be necessary to avoid substantial difficulty for it to maintain the claim.

---
#### Exclusive Remedies
Background context: The parties to a sales or lease contract can agree on exclusive remedies, meaning these are the sole remedies available unless they fail in their essential purpose. This is governed by UCC 2-719(2) and 2A-503(2).

:p What does it mean for a remedy to be "exclusive" under sales or lease contracts?
??x
When parties state that a remedy is exclusive, it means this remedy is the sole available remedy unless it fails in its essential purpose. For instance, if the contract limits the buyer's remedy exclusively to repair or replacement of any defective parts, then this becomes the only remedy unless such remedy cannot fulfill the buyer’s recovery needs.

#### Consequential Damages
Background context: Under the UCC, parties can limit or exclude consequential damages as long as these limitations are not unconscionable. However, when the buyer is a consumer, any limitation of consequential damages for personal injuries resulting from consumer goods is presumed to be unconscionable.

:p How do parties to a contract under the UCC handle consequential damages?
??x
Parties can limit or exclude consequential damages provided that such limitations are not unconscionable. For consumers, limiting consequential damages for personal injuries related to consumer goods is generally considered unconscionable.

#### Notice Requirement and Its Impact on Consequential Damages
Background context: The notice requirement policy allows the seller to cure the breach by making adjustments or replacements to minimize the buyer’s damages and the seller’s liability. However, this does not apply if the defect in the goods cannot be remedied even with immediate notification.

:p What is the impact of the notice requirement on minimizing damage?
??x
The notice requirement policy aims to allow the seller to correct defects by making adjustments or replacements to minimize buyer’s damages and seller’s liability. If the defect (like an altered baseball card) renders the item worthless regardless of when the buyer notifies the seller, the policies behind this requirement do not unfairly prejudice the seller.
