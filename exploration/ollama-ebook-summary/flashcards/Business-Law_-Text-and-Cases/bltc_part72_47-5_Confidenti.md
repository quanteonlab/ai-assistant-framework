**Starting Chapter:** 47-5 Confidentiality and Privilege

---

#### Attorney-Client Relationship Confidentiality
Attorneys and their employees are bound by professional ethics to maintain confidentiality of communications with clients. This ensures that clients feel safe sharing sensitive information without fear of it being disclosed.
:p What does attorney-client relationship confidentiality entail?
??x
Attorney-client relationship confidentiality means that all communications between the client and the attorney, as well as any employees involved in representation, are strictly confidential. Attorneys cannot disclose these communications to anyone outside the legal team unless authorized by the client. This protection is essential for encouraging clients to fully disclose information necessary for proper legal advice.

#### Professional Liability and Accountability - Sarbanes-Oxley Act Exemption
Background context: The Sarbanes-Oxley Act is a United States federal law that aims to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures. It places significant responsibilities on public companies and their executives, auditors, and accountants.

#### Potential Liability to Third Parties - KPMG Case

Background context: In 2006, twenty-seven entities became limited partners in two hedge funds that had invested with Bernard Madoff and his investment firm. The partners’ investment adviser gave them various investment information, including a memorandum indicating that an independent certified public accountant (CPA), KPMG, LLP, had audited the hedge funds' annual reports. Since 2004, KPMG had also prepared annual reports addressed to the funds' "Partners." Each report stated that KPMG had investigated the funds’ financial statements, had followed generally accepted auditing principles (GAAP), and had concluded that the statements fairly summarized the funds’ financial conditions. Moreover, KPMG had used the information from its audits to prepare individual tax statements for each fund partner.

KPMG provided audit reports indicating compliance with GAAP, yet these reports did not prevent partners from losing millions of dollars due to Madoff's Ponzi scheme. In 2008, Madoff was charged with securities fraud, and in 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) identified numerous "red flags" that should have been discovered by investment advisers and auditors.

:p Is KPMG potentially liable to the funds’ partners under the Restatement (Third) of Torts?
??x
KPMG may be potentially liable to the funds' partners under the Restatement (Third) of Torts, particularly if it can be shown that KPMG owed a duty of care to the partners and breached that duty. Under this framework, potential liability could arise from:

1. **Duty of Care:** If the court finds that KPMG had a duty of care towards the limited partners by virtue of its audit reports.
2. **Breach of Duty:** Whether KPMG’s conduct fell below the standard of care expected in professional practice.
3. **Causation:** If it can be established that KPMG’s negligence directly caused the partners to suffer financial losses due to their reliance on the misleading audit reports.

If these elements are met, KPMG could be held liable for failing to detect red flags and providing erroneous or incomplete information, which led to significant financial losses for the partners.

#### Potential Liability to Third Parties - Rojas Case

Background context: Luis and Maria Rojas contracted to buy a house in Westchester County, New York, from Andrew and Karen Paine. The property was described as "Lot No. 8" on a subdivision map filed with the county clerk's office. However, the Paines had acquired the property in two parts by transferring two separate deeds. They provided a deed stating it covered "the same property," but actually, the legal description attached to the deed only covered part of Lot No. 8.

Attorney Paul Herrick represented the Rojases during this transaction. When the Rojases sought to sell the property two years later, they discovered that they owned only part of Lot No. 8, leading a potential buyer to back out from the deal.

:p Is Herrick liable for malpractice?
??x
Attorney Paul Herrick may be liable for malpractice if he breached his duty of care owed to the Rojases during their real estate transaction with Andrew and Karen Paine. To determine liability, consider:

1. **Duty of Care:** Did Herrick owe a duty of care to the Rojases? As their legal representative, he had an obligation to ensure that they received accurate information about the property.
2. **Breach of Duty:** Was there any negligence or breach in his performance of this duty? For instance, did he fail to properly research and verify the accuracy of the legal description provided by Paine?
3. **Causation:** Did Herrick's actions (or lack thereof) directly cause the Rojases' loss when they discovered that their deed covered only a portion of Lot No. 8?

If all these elements are proven, Herrick could be held liable for professional malpractice.

#### Attorney Misconduct - Solomons One Case

Background context: Solomons One, LLC was formed to develop waterfront property in Maryland. Vernon Donnelly served as the company's counsel. When the state denied Solomons’s request for a permit to build a pier, Donnelly appealed this denial. Simultaneously, he assigned Solomons’s potential right to build a pier to a trust and changed his fee arrangement with the company.

:p Did Donnelly engage in misconduct?
??x
Vernon Donnelly may have engaged in misconduct if it can be shown that his actions breached professional ethics or standards of practice. Specifically:

1. **Conflict of Interest:** By assigning Solomons’s potential right to build a pier to a trust and changing his fee arrangement, Donnelly could potentially have created a conflict of interest.
2. **Duty of Loyalty:** He may have acted in a manner that was not in the best interests of Solomons One, LLC or its members.
3. **Misuse of Client Information:** Transferring client property rights without proper authorization and changing fee arrangements could be seen as improper use of client information.

If these actions violated ethical rules or professional standards, Donnelly would likely face disciplinary action or legal liability for his conduct.

Relevant formulas or data: Specific savings targets vary by state but generally aim to increase overall efficiency.

:p What do many states require from their utility companies?
??x
Many states require their utility companies to save specified amounts of energy through the adoption of more efficient technologies in operations and encouraging customers to become more energy-efficient. These standards are intended to reduce overall energy consumption and promote sustainability.

#### Regional Climate Initiatives
Background context: Several regional initiatives have been formed, such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) in the northeastern United States, which sets an emissions budget for each state and allows trading of credits.
Relevant formulas or data: The RGGI sets specific emission caps and enables states to invest proceeds from these efforts into renewable energy programs.

:p What is an example of a regional climate initiative?
??x
An example of a regional climate initiative is the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). It involves nine northeastern U.S. states that set emissions budgets for power plants, allowing credits to be traded and investments in renewable energy programs to be made from the proceeds.
