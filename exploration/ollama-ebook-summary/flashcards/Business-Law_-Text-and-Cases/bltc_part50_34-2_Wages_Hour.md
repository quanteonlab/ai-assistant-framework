#### Minimum Wage Provisions
Background context: The FLSA mandates a minimum wage for covered, non-exempt employees. Many states also have their own minimum wages, often higher than the federal minimum. When state laws set a higher minimum wage, workers are entitled to that higher rate.

#### Polygraph and Drug Testing
Background context explaining the concept. Federal, state, and local government employers, as well as certain security service firms, may conduct polygraph tests under specific circumstances. Additionally, companies that manufacture and distribute controlled substances can perform lie-detector tests. Other employers can use polygraph tests to investigate losses attributable to theft, including embezzlement and the theft of trade secrets.

Drug testing is conducted by many employers in the interests of public safety and to reduce unnecessary costs. Public employers are constrained in drug testing by the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures. However, courts have generally upheld drug testing of certain employees when it can be shown that drug use in a particular job may threaten public safety or there is reasonable suspicion of drug use.

Private employers are not subject to the Fourth Amendment, but their drug testing practices are governed by state law. Many states allow private employers to conduct drug tests, provided they comply with specific regulations regarding when and how these tests can be performed. Collective bargaining agreements may also provide protections against drug testing or authorize it under certain conditions.

:p What is the primary purpose of conducting polygraph tests in government and security firms?
??x
Polygraph tests are primarily used for investigating losses attributable to theft, including embezzlement and the theft of trade secrets.
