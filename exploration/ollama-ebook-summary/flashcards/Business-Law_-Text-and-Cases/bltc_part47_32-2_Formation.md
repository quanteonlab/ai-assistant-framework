**Starting Chapter:** 32-2 Formation of the Agency Relationship

---

#### Agency by Estoppel
Background context: When a principal causes a third person to believe that another person is their agent, and the third party acts on this belief to their detriment, the principal may be "estopped" from denying the agency relationship. This doctrine prevents the principal from asserting they were not actually in an agency relationship.
:p What does the term "agency by estoppel" mean?
??x
Agency by estoppel means that a principal is prevented from denying the existence of an agency relationship when their conduct has induced a third party to believe such a relationship exists, and the third party acts on this belief to their detriment. 
Example: If a company's CEO regularly uses an employee as if they were authorized to sign contracts, and another company relies on this behavior by signing a contract believing the employee had authority, the first company cannot later deny the employee was acting as their agent.
```java
// Pseudocode Example:
if (CEO.usesEmployeeAsAgent) {
    thirdParty.relyOn(CEO);
} else {
    // Denying agency would not be allowed due to estoppel principles
}
```
x??

#### Third Party’s Reasonable Reliance
Background context: For the doctrine of agency by estoppel to apply, the third party must reasonably believe that an agency relationship exists. This belief needs to be based on facts and circumstances such that a prudent person would also conclude there was authority.
:p How does the court determine if a third party's reliance is reasonable in an agency by estoppel case?
??x
The court determines if a third party’s reliance is reasonable based on whether, given all the facts and circumstances, a reasonably prudent person familiar with business practices and customs would have concluded that the purported agent had authority.
Example: If a hospital patient believes a physician who frequently acts for the hospital has authority to prescribe medication due to consistent behavior by the hospital staff, this could be considered reasonable reliance if similar actions were common practice.
```java
// Pseudocode Example:
if (prudentPersonBelieves(Patient.relianceOnPhysician)) {
    // Reasonable reliance established
} else {
    // Insufficient evidence of reasonable belief
}
```
x??

---
#### Acts or Declarations by the Principal
Background context: The doctrine of agency by estoppel is not created solely by the acts or declarations of a purported agent. Instead, it is based on the deeds or statements made by the principal that create an appearance of authority.
:p What creates an agency by estoppel according to this text?
??x
An agency by estoppel is created when the principal's actions or declarations induce a third party to believe there is an agency relationship, and the third party acts on this belief. The principal’s conduct must make it appear as though the other person had authority.
Example: If a CEO repeatedly approves invoices from an employee without proper authorization, this could lead to the doctrine of estoppel when the employee uses similar approval methods in dealings with suppliers.
```java
// Pseudocode Example:
if (principalConductAppearsToGiveAuthority) {
    // Creates agency by estoppel
} else {
    // No basis for estoppel due to lack of apparent authority
}
```

#### Case Application: Francis Azur vs Chase Bank
Background context: In this case, Francis Azur was the CEO of ATM Corporation and Michelle Vanek, his personal assistant, took unauthorized cash advances from his credit card account. When Azur discovered the fraud, he argued that Chase should not have allowed Vanek to take advances based on his conduct.
:p How did the court rule in this case?
??x
The court ruled that Azur (the principal) had given Chase (the third party) reason to believe that Michelle Vanek (the purported agent) had authority. Therefore, Azur was estopped from denying Vanek's authority to take cash advances.
Explanation: Azur’s repeated use of the credit card and his failure to correct Vanek’s unauthorized actions created an appearance of authority, leading to agency by estoppel.
```java
// Pseudocode Example:
if (Azur.RepeatedUseOfCreditCard && Azur.FailedToCorrectVanek) {
    // Chase had reasonable belief in Vanek's authority
} else {
    // No estoppel due to lack of apparent authority
}
```

#### Hospital Case: Riedel vs Akron General Health System
Background context: This case involves a hospital emergency room physician who was an independent contractor. The patient, Aaron Riedel, filed a lawsuit against the hospital alleging medical malpractice resulting in paraplegia.
:p Did the court find that the hospital could be held liable based on agency by estoppel?
??x
The court did not explicitly rule on whether the doctrine of agency by estoppel applied to the independent contractor physician. However, if the hospital had created an appearance of authority through its actions or statements, it may have been estopped from denying the agency relationship.
Explanation: The case focuses on whether Kalapodis (the physician) was properly considered an agent for Akron General Health System, and the court's findings could influence potential application of estoppel principles.
```java
// Pseudocode Example:
if (Hospital.CreatedAppearanceOfAuthority && Hospital.ReasonablyBelievedByRiedel) {
    // Potential agency by estoppel applies
} else {
    // Insufficient evidence for estoppel
}
```

#### Principal-Agent Relationship and Fiduciary Duties
Background context explaining that a principal-agent relationship is based on trust, with each party obligated to act in utmost good faith. The duties include performance, notification, loyalty, obedience, and accounting.

:p What are the five main duties an agent owes to their principal?
??x
The five main duties an agent owes to their principal are:
1. Performance: The agent agrees to use reasonable diligence and skill in performing tasks.
2. Notification: The agent must inform the principal of matters relevant to the agency.
3. Loyalty: The agent must not act against the interests of the principal.
4. Obedience: The agent must follow the instructions given by the principal within their authority.
5. Accounting: The agent must account for all actions taken on behalf of the principal.

x??

---
#### Performance Standard
Background context explaining that performance involves using reasonable diligence and skill, with a standard of ordinary care unless the agent has claimed special skills, in which case they are expected to meet those claims.

:p What is the general standard of care an agent must follow when performing their duties?
??x
The general standard of care an agent must follow is ordinary care. However, if the agent represents themselves as having special skills or expertise, they are expected to exercise the degree of skill claimed. This means that failing to meet the stated level of skill can constitute a breach of duty.

Example: If an agent claims to be an experienced real estate broker and performs below this level, they could be liable for negligence.

x??

#### Gratuitous Agents
Background context explaining that not all agency relationships are based on contracts, some agents act gratuitously (without payment), thus their liability is limited to torts. They still have a duty to perform in an acceptable manner.

:p What type of agents do not have contractual liability?
??x
Gratuitous agents do not have contractual liability because there is no formal contract between the agent and principal. Their duties are primarily governed by tort law, which imposes a standard of reasonable care. Once they begin acting as an agent, they have a duty to perform in an acceptable manner.

Example: If Alcott (acting gratuitously) fails to sell Bower’s vacation home due to negligence, Bower can sue for damages under negligence rather than breach of contract.

x??

---
#### Notification Duty
Background context explaining that agents must inform the principal about matters relevant to the agency. Failure to do so could result in legal consequences.

:p What is the duty of notification or information?
??x
The duty of notification requires an agent to inform the principal about all matters concerning the subject matter of the agency. This includes important facts that might affect the principal's decisions, such as potential financial risks or changes in circumstances.

Example: If Perez’s agent learns that Barber Art Gallery is insolvent and may not be able to purchase paintings, they have a duty to inform Perez so that he can make an informed decision about whether to proceed with the sale.

#### Formation of Agency Relationship
Background context explaining how agency relationships are formed through express consent, implied conduct, ratification, emergency situations, or operation of law. Provides examples for each method.

:p How is the agency relationship typically formed?
??x
The agency relationship can be formed in several ways:
1. **By Agreement**: The principal explicitly consents to the agent's actions.
2. **By Ratification**: The principal approves the agent's actions after they have been taken, even if not initially authorized.
3. **By Estoppel or Operation of Law**: When a third party relies on the belief that someone is an agent, and this reliance causes harm.

Example: If Bower’s friend Alcott offers to sell Bower’s vacation home at no charge, Bower has no legal right to force Alcott to complete the sale. However, if Alcott negligently fails in their attempt to sell it, Bower can sue for negligence.

#### Principal-Agent Relationship and Cooperation Duty

Background context: In a principal-agent relationship, the agent is given authority to act on behalf of the principal. The duty of cooperation ensures that the principal assists the agent in performing their duties without interference.

:p What does the principal's duty of cooperation entail?
??x
The principal must cooperate with the agent and assist in performing their duties by doing nothing to prevent the performance. For instance, if a principal grants an exclusive territory to an agent, they cannot compete or allow others to compete within that territory.
x??

---

#### Exclusive Agency

Background context: An exclusive agency is created when a principal grants an agent a specific territory where only the agent can sell products. The principal is prohibited from competing with the agent or allowing others to do so.

:p What happens if a principal violates an exclusive agency agreement?
??x
If the principal competes within the agent's territory, they violate the exclusive agency and may be held liable for the agent's lost profits.
For example:
```java
public class Principal {
    private String name;
    private List<Agent> agents;

    public Principal(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void competeInTerritory(Agent agent, Territory territory) {
        // Competing with the agent in their exclusive territory
        System.out.println(name + " competed against " + agent.getName() + " in " + territory.getRegion());
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Example of Exclusive Agency Violation

Background context: In this example, Penny creates an exclusive agency for Andrew by granting him a territory. If Penny starts selling products within Andrew's territory or permits another agent to do so, Penny violates the agreement and is liable for Andrew’s lost sales.

:p What is the outcome if Penny competes with Andrew in his exclusive territory?
??x
Penny would be held liable for Andrew’s lost sales or profits because she violated the exclusive agency agreement.
```java
public class ExclusiveAgency {
    public void competeWithAgent(String principalName, String agentName) {
        // Violation of the exclusive agency agreement
        System.out.println(principalName + " competed with " + agentName);
    }
}
```

#### Real Estate Agency Agreement

Background context: In this case, Christopher Jones entered into an exclusive right to represent buyer agreement with Andrea Woolston. Woolston spent considerable time searching for properties for Jones and Wiltshire.

:p What did Woolston do for Christopher Jones?
??x
Woolston conducted extensive research on available properties at six town halls in the communities of interest. She showcased numerous properties personally to Jones and Wiltshire, introduced many through email, and had multiple appointments viewing properties together.
```java
public class Realtor {
    private String name;
    private Buyer buyer;

    public Realtor(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void searchPropertiesForBuyer(Buyer buyer) {
        // Conducting property searches for the buyer
        System.out.println(name + " searched properties for " + buyer.getName());
    }
}
```

#### Agency Formation and Duties Overview
This section discusses how agency relationships are formed, including scenarios involving instructions from principals to agents. It also touches on the distinction between an agent's inherent authority and express instructions given by a principal.

:p What is an example of an agent violating their principal's instructions?
??x
An example would be Moore adding a warranty for the used car’s engine when Parker instructed him not to make any warranties. This act goes against Parker’s explicit instructions, potentially making Parker liable to Walters for any issues arising from this unauthorized action.
x??

---

#### Instructions and Authority
This concept explains how agents can have inherent authority beyond specific instructions given by principals.

:p What might Logan do in Gutierrez's office supply company when a large order comes in?
??x
Logan would likely have the inherent authority to purchase more inventory despite Gutierrez’s command not to. The situation suggests that purchasing necessary inventory to meet customer demand is within his usual duties and responsibilities.

#### Independent Contractor vs. Employee
This topic differentiates between independent contractors and employees, highlighting key characteristics.

:p What factors would a court consider in determining Scott's status as an employee or independent contractor?
??x
A court would likely consider factors such as whether Scott provided services personally (independent contractor) or whether she had control over the work methods and results (employee). Other considerations include how much financial risk was borne by Scott, who controlled aspects like hiring staff and purchasing supplies, and whether there were any restrictions on her ability to work for other companies.
x??

---

#### Court Ruling on Employee Status
This scenario involves a legal dispute between an independent contractor and their client.

:p How would the court likely rule regarding Scott's employee status?
??x
The court is likely to rule that Scott was an independent contractor rather than an employee. This conclusion would be based on the lack of control over her work methods, her personal financial risk, the ability to sell competing products, and Blatt’s withholding of client information without affecting Scott's ability to independently perform services for Massachusetts Mutual.
x??

---

#### Breach of Agency Duties
This section addresses potential breaches in an agency relationship.

:p Which duty has been most likely breached by Blatt?
??x
The duty of indemnification is probably the one that has been breached. By withholding client information, Blatt prevented Scott from fulfilling her duties effectively, potentially leading to losses for both Massachusetts Mutual and herself.
x??

---

#### Cohosting an Internet-Streaming Program
This example involves a situation where an independent contractor works with another firm on a project-by-project basis.

:p What type of agreement do Winona and XtremeCast have?
??x
Winona and XtremeCast have a contract for each episode, indicating that they work on a project-by-project basis. This suggests they are likely independent contractors rather than employees.

#### Employee versus Independent Contractor (Hemmerling Case)
Stephen Hemmerling worked for Happy Cab Company as a driver. He paid fixed expenses, followed rules about cab usage and hours of work, and solicited fares according to company guidelines. Rates were set by the state, but taxes were not withheld from his pay.
:p How might the court determine that Hemmerling was an employee?
??x
The court could hold that Hemmerling was an employee based on several factors:
1. **Control**: Hemmerling had limited control over how he performed his duties, as Happy Cab set rules and guidelines for him to follow.
2. **Integration into the Business**: His work was integrated into the business operations of Happy Cab.
3. **Supervision**: While not explicitly stated, there may have been some level of supervision or control by Happy Cab.

These factors suggest a more employee-like relationship rather than that of an independent contractor.

#### Employment Relationships (Moore Case)
William Moore owned Moore Enterprises and his son Jonathan worked there during high school. Later, Jonathan started Morecedes Tire, which competed with Moore Enterprises. A decade later, William offered Jonathan employment at Moore Enterprises but did not provide specific instructions on how to perform the task.
:p Was Jonathan an independent contractor when he was injured?
??x
Jonathan was likely considered an employee rather than an independent contractor based on the following factors:
1. **Control**: There is no evidence that William provided detailed instructions or supervised Jonathan's work. However, given his previous employment relationship and the nature of the task, it may be argued that some level of control existed.
2. **Integration into the Business**: The task was part of Moore Enterprises' operations.

The lack of specific instructions does not necessarily mean he was an independent contractor. Given the context and typical practices in such scenarios, Jonathan would likely be considered an employee.

#### Agent’s Duties to Principal (Miller Case)
William and Maxine Miller were shareholders of Claimsco International Inc. They sued Michael Harris, Kenneth Hoxie, and John Verchota, alleging that Verchota had breached a duty owed to them. The allegations included adjusting the company's books and falsely reporting distributions.
:p What specific duty did the Millers allege was breached by Verchota?
??x
The Millers alleged that Verchota breached his duty of loyalty to the shareholders. This duty includes:
1. **Fiduciary Duty**: Acting in the best interest of the shareholders.
2. **Obligation Not to Compete**: Not engaging in activities that would harm the company or shareholders.
3. **Proper Record Keeping and Reporting**: Accurately recording transactions and reporting financial information.

Verchota's actions, such as adjusting books to maximize Millers' liabilities and making false reports, could be seen as a breach of these duties.

#### Determining Employee Status (Ovalles Case)
Nelson Ovalles worked for Cox Rhode Island Telecom under an agreement with M&M Communications. The agreement stated no employer-employee relationship existed between Cox and M&M’s technicians. However, Cox required Ovalles to display its affiliation on his van, clothing, and badge.
:p Was Ovalles an employee or independent contractor?
??x
Ovalles was likely considered an employee based on the following factors:
1. **Control**: While there is limited direct control by Cox over Ovalles' work, the necessity to display company affiliation suggests some level of control and integration into the business.
2. **Integration into the Business**: The requirement for Ovalles to represent Cox in his work implies he was part of its operations.

The minimal contact and lack of detailed instructions from Cox do not necessarily negate an employee-employee relationship, as other factors like representation and affiliation are significant.
x??

---

#### Accident Case (Ovalles Case)
Nelson Ovalles worked as a cable installer for Cox Rhode Island Telecom under M&M Communications. His van was involved in an accident while he was performing his duties.
:p Was the incident involving Barbara Cayer's car considered a work-related accident?
??x
The incident involving Barbara Cayer's car could be considered a work-related accident based on the following:
1. **Scope of Employment**: Since Ovalles was working on a job for Cox at the time of the accident, it falls within his scope of employment.
2. **Employer Liability**: As an employee of Cox (through M&M), Cox may be liable for any accidents that occur during his work.

This would make the incident eligible for workers' compensation benefits under most jurisdictions.
