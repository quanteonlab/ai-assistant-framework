**Starting Chapter:** 15-2 Fraudulent Misrepresentation

---

---
#### Contracts and E-Contracts
Background context explaining the initial agreement between parties. Each party assumes risk that value will change or differ from expectations, without this rule, any party could argue mistake.

:p What is the nature of agreements when forming a contract?
??x
Parties agree on the value of transaction objects at the moment, and each party assumes risk for potential future changes or discrepancies in perceived value.
x??

#### Fraudulent Misrepresentation: Overview
Explanation that fraudulent misrepresentation involves a misstatement of fact with intent to deceive. It includes elements like materiality, intent, reliance, and harm.

:p What is required to prove fraudulent misrepresentation?
??x
To prove fraudulent misrepresentation, the following elements must be met:
1. A misrepresentation of a material fact.
2. Intent to deceive.
3. Justifiable reliance on the misrepresentation by the innocent party.
4. Harm resulting from the misrepresentation.

For example, if someone states "This painting is by Picasso" when it is not, and this leads to a sale under false pretenses, it constitutes fraudulent misrepresentation.
x??

---
#### Fraudulent Misrepresentation: Elements
Explanation of each element needed for proving fraud:
- Material fact must be misrepresented.
- Intentional deception (conscious falsity).
- Innocent party justifiably relies on the misstatement.
- Harm resulting from the misrepresentation.

:p What are the four elements required to prove fraudulent misrepresentation?
??x
1. A misrepresentation of a material fact.
2. An intent to deceive.
3. The innocent party must justifiably rely on the misrepresentation.
4. The innocent party must be harmed as a result of the misrepresentation.

#### Fraudulent Misrepresentation: Case Context
Explanation that fraudulent misrepresentation involves conscious false statements or beliefs with the intent to lead another into error, and an example is given involving a gallery owner misleading a customer.

:p What does fraudulent misrepresentation typically consist of?
??x
Fraudulent misrepresentation typically consists of:
- A misstatement of material fact.
- An intention to deceive (conscious falsity).
- Justifiable reliance by the innocent party on the misrepresentation.
- Harm resulting from the misrepresentation.
For example, if a gallery owner knowingly leads a customer to paintings not done by Jasper Johns when the customer asked specifically for such works, this could be considered fraudulent misrepresentation.
x??

---
#### Merger Clause and Fraud
Explanation of merger clauses in contracts. A clause stating that the contract contains the entire agreement between parties, thus no separate agreements are considered.

:p What is a merger clause?
??x
A merger clause is a contractual provision stating that the document contains the entire agreement between the parties, thereby excluding other separate agreements from consideration when interpreting the contract.
x??

---
#### Merger Clause and Allegation of Fraud
Explanation that in a case involving multiple claims, one party might argue the damage resulted from a single claim while another reports it as multiple.

:p How does Allstate's reporting affect McCullough’s claim?
??x
Allstate reported multiple claims to Verisk Analytics A-PLUS when McCullough contended that only one claim caused the damage. This discrepancy could be a basis for dispute over the validity of the claims and potentially fraud.
x??

---
#### Misrepresentation of Law
Background context: In contract law, misrepresentation occurs when a party provides false information that influences another party's decision to enter into a contract. Ordinarily, misrepresentations do not entitle the misled party to relief from the contract unless certain conditions are met.

:p What is the general rule regarding misrepresentation in contracts?
??x
Misrepresentation of law ordinarily does not entitle a party to relief from a contract.
x??
This means that if one party provides incorrect information about the legal aspects relevant to a contract, such as zoning laws, and this misinformation influences the other party's decision, the misled party generally cannot avoid the contract. However, there are exceptions where misrepresentation can lead to rescission or damages.

---

#### Selleck v. Cuenca
Background context: This case is an exception where misrepresentation of law could result in relief. The rule that misrepresentations about legal facts typically do not provide a basis for avoiding the contract may be overridden if the party making the false statement is in a profession that requires more legal knowledge than the average person.

:p How does Selleck v. Cuenca illustrate an exception to the general rule?
??x
If Camara, in Example 15.7, had been a lawyer or a real estate broker, her willful misrepresentation of the area’s zoning laws probably would have constituted fraud.
x??
In this scenario, if Camara (a real estate broker) falsely claimed that a property could be built to a hundred stories high when local ordinances prohibited such construction, and she knew this information, her statement could be considered fraudulent. This is because people in the real estate profession are expected to have greater knowledge of legal zoning laws.

---

#### Misrepresentation by Silence
Background context: Unlike misrepresentations made through statements, silence does not automatically constitute fraud unless there is a duty to disclose. However, if one party has information that another cannot reasonably be expected to discover and this information is material, the failure to disclose it can still result in fraud.

:p Under what circumstances might non-disclosure of information lead to fraud?
??x
If a seller knows of a serious potential problem that the buyer cannot reasonably be expected to discover, the seller may have a duty to speak. Failing to disclose such defects could constitute fraud.
x??
For example, if Jim (the seller) is aware that his car has been in an accident but does not mention it when asked by a potential buyer, he would commit a fraudulent misrepresentation only if the purchaser specifically asks about extensive bodywork.

---

#### Intent to Deceive
Background context: For fraud to be established, there must be knowledge on the part of the party making the false statement that the facts are misrepresented. This intent is often referred to as scienter or "guilty knowledge."

:p What does scienter signify in the context of fraud?
??x
Scienter signifies an intent to deceive. It clearly exists if a party knows that a fact is not as stated.
x??
For instance, Richard Wright’s application for a business law professor position included false information about his past experiences. His knowledge of the falsity and intent to deceive make it clear that he exhibited scienter.

```java
public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String[] resume = {"Corporate President", "Teaching Experience"};
        boolean hasCriminalHistory = true;
        
        if (hasCriminalHistory && !verify(resume)) {
            System.out.println("Fraudulent application detected.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Application verified.");
        }
    }

    public static boolean verify(String[] resume) {
        // Logic to check for consistency and accuracy in the resume
        return true; // Simplified logic
    }
}
```
This example checks if a job applicant's resume is consistent with their criminal history, highlighting the importance of accurate disclosure.

#### Background of Property Condition and Reliance
Cronkelton tested some equipment at the property and knew that not all pieces were fully functioning. Shivley was responsible for winterizing the car wash, but the actual winterization process faced issues due to the building's design limitations.
:p What background information is provided about Cronkelton’s initial assessment of the property?
??x
Cronkelton tested some equipment at the property and knew that not all pieces were fully functioning. He was aware that some equipment was operational, while others were not. This testing occurred before Shivley promised to winterize the car wash.
x??

---

#### Winterization Agreement Between Parties
Shivley contacted Guaranteed Construction Services (Guaranteed) to ensure the car wash property would be properly winterized. A detailed e-mail from Guaranteed assured Cronkelton that the necessary steps were being taken, including antifreeze and securing floor heating.
:p What did Shivley promise to do in relation to the winterization of the property?
??x
Shivley promised to have Guaranteed Construction Services (Guaranteed) winterize the car wash with specific measures such as putting antifreeze into canisters, securing floor heating, blowing water out of all lines in self-serve bays and emptying tanks. Additionally, they would leave minimal heat on in the pump room.
x??

---

#### Issues Arising During Winterization
Despite the promise from Guaranteed, Strayer Company informed Guaranteed that the building was not designed to be winterized without leaving the heat on continuously. Shivley was aware that Huntington Bank had shut off the heat because the property was not generating income.
:p What issue arose during the process of winterizing the car wash?
??x
Strayer Company informed Guaranteed Construction Services that the building was not designed for proper winterization and suggested leaving the heat on to avoid problems, as the previous heating system had been turned off by Huntington Bank due to lack of income.
x??

---

#### Damage Observed Post-Closing
Cronkelton inspected the property after closing in June and immediately noticed damage from freezing. He found canisters with their tops exploded, indicating significant pipe damage.
:p What was Cronkelton’s initial observation upon inspecting the property post-closing?
??x
Upon inspecting the property post-closing, Cronkelton observed that large canisters had their tops blown off due to the explosion, and pipes were broken. This clearly indicated extensive freezing damage.
x??

---

#### Reliance on Shivley's Statements
Cronkelton testified that he relied on Shivley’s statements about the car wash’s condition because he believed the necessary winterization steps would be taken care of as promised. He had not inspected the property again after November 2009, believing the issues were resolved.
:p Why did Cronkelton unjustifiably rely on Shivley's statements?
??x
Cronkelton relied on Shivley’s statements because he believed that all necessary winterization steps would be completed as promised. He had no reason to inspect further after receiving the detailed e-mail from Guaranteed, which assured him of the property's readiness.
x??

---

#### Evidence of Cronkelton’s Reliance
Cronkelton did have the opportunity to inspect the property in November 2009 but chose not to do so. The evidence suggests that he was satisfied with Shivley’s assurances and did not conduct additional inspections before closing.
:p What evidence supports Cronkelton's reliance on Shivley?
??x
Evidence supports Cronkelton’s reliance because despite having the opportunity, he did not inspect the property again after November 2009. He trusted Shivley’s statements that the necessary winterization steps had been taken care of and believed the property was safe to purchase.

#### Online Fraudulent Misrepresentation Actionability
Online fraudulent misrepresentation refers to a scenario where someone creates a false persona online and engages in activities that cause harm to another person. This can include emotional distress, financial loss, or other forms of injury.

:p Can actions based on online fraudulent misrepresentation be actionable?
??x
Actions based on online fraudulent misrepresentation can be actionable under certain conditions. However, courts have generally found it difficult for victims to prove actual injury and meet the legal requirements necessary to bring a successful suit.
```java
public class Example {
    // Code to simulate an online interaction where one party falsely represents themselves.
}
```
x??

---
#### Legal Framework for Online Impersonation
Some states have laws that make it a crime to impersonate someone online. However, these laws typically do not apply if the persona is entirely fictional or there are no commercial, transactional, or regulatory components involved.

:p Are all cases of online impersonation actionable under state laws?
??x
Not all cases of online impersonation are actionable under state laws. For example, in states where laws exist to punish impersonation, these typically do not apply when the persona is fully fictional and there's no commercial or transactional context.
```java
public class Example {
    // Code representing a legal system checking for impersonation offenses.
}
```
x??

---
#### Requirements for Damages in Fraudulent Misrepresentation Cases

In fraudulent misrepresentation cases, victims often struggle to prove actual injury. Courts generally require proof of an economic loss or harm that can be directly attributed to the false representations.

:p What is required to successfully sue for damages in a case involving fraudulent misrepresentation?
??x
To successfully sue for damages in a case involving fraudulent misrepresentation, victims need to demonstrate that they suffered an actual injury or economic loss as a result of the false representation. Courts have typically found it challenging for plaintiffs to meet this requirement.
```java
public class Example {
    // Code representing a plaintiff providing evidence of financial loss due to fraudulent misrepresentation.
}
```

#### Case Study: Paula Bonhomme v. Janna St. James

In the case of Paula Bonhomme, she engaged in an online relationship with someone who turned out to be an impostor. Despite significant emotional and financial distress, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled that she could not bring a suit for fraudulent misrepresentation because it involved a "purely personal relationship" without any commercial or transactional component.

:p How did Paula Bonhomme's case fail in court?
??x
Paula Bonhomme’s case failed in court because her claim of fraudulent misrepresentation was based on a “purely personal relationship” that lacked any commercial, transactional, or regulatory component. The Illinois Supreme Court ruled that the state had no valid public policy interest in regulating such purely private relationships.
```java
public class Example {
    // Code representing a legal system evaluating Paula Bonhomme's case for fraudulent misrepresentation.

#### Modern Cases and Digital Updates

Recent cases like Herrick v. Grindr, LLC and Beckman v. Match.com, LLC have involved digital platforms where users falsely represent themselves. These cases often revolve around the platform’s responsibility in verifying user identities or preventing impersonation.

:p Are there any recent legal updates on online fraudulent misrepresentation?
??x
Recent legal updates include cases such as Herrick v. Grindr, LLC and Beckman v. Match.com, LLC, where digital platforms have been scrutinized for their roles in allowing false personas to operate. These cases often focus on the platform's responsibility in verifying user identities or preventing impersonation.

#### Ethical Consideration of Cypress's Conduct
Background context: The case involves a seller, Cypress, who may have engaged in unethical behavior through misrepresentation (fraud) that did not negatively affect the property’s value at the time Fazio purchased it. This scenario examines whether such conduct is ethical and why.
:p Was Cypress’s conduct considered unethical? Why or why not?
??x
Cypress's conduct can be considered unethical if they made a false representation knowing it would influence Fazio's decision to purchase the property, even if it did not negatively affect its value at the time of purchase. Ethical standards in business require honesty and transparency. Misrepresentation, regardless of whether it impacts current market value, undermines trust and fairness.
x??

---
#### Social Implications for Sellers
Background context: The case highlights that Fazio was not entitled to damages because the misrepresentation had no negative impact on the property’s value at the time of purchase. This decision suggests potential consequences for sellers in commercial real estate transactions and business negotiations generally.
:p What does this case suggest to sellers of commercial real estate and others who engage in business negotiations?
??x
This case suggests that sellers must be cautious about making any misrepresentations, regardless of whether they impact the property's value. Transparency is crucial as even if a misrepresentation doesn’t negatively affect the current market value, it can still lead to legal challenges and potential ethical concerns. Sellers should ensure all representations are truthful to maintain trust in business negotiations.

#### Definition of Undue Influence
Background context: The concept of undue influence involves relationships where one party has the opportunity to dominate another, thereby overcoming their free will. Contracts formed under undue influence are voidable.
:p What is undue influence?
??x
Undue influence occurs when one party can significantly dominate and unfairly influence another party, overriding their free will. This relationship often arises in fiduciary roles such as guardianship, physician-patient, parent-child, or husband-wife relationships. Contracts entered into under undue influence are voidable.
x??

---
#### One Party Dominating the Other
Background context: The text explains that one party can dominate another, leading to undue influence. This is particularly relevant in situations like guardianship where a guardian may benefit financially from actions taken on behalf of their ward.
:p Can you explain the concept of 'one party dominating the other'?
??x
In various relationships, such as guardianship or fiduciary roles, one party can dominate another, potentially influencing them to make decisions that are not entirely voluntary. For example, a guardian might benefit financially from contracts entered on behalf of their ward, leading to undue influence if the ward’s free will is compromised.
x??

---
#### Presumption of Undue Influence
Background context: When the dominant party in a fiduciary relationship benefits financially from such a relationship, courts often presume that there was undue influence. This presumption can be rebutted with evidence of full disclosure and independent advice.
:p What is the presumption of undue influence?
??x
The presumption of undue influence arises when the dominant party in a fiduciary relationship benefits financially from the contract. Courts will likely assume undue influence unless the dominant party can show they made full disclosure, provided consideration, and ensured that the other party received independent and competent advice.
x??

---
#### Example of Presumption of Undue Influence
Background context: The example illustrates a scenario where a guardian (Erik) enters into a contract on behalf of his ward (Kinsley). If Kinsley challenges this contract, the court will likely presume undue influence unless Erik can provide evidence to the contrary.
:p Explain the example given for presumption of undue influence?
??x
In the example, Erik, as Kinsley's guardian, benefits financially from a contract entered on behalf of Kinsley. If Kinsley challenges this contract, the court is likely to presume undue influence because Erik has a dominant position over his ward. To rebut this presumption, Erik must show full disclosure, present consideration, and ensure that Kinsley received independent and competent advice.

---
#### Economic Duress
Economic duress occurs when one party is forced to enter into a contract due to threats that create significant pressure, making it impossible for the threatened party to act freely. In this situation, Eyman threatened to withdraw his services unless Weller signed a new agreement, which made it extremely difficult or nearly impossible for Weller to obtain adequate representation elsewhere by the deadline.
:p Can you explain what economic duress means in legal terms?
??x
Economic duress refers to circumstances where a party threatens to use coercive conduct that induces another party to enter into an agreement under severe economic pressure, effectively rendering their consent non-voluntary. In this case, Eyman's threat of withdrawing his services unless Weller signed the new contract put significant pressure on Weller.
x??

---
#### Adhesion Contracts
Adhesion contracts are agreements drafted by one party with overwhelming bargaining power and presented to another party in a take-it-or-leave-it fashion. These contracts often lack negotiation opportunities for the adhering party, making them essentially standard forms that impose terms dictated by the stronger party.
:p Define an adhesion contract.
??x
An adhesion contract is a pre-drafted agreement that one party (usually with significant bargaining power) imposes on another without meaningful opportunity to negotiate its terms. These contracts are often used in situations where there's a clear imbalance of power between parties, such as life insurance policies or employment agreements.
x??

---
#### Unconscionability
Unconscionability refers to the unfair and oppressive nature of a contract that is so one-sided or onerous that it shocks the conscience. Courts may find certain terms or entire contracts unenforceable if they are deemed unconscionable, especially in adhesion contracts where there's no room for negotiation.
:p What does unconscionability mean in legal terms?
??x
Unconscionability is a principle under which courts will invalidate contracts or specific clauses within them that are so one-sided or oppressive as to be shocking to the conscience. This concept often applies in adhesion contracts, where there's an imbalance of power and little opportunity for negotiation.
x??

---
#### Standard-Form Contracts
Standard-form contracts are widely used templates that businesses provide with limited room for negotiation. These contracts typically include pre-determined terms that benefit the drafting party, such as life insurance policies or employment agreements. Courts may scrutinize these contracts to ensure they are fair and not unconscionable.
:p Explain standard-form contracts in the context of business transactions.
??x
Standard-form contracts are standardized documents used by businesses for routine transactions with little room for negotiation. These contracts often include pre-determined terms that favor the drafting party, such as life insurance policies or employment agreements. Courts may scrutinize these contracts to ensure they are fair and not unconscionable.
x??

#### Case in Point 15.16
In this case, Gregory and Stephanie Smith bought a house from D. R. Horton, Inc., which included an arbitration clause and limited liability provisions. After discovering defects, the Smiths sued for various claims, but their motion to compel arbitration was denied because the contract's terms were found to be unconscionable.
:p Describe the Case in Point 15.16.
??x
In this case, Gregory and Stephanie Smith bought a house from D. R. Horton, Inc., which included an arbitration clause and limited liability provisions. After discovering defects, they sued for negligence, breach of contract, breach of warranty, and unfair trade practices. The court denied their motion to compel arbitration, finding that the arbitration clause was oppressive, unconscionable, and unenforceable.
x??

---
#### Unconscionability in Other Situations
While technically applying only to contracts for the sale of goods under Section 2-302 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), courts have expanded this concept to apply in other contexts. This broadening allows for more equitable treatment of weaker parties in various contractual relationships.
:p How has the concept of unconscionability been applied beyond UCC?
??x
While technically applying only to contracts for the sale of goods under Section 2-302 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), courts have expanded this concept to apply in other contexts. This broadening allows for more equitable treatment of weaker parties in various contractual relationships, ensuring that agreements are not unduly oppressive or one-sided.
x??

---

---
#### Adhesion Contracts
Adhesion contracts are standard-form contracts drafted by one party and offered on a take-it-or-leave-it basis to another, with little or no opportunity for negotiation. These contracts typically benefit the drafter while often placing significant burdens on the other party.

:p Can Ann rescind the deal based on Matt's misrepresentation?
??x
In this scenario, Ann cannot successfully rescind the deal based on fraudulent misrepresentation as defined in the context provided. Even though Ann has discovered that the quality of the wiring, fixtures, and appliances is not as stated by Matt, Matt did not act with scienter (with knowledge or intent to deceive). Matt's actions were more about trying to make a sale rather than actively attempting to defraud Ann.

The key point here is that fraud requires an intentional misrepresentation. Since Matt claims he was not trying to fool her and only wanted to make a sale, his lack of intent means there is no basis for rescinding the deal under fraudulent misrepresentation.
x??

---
#### Bilateral Mistake
A bilateral mistake occurs when both parties misunderstand a material fact about the contract. For this type of mistake to be relevant in invalidating or altering an agreement, it must affect the legal rights and obligations of the parties.

:p Can Elle be held liable to GCC based on the audit reports?
??x
Elle cannot be held liable to GCC for fraudulent misrepresentation as her actions do not meet the criteria. She believed that the audit reports were accurate and did not intend to deceive GCC, even though she did not check them thoroughly before certifying them.

For liability under fraudulent misrepresentation, Elle would need to have known or should have known the reports were false and intended to mislead GCC. Since Elle's actions reflect a negligent omission rather than an intentional deception, she is not liable for fraudulent misrepresentation.
x??

---
#### Duress
Duress involves one party compelling another to enter into a contract under threat of serious harm if they do not agree. Such contracts are generally voidable at the option of the coerced party.

:p Can Juan set aside his contract with Samuel?
??x
Juan can likely set aside this contract due to undue influence, which occurs when an individual uses pressure or power over another to enter into a contract under duress. In this case, Samuel is using his position as Juan’s primary caregiver and dependency on him for support to force the land transfer.

The fact that Juan is entirely dependent on Samuel's care and support, and that Samuel threatens to withdraw it unless the contract is entered into, constitutes undue influence. Therefore, Juan can set aside the contract due to this coercive situation.
x??

---
#### Innocent Misrepresentation
Innocent misrepresentation occurs when one party makes a false statement of fact believing it to be true but actually causing harm to the other party.

:p Can Simmons rescind the contract with Jenson?
??x
Simmons cannot rescind the contract based on innocent misrepresentation. The mistake in this scenario is about the value of the stone, not about any material facts that would have significantly affected the terms or obligations under the agreement. Since Simmons believed the stone to be quartz and Jenson held the same belief, there was no fraudulent or negligent act by either party.

The discovery of the stone being a diamond worth $1,000 is an unforeseen circumstance but does not constitute a mistake that would void or alter the contract.
x??

---
#### Latent Defects
Latent defects refer to hidden or undiscoverable flaws in property or goods that become apparent only after a reasonable time has passed from the sale.

:p Can Tanner get his funds back based on latent defects?
??x
Tanner might have a case for rescinding the contract based on latent defects, but it is not straightforward. The key issue lies in whether the bypass plan was known at the time of purchase and its impact on the motel's profitability.

If the planned bypass significantly affects the value or net income of the motel and this information was withheld by Grano, Tanner might have grounds for fraudulent misrepresentation. However, latent defects are typically related to hidden problems that arise after a reasonable period, not pre-existing conditions known only at the time of sale.

Tanner would need to demonstrate that the bypass is a material fact affecting the value of the motel and that this was concealed or misrepresented by Grano.
x??

---
#### Negligent Misrepresentation
Negligent misrepresentation occurs when one party makes a false statement of fact without intending to deceive but through carelessness, which causes harm to the other party.

:p Can Goldman be forced to pay Jacoby?
??x
Goldman can likely be held liable for paying Jacoby based on duress rather than negligent misrepresentation. The threat of criminal charges and legal action to coerce Goldman into agreeing to pay $5,000 constitutes a form of duress.

Duress involves coercion through the use of threats that induce fear or compulsion in another party. Here, Jacoby’s threat to involve law enforcement and bring criminal charges against Goldman if he does not agree to pay is sufficient grounds for setting aside the contract due to undue influence.
