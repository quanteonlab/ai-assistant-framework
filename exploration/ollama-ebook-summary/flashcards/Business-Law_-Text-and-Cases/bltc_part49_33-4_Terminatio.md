**Starting Chapter:** 33-4 Termination of an Agency

---

---
#### Agency Liability
Background context: This concept deals with a principal's responsibility for an agent’s actions, particularly violations of laws or regulations. The liability can extend to areas such as sanitation rules, price regulations, and liquor sale regulations.

:p What is agency liability?
??x
A principal may be held responsible for their agent’s violations of certain legal rules or regulations. For example, if an agent breaches sanitation codes, the principal could face penalties.
x??

---
#### Termination by Act of the Parties
Background context: The termination of an agency relationship can occur through specific acts agreed upon by both parties. These acts include lapsing time, achieving a purpose, occurrence of a specified event, mutual agreement, and unilateral decision.

:p What are the bases for terminating an agency by act of the parties?
??x
An agency may be terminated based on the lapse of time as stipulated in the contract, achievement of the agreed-upon purpose, occurrence of a specific event, mutual agreement between both parties, or at the discretion of one party. For example, if a six-month period is specified for an agency relationship, it automatically ends after that duration.
x??

---
#### Termination by Operation of Law
Background context: Agency relationships can also terminate due to legal reasons beyond the control of either the principal or agent.

:p Can you provide examples of termination by operation of law?
??x
An agency may terminate due to certain legal events such as bankruptcy, death, or revocation of a license. If Smart T rike, Ltd., goes bankrupt, their distribution agreement with Piermont Products would end.
x??

---
#### Revocation and Renunciation
Background context: The termination can be initiated by the principal (revocation) or agent (renunciation). Each action involves different legal implications.

:p How does revocation differ from renunciation?
??x
Revocation is when the principal terminates an agency relationship. For instance, if Wrongful Termination Company ends its contract with a real estate agent after six months, it's considered revocation. Renunciation occurs when an agent decides to cease their duties, such as a salesperson deciding to stop working for a company.
x??

---
#### Case in Point: Smart T rike, Ltd. and Piermont Products, LLC
Background context: This case illustrates the importance of proper notice periods in agency agreements. The contract required six months' notice.

:p What issue did Smart T rike, Ltd., face with Piermont Products, LLC?
??x
Smart T rike, Ltd., faced an issue regarding the termination notice period specified in their contract with Piermont Products, LLC. They were required to give six months’ notice, during which time they had to manage ongoing operations.
x??

---
#### Example of Agency Ending Automatically
Background context: The agency relationship can end automatically based on certain predefined events.

:p Can you provide an example where the agency ends automatically?
??x
An agency agreement between Wrongful Termination Company and real estate agent would terminate after six months, as specified in their contract. Similarly, Abe’s agency for Calvin to purchase breeding stock would cease upon completing the purchases.
x??

---
#### Reasonable Time Period
Background context: The duration of an agency relationship can be indefinite but should end within a reasonable time if no specific period is set.

:p What determines whether a time frame is "reasonable"?
??x
The determination of what constitutes a "reasonable" time depends on the circumstances and nature of the agency. Factors such as the complexity of tasks, industry standards, and contract terms would influence this judgment.
x??

---

---
#### Notice of Termination in Agency Relationships
When the parties terminate an agency, it is the principal’s duty to inform any third parties who know of the existence of the agency that it has been terminated. No particular form is required for notice of termination to be effective. The principal can personally notify the agent, or the agent can learn of the termination through some other means.

C/Java code is not directly applicable here, but we can provide a simple example in pseudocode:
```pseudocode
if (termination_notified_to_third_parties) {
    // Notify all relevant third parties
}
```
:p What is the principal's duty when terminating an agency relationship?
??x
The principal has the duty to inform any third parties who know of the existence of the agency that it has been terminated. This can be done through personal notification or other means, and no specific form is required.
x??
---

---
#### Apparent Authority Continues Until Notice Received
An agent's actual authority ends when the agency is terminated; however, an agent’s apparent authority continues until the third party receives notice (from any source) that such authority has been terminated.

:p What happens to an agent's apparent authority after the termination of an agency?
??x
An agent’s apparent authority continues until the third party receives notice from any source that the authority has been terminated.
x??
---

---
#### Direct vs. Constructive Notice for Third Parties
If the principal knows that a third party has dealt with the agent, the principal is expected to notify that person directly. For third parties who have heard about the agency but have not yet dealt with the agent, constructive notice is sufficient.

:p How should a principal notify third parties that have dealt with an agent?
??x
The principal should notify third parties that have dealt with the agent directly.
x??
---

---
#### Writing and Revocation of Authority
If the agent’s authority is written, it must be revoked in writing (unless the written document contains an expiration date).

:p What action is required to revoke an agent's authority if it was granted through a written agreement?
??x
To revoke an agent's authority if it was granted through a written agreement, it must be done in writing.
x??
---

---
#### Termination by Operation of Law: Death or Insanity
The general rule is that the death or insanity of either the principal or the agent automatically and immediately terminates an ordinary agency relationship. Knowledge of the death or insanity is not required.

:p What events automatically terminate an agency relationship under operation of law?
??x
The death or insanity of either the principal or the agent automatically and immediately terminates an ordinary agency relationship.
x??
---

---
#### Termination by Operation of Law: Impossibility
When the specific subject matter of an agency is destroyed or lost, the agency terminates. Similarly, when it is impossible for the agent to perform the agency lawfully because of a change in the law, the agency also terminates.

:p How does the destruction or loss of the specific subject matter of an agency affect its termination?
??x
The destruction or loss of the specific subject matter of an agency automatically terminates the agency.

#### Respondeat Superior Doctrine
Respondeat superior is a legal doctrine that holds an employer liable for the torts committed by its employees within the scope of their employment. This doctrine applies when an employee, while performing tasks assigned or authorized by the employer, commits a wrongful act causing harm to another party.
:p Under what doctrine discussed in this chapter might Buy-Mart be held liable for the tort committed by Watts?
??x
Buy-Mart could potentially be held liable under the respondeat superior doctrine. This means that if Watts's actions were within the scope of her employment and she was acting on behalf of Buy-Mart, Buy-Mart would be responsible for any torts she committed.
```java
// Example scenario in Java:
public class EmployeeResponsibility {
    public void checkEmployerLiability(Employee employee, String action) {
        // Check if the action is within the scope of employment
        boolean inScope = employee.isWithinScopeOfEmployment(action);
        if (inScope && employee.commitTort()) {
            System.out.println("Buy-Mart might be held liable for Watts's actions.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Buy-Mart would not be held liable.");
        }
    }
}
```
x??

---
#### Key Factor in Determining Respondeat Superior Liability
The key factor in determining whether Buy-Mart is liable under the respondeat superior doctrine is whether Watts’s behavior constituted an intentional tort or a tort of negligence. The nature and intent behind the actions will influence how the liability is assessed.
:p What is the key factor in determining whether Buy-Mart is liable under this doctrine?
??x
The key factor in determining whether Buy-Mart is liable under the respondeat superior doctrine is the nature and intent behind Watts's actions. If Watts committed an intentional tort, such as assault or battery, or a negligent act that resulted in harm, Buy-Mart may be held responsible for these actions.
```java
// Example scenario in Java:
public class TortLiability {
    public void determineEmployerResponsibility(String action, boolean intent) {
        if (intent && action.equals("assault")) {
            System.out.println("Buy-Mart would likely be held liable due to respondeat superior.");
        } else if (!intent && action.equals("negligent act")) {
            System.out.println("Buy-Mart might still be held liable for negligent acts within the scope of employment.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Buy-Mart would not be held liable for this specific action.");
        }
    }
}
```
x??

---
#### Effect of Previous Convictions on Liability
If Watts disclosed in her application that she had previously been convicted of felony assault and battery, but Buy-Mart still hired her as a cashier, this information could affect the company's liability. It might indicate a pattern or negligence in hiring practices, which could be relevant to the court’s assessment of liability.
:p How might the fact that Watts disclosed previous convictions affect Buy-Mart’s potential liability?
??x
The fact that Watts disclosed previous convictions for felony assault and battery but was still hired by Buy-Mart as a cashier could potentially influence the company's liability. While disclosure does not necessarily absolve the employer, it may be considered in evaluating whether the company exercised reasonable care in hiring practices. If Buy-Mart failed to adequately assess the risk posed by Watts’s history, this omission might be used against them in court.
```java
// Example scenario in Java:
public class HiringPractices {
    public void evaluateEmployerResponsibility(boolean disclosedConvictions, boolean adequateRiskAssessment) {
        if (!disclosedConvictions && !adequateRiskAssessment) {
            System.out.println("Buy-Mart would likely be held fully liable for Watts's actions.");
        } else if (disclosedConvictions && !adequateRiskAssessment) {
            System.out.println("Buy-Mart might still face partial liability due to inadequate risk assessment.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Buy-Mart’s potential liability is minimized given the disclosed convictions.");
        }
    }
}
```

#### Liability for Contractual Breach
In the first issue spotter, Davis contracts with Estee to buy a certain horse on her behalf. Estee does not pay the rest of the price, and Farmland Stables sues Davis for breach of contract. Davis can hold Estee liable if she had actual or apparent authority over the transaction.
:p Can Davis hold Estee liable for what-ever damages he has to pay?
??x
Yes, Davis can hold Estee liable for whatever damages he has to pay under certain circumstances. If Estee gave Davis actual or apparent authority to make the deal and Davis acted within that authority, Estee would be jointly liable with Davis.
```java
// Example scenario in Java:
public class LiabilityForContracts {
    public void determineLiability(boolean actualOrApparentAuthority) {
        if (actualOrApparentAuthority) {
            System.out.println("Estee can be held jointly liable for the damages.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Davis would have to bear the liability alone.");
        }
    }
}
```

#### Agent's Authority and Liability for Contracts

Basic Research, LLC advertised its products through Rainbow Media Holdings, Inc., using Icebox Advertising, Inc. as an agent with express authority to buy ads with cash in advance but no authority to make purchases on credit.

:p Can Rainbow Media Holdings, Inc., recoup the unpaid amounts from Basic Research, LLC?
??x
Rainbow Media Holdings, Inc., cannot directly recoup the unpaid amounts from Basic Research, LLC, because Icebox Advertising, Inc. acted beyond its express authority by purchasing ads on credit without Rainbow's consent. While Basic did pay Icebox for the services rendered, the transaction with Rainbow was unauthorized and thus unenforceable.

This situation highlights the importance of adhering to the scope of an agent’s authority. If Icebox had obtained Rainbow’s explicit consent to make purchases on credit, then Rainbow could have potentially pursued payment from Basic Research, LLC. However, since the transaction was unauthorized, Basic is not liable for payments made by Icebox outside its express authority.

#### Scope of Agent's Authority

Susan, as Rosie’s primary caregiver and agent under a durable power of attorney, opened a joint bank account with $9,643.62 and used some of the money to pay household expenses.

:p What general duty did Susan owe Rosie as her agent?
??x
As an agent acting under a durable power of attorney, Susan owed Rosie several duties, including the duty of care, loyalty, and accounting. The duty of care required Susan to act in Rosie’s best interests. The duty of loyalty obligated Susan to avoid conflicts of interest and not misuse her position for personal gain. Lastly, the duty of accounting required Susan to provide an accurate accounting of all transactions related to Rosie's funds.

These duties are critical because they ensure that agents act responsibly and transparently when managing another person's assets.

#### Scope of Agent's Authority

Lorene Jones was admitted to Whitesburg Gardens after her daughter, Yvonne Barbour, signed the admission forms as her representative. The forms included an "Alternative Dispute Resolution Agreement" for binding arbitration.

:p Can Jones be compelled to submit her claim to arbitration?
??x
Yes, Jones can be compelled to submit her claim to arbitration based on the Alternative Dispute Resolution Agreement (ADRA) she signed through her daughter, Yvonne Barbour. The ADRA stipulates that any disputes between "the Resident" and "the Facility" must be resolved by binding arbitration.

The key issue here is whether Jones ratified the ADRA when she was admitted to Whitesburg Gardens. Since Jones did not object during the admission process, it can be inferred that she implicitly consented to the terms of the agreement. Therefore, the arbitration clause in the ADRA likely binds her and must be honored.

#### Agent's Authority

Devin Fink, manager at Precision Tune Auto Care, filled out a service order for Randall Stywall’s car with an estimate of the cost.

:p What does this scenario illustrate about agent's authority?
??x
This scenario illustrates that an agent can act within their explicit or implied authority to bind their principal. In this case, Devin Fink, as Precision Tune Auto Care's manager (an agent), filled out a service order for Randall Stywall’s car with an estimate of the cost. This action is likely within his authority if he has been delegated such responsibilities.

The key takeaway is that agents must act within the scope of their authority to bind the principal. If Fink had acted outside his authority, any subsequent claims or disputes could challenge the validity of his actions and potentially harm Precision Tune Auto Care's standing.

#### Employment at Will Doctrine
Background context explaining the employment-at-will doctrine. This doctrine allows either party to terminate an employment relationship at any time and for any reason, unless it violates statutory or contractual rights.

The majority of U.S. workers continue to have the legal status of “employees at will,” meaning this common law doctrine is still widely used. Only one state (Montana) does not apply it.
:p What is the employment-at-will doctrine?
??x
The employment-at-will doctrine allows either party to terminate an employment relationship at any time and for any reason, unless it violates statutory or contractual rights.

This means that employers can fire employees without providing specific reasons, and employees can quit their jobs with minimal notice. However, certain federal and state statutes restrict this doctrine.
x??

---
#### Common Law Exceptions
Background context explaining common law exceptions to the employment-at-will doctrine. These exceptions are based on contract theory, tort theory, and public policy.

Some courts have held that an implied employment contract exists between the employer and the employee, allowing the employee to succeed in a breach of contract action if they are fired outside the terms of this implied contract.
:p What is one type of common law exception discussed?
??x
One type of common law exception is based on contract theory. This involves courts finding an implied employment contract that exists between the employer and the employee, allowing the employee to succeed in a breach of contract action if they are fired outside the terms of this implied contract.
x??

---
#### Implied Employment Contract Example
Background context explaining the example provided involving BDI Enterprises.

BDI Enterprises’ employment manual and personnel bulletin both state that workers will be dismissed only for good cause. If an employee reasonably expects the employer to follow this policy, a court may find there is an implied employment contract.
:p What does the case of Julie Chin illustrate?
??x
The case of Julie Chin illustrates how courts can find an implied employment contract when an employer's policies and practices create reasonable expectations among employees.

If Julie Chin at BDI reasonably expects that workers will only be dismissed for good cause, a court may find that there is an implied contract that she should not be fired without good cause.
x??

#### Federal Statutes Preventing Discrimination
Background context explaining federal statutes preventing discrimination in employment relationships. 

Federal and state statutes govern workplace practices to prevent discriminatory firing. For example, firing an employee for reasons such as race, gender, or age is prohibited by laws like the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
:p What does federal law prevent regarding employment?
??x
Federal law prevents discrimination in employment based on factors such as race, gender, and age.

For example, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employers from firing employees due to their protected characteristics. This means that an employer cannot fire an employee because they are a certain race or gender.

#### Gary Randall's Situation
Background context explaining Gary Randall’s situation in Valley Manor.

Gary Randall works as an activities director for Valley Manor, where he hires and supervises other employees. One day, while accompanying residents on an excursion to a local art museum, he falls down cement stairs and breaks his pelvis.
:p What workplace scenario is described?
??x
The scenario describes Gary Randall’s situation at Valley Manor, where he works as an activities director. On a specific occasion, while supervising an outing with residents, he sustains a serious injury.

This incident highlights the distinction between employee status and independent contractor status in employment law.
