**Starting Chapter:** 47-2 Potential Liability to Third Parties

---

#### Actual Fraud
Background context: An accountant or other professional may be held liable for actual fraud when they intentionally misstate a material fact to mislead a client, and the client is injured as a result of justifiably relying on the misstated fact. A material fact is one that a reasonable person would consider important in making decisions.
:p What are the elements required for an accountant or professional to be held liable for actual fraud?
??x
An accountant or professional can be held liable for actual fraud if:
1. They intentionally misstate a material fact.
2. The client relies on this misstated fact justifiably and suffers injury as a result.
3. A reasonable person would consider the misstated fact important in making decisions.

Example: If an accountant knowingly provides false financial statements, and the client makes a business decision based on these statements resulting in loss, the accountant may be held liable for actual fraud.

#### Constructive Fraud
Background context: Constructive fraud can occur when a professional is grossly negligent in performing their duties. Unlike actual fraud, constructive fraud does not require the intent to deceive but involves a failure to perform due diligence with reckless disregard of potential consequences.
:p Can you explain the difference between actual and constructive fraud?
??x
Actual Fraud requires:
- Intentional misstatement
- Client injury due to reliance on the misstated fact

Constructive Fraud involves:
- Gross negligence in performing duties
- Reckless disregard for potential consequences without intent to deceive.

Example: An accountant who accepts explanations from a client regarding financial irregularities, despite contradictory evidence, could be considered constructively fraudulent.

#### Third Party Liability of Auditors
Background context: Traditionally, professionals like accountants owed a duty only to those with whom they had a direct contractual relationship. However, today many courts have expanded this duty to include third parties such as investors, shareholders, creditors, corporate managers, and regulatory agencies who rely on the auditor's opinions.
:p Why have courts abandoned the privity requirement in regard to auditors' liability to third parties?
??x
Courts have expanded the duty of accountants to third parties due to extensive reliance by these stakeholders. Traditionally, the rule was that an accountant owed a duty only to their direct client (privity of contract). However, with third parties relying heavily on auditor opinions for decision-making, courts now hold auditors liable to these third parties even without privity.

Example: When ComCo, Inc., experiences financial difficulties, shareholders and creditors might sue the independent auditor for negligence in conducting the audit.

#### The Ultramares Rule
Background context: This traditional rule was established by Chief Judge Benjamin Cardozo in 1931. It stated that an accountant owed a duty only to their direct client and not to third parties, except in cases of fraud or other intentional wrongdoing.

:p What is the significance of the Ultramares case?
??x
The Ultramares case is significant because it established the traditional rule that accountants were liable only to their direct clients (privity of contract). This rule limited liability to those with whom there was a direct contractual relationship, such as the accountant's client.

```java
// Example code for understanding the concept in Java context
public class AuditorLiability {
    public void auditClient(Client c) {
        // Code to perform an audit on the client
        if (c.isFraudulent()) {
            throw new AuditException("Client engaged in fraudulent activity");
        }
    }
}
```

#### Ultramares Rule and Near Privity
Background context explaining the concept. The Ultramares rule, established by the court decision *Ultramares Corp. v. Touche* (1931), sets a high standard for third parties to sue an accountant based on the "privity of contract" requirement. In the case *Credit Alliance Corp. v. Krouse, Kern & Co.* (7th Cir., 1987) and other rulings, courts have started to relax this strict requirement by adopting what is known as the "near privity" rule.

The near privity rule allows third parties to sue an accountant for negligence if they have a sufficiently close relationship or nexus with the accountant. This rule has been adopted in minority states but represents a significant shift from the Ultramares standard.

:p What does the near privity rule allow third parties to do?
??x
The near privity rule allows third parties to sue an accountant for negligence even if they are not direct clients, provided they have a sufficiently close relationship or nexus with the accountant. This rule has been adopted in minority states and is often referred to as the "Credit Alliance" rule.

#### Restatement (Third) of Torts
Background context explaining the concept. The Ultramares rule has faced criticism for its strict interpretation, particularly regarding auditors' liability to third parties. In response, the American Law Institute developed the Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liability for Physical and Emotional Harm (1998), which broadens the scope of an accountant's duty beyond their direct clients.

The Restatement rule states that accountants are liable not only to their clients but also to foreseeable users of their reports or financial statements. This approach aims to provide more fairness by ensuring that users who rely on the information have a legal remedy if it is negligently prepared.

:p According to the Restatement (Third) of Torts, for whom can an accountant be held liable?
??x
According to the Restatement (Third) of Torts, an accountant can be held liable to:
1. Persons for whose benefit and guidance the accountant intends to supply information or knows that the recipient intends to supply it.
2. Persons whom the accountant intends the information to influence or knows that the recipient so intends.

In simpler terms, accountants are responsible not only to their clients but also to any third parties who can be reasonably foreseen as relying on their work.

#### Reasonably Foreseeable Users Rule
Background context explaining the concept. A small minority of courts have adopted a different approach by holding accountants liable for any users whose reliance on an accountant’s statements or reports was reasonably foreseeable. This rule is often criticized for potentially exposing accountants to extensive liability because it does not limit the scope based on the direct intent to supply information.

The majority of courts, however, prefer the Restatement (Third) of Torts approach as it provides more predictability and control over potential liabilities by focusing on the accountant's specific knowledge at the time of publication.

:p According to some courts, for whom can an accountant be held liable?
??x
According to a small minority of courts, accountants can be held liable for any users whose reliance on their statements or reports was reasonably foreseeable. This rule extends the scope of liability beyond direct clients and is often criticized for potentially imposing significant risks.

#### Example Application: Accountant's Liability
Background context explaining the concept. The example provided illustrates how an accountant’s negligence can extend to third parties who are not direct clients but whose reliance on the financial statements prepared by the accountant was foreseeable.

In the case of Steve, an accountant preparing a financial statement for Tech Software, Inc., knowing that it would be submitted when applying for a loan from First National Bank, the bank could hold Steve liable if the statement included negligent misstatements or omissions since he knew the bank would rely on his work.

:p In the given example, who can be held liable for negligence?
??x
In the given example, Steve (the accountant) can be held liable for negligence because First National Bank relied on the financial statements prepared by Steve, knowing that Tech Software, Inc. intended to use these statements when applying for a loan.

#### Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB)
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act established the PCAOB to oversee public accounting firms and ensure compliance with its provisions. The board reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and oversees the audit of public companies subject to securities laws, aiming to protect public investors.

:p What is the purpose of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB)?

#### Legal Duty of Lawyers in Wrongful Death Claims

In Nebraska, a lawyer’s duty is generally limited to their client but can extend to third parties under certain circumstances. The court ruled that in this case, a lawyer named Stern owed an independent legal duty to Martinez’s minor children as direct and intended beneficiaries.

:p Did the court find that lawyers owe a general duty to clients only or does it extend to third parties?
??x
Lawyers generally owe their clients a duty of reasonable care and skill. However, in this case, the court ruled that Stern owed an independent legal duty to Martinez’s minor children as direct and intended beneficiaries of her services.

Courts have established that a lawyer's duty extends to third parties when they are direct and intended beneficiaries of the attorney's services. In this case, the court determined that Stern owed a duty to Martinez’s minor children to represent their interests competently.

:p What does the court consider as establishing an independent legal duty in wrongful death actions?
