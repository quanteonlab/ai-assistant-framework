**Starting Chapter:** 43-3 The Administrative Process

---

#### Administrative Process Overview
The APA (Administrative Procedure Act) outlines specific procedural requirements for federal agencies to follow when fulfilling their rulemaking, enforcement, and adjudication functions. These procedures ensure transparency and public participation.
:p What is the administrative process?
??x
The administrative process refers to the three primary functions of federal agencies: rulemaking, enforcement, and adjudication. The APA provides procedural guidelines that agencies must adhere to for these activities, ensuring transparency and public involvement.
x??

---

#### Rulemaking Function
Rulemaking involves the creation or amendment of regulations by an agency. Rules are defined as statements with general or particular applicability designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law and policy. Like statutes, rules can have legal binding force, subjecting violators to penalties.
:p What is rulemaking?
??x
Rulemaking is the process where federal agencies develop new regulations or amend existing ones to implement, interpret, or prescribe law and policy. Rules can enforce compliance similar to statutes, and violators might face penalties.
x??

---

#### APA’s Role in Rulemaking
The APA sets procedural requirements for creating, amending, or removing rules. Notable procedures include notice-and-comment rulemaking, which involves three steps: (1) Notice of the proposed rulemaking, (2) a comment period, and (3) the final rule.
:p What does the APA require agencies to follow in rulemaking?
??x
The APA requires federal agencies to follow specific procedural guidelines when creating or amending rules. One key procedure is notice-and-comment rulemaking, which includes publishing a notice, allowing public comments, and issuing the final rule.
x??

---

#### Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
When an agency decides to create a new rule, it publishes a notice in the Federal Register, specifying where and when proceedings will be held, the legal authority for making the rule, and details about the proposed rule. This process also requires making certain scientific data publicly available.
:p What is the purpose of publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking?
??x
The purpose of publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking is to inform the public about upcoming regulatory changes. It includes information on where and when proceedings will take place, the legal authority for the rules, and details relevant to the proposal, ensuring transparency.
x??

---

#### Comment Period Process
Following the publication of the notice, agencies must allow a sufficient time period for interested parties to submit written comments. These comments can influence agency policy and become part of the public record.
:p What is the comment period?
??x
The comment period allows interested parties, including members of the public, industry representatives, or advocacy groups, to provide written feedback on proposed rules. This input can significantly impact final rulemaking decisions and forms a part of the official public record.
x??

---

#### Exceptions to APA Procedural Requirements
While the APA sets strict procedural requirements for agencies, some exceptions are recognized. However, these exceptions are rarely invoked due to their limited nature.
:p Are there any exceptions to the APA’s procedural requirements?
??x
Yes, there are exceptions to the APA's procedural requirements. These exceptions exist but are seldom used because they are typically only applicable in very specific circumstances.
x??

---

#### Impetus for Rulemaking
Rulemaking can be initiated by various sources such as Congress or the agency itself. Private parties can also petition an agency to begin rulemaking or repeal a rule, with examples like environmental groups seeking stricter air-pollution controls.
:p What initiates rulemaking?
??x
Rulemaking can be initiated by several sources: 
- Congress through legislative action
- The agency itself based on its mission and authority
- Private parties through petitions requesting new rules or the repeal of existing ones. For instance, environmental groups might petition for stricter air-pollution controls.
x??

---

---
#### Guidance Documents and Informal Agency Actions
Background context explaining that guidance documents advise the public on agencies' legal and policy positions. Informal agency actions are exempt from the APA's requirements because they do not establish legal rights, and a party cannot be directly prosecuted for violating an interpretive rule or a guidance document.

Informal actions can be significant as they may warn regulated entities about potential future formal rulemaking if ignored.
:p What is the significance of informal agency actions in relation to guidance documents?
??x
Informal agency actions are important because they serve as warnings to regulated entities. They may signal that an agency might engage in formal rulemaking if certain practices continue or are not corrected. This can influence compliance and set a precedent for future regulations.
x??

---
#### Rule Enforcement
Background context explaining that while rulemaking is the most prominent activity, enforcement is equally critical. Agencies often enforce their own rules by conducting investigations to monitor compliance with the rule or the terms of the enabling statute.

An investigation might begin when an agency receives a report of a possible violation or through compliance reporting from regulated entities.
:p What triggers an agency investigation in enforcing its rules?
??x
An agency investigation can be triggered by receiving a report of a possible violation or through compliance reports submitted by regulated entities. The agency may also initiate investigations on their own initiative to ensure compliance with the rules and statutes they enforce.
x??

---
#### Inspections and Tests
Background context explaining that inspections are often necessary for obtaining evidence needed to prove regulatory violations, and sometimes serve as alternatives to formal hearings.

Inspections can range widely from safety checks of mines to environmental monitoring, and may involve requesting specific documents or records from firms.
:p What methods do agencies use in conducting investigations?
??x
Agencies use on-site inspections to gather information. These inspections are crucial for obtaining evidence needed to prove regulatory violations. They might also request specific documents or records from firms for examination as part of an investigation.

Example: 
```java
public class Inspection {
    public void performInspection(String facility) {
        // Code to perform safety checks, environmental monitoring, etc.
        System.out.println("Inspecting " + facility);
    }
    
    public void requestDocuments() {
        // Code to request and examine documents
        System.out.println("Requesting relevant documents for examination.");
    }
}
```
x??

---
#### Subpoenas
Background context explaining the two types of subpoenas: subpoena ad testificandum (to testify) and subpoena duces tecum (bring it with you). These are used to compel witnesses or individuals to provide testimony or documents respectively.

An agency may use these to obtain evidence during an investigation, but courts can determine if an abuse of discretion has occurred by considering factors like the legitimacy of the purpose.
:p What are the two types of subpoenas and their purposes?
??x
There are two types of subpoenas: subpoena ad testificandum ("to testify") and subpoena duces tecum ("bring it with you").

- Subpoena ad testificandum compels a witness to appear at an agency hearing.
- Subpoena duces tecum compels an individual or organization to hand over books, papers, records, or documents.

These are used to gather testimony or documents during investigations. Courts can determine if the agency's use of these subpoenas is an abuse of discretion by considering factors like the legitimacy of the purpose and whether the request is unreasonable.
x??

#### Government Regulation Background
Background context explaining the regulatory framework for marijuana research. The National Center for Natural Products Research at the University of Mississippi is the sole registered entity to manufacture marijuana for research purposes, under a contract administered by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), which is part of the NIH and HHS.
:p What are the key points about government regulation of marijuana in research as described in the text?
??x
The key points include:
- Since 1968, the University of Mississippi has been registered to grow marijuana for research purposes through a contract with NIDA.
- This contract is administered by NIDA and renewed every five years.
- The NCNPR is the only entity that can manufacture marijuana under federal law.
- The current regime faces challenges regarding competition but is deemed adequate based on supply levels and existing provisions.
??x
---

#### Competition Argument
Explanation of Dr. Craker's argument about inadequate competitive conditions due to a single manufacturer of marijuana. The Administrator rebutted this by highlighting the cost-free or low-cost provision of marijuana from NIDA and Dr. Craker’s ability to bid for the contract when it renews.
:p How did the court address Dr. Craker's competition argument?
??x
The court noted that while there is only one manufacturer, Dr. Craker could still compete by bidding on the contract renewal. The Administrator argued that "adequately competitive conditions" under the CSA are not as narrow as Dr. Craker suggested and that the current supply of marijuana exceeds research demands.
??x
---

#### Supply Adequacy Argument
Explanation of Dr. Craker’s claim about supply adequacy, including the Administrator's response regarding existing supplies in NIDA's possession and FDA-approved projects.
:p How did the court evaluate Dr. Craker's argument on supply adequacy?
??x
The court found that over 1,000 kilograms of marijuana were available to researchers through NIDA, which is more than 90 times what Dr. Craker proposed supplying. The Administrator noted that even if certain projects were rejected by NIDA, this does not undermine the substantial evidence supporting the adequacy of supply.
??x
---

#### Finality of Agency Orders
Explanation on why courts typically wait for agency orders to go through the entire procedural process before reviewing them, emphasizing the importance of administrative decision-making and judicial deference.
:p Why should a court wait until an agency order is final before reviewing it?
??x
Courts typically review agency decisions only after they have been fully implemented because this allows for the full administrative process to play out. This ensures that all procedural steps are followed, providing both parties with ample opportunity to present their arguments and evidence.
??x

#### Background on Petitioner's Case
Petitioner, a man named Olivares, had submitted a training request to FlightSafety International—Paris Learning Center. His case involved several legal and security issues that ultimately led TSA (Transportation Security Administration) to deny his training request.

:p What are the key points in the background of this case?
??x
The key points include:
- Petitioner submitted a training request.
- He pled guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute controlled substances in 2007, leading to an 80-month sentence and making him inadmissible to the U.S.
- His FAA Airman’s Certificate was revoked due to his conviction.
- He was deported to Venezuela in March 2010.
- After deportation, a public news article provided his U.S. address.
- There were concerns about his involvement in firearms trafficking and criminal activities involving private aircraft.

TSA denied the training request based on these factors.
x??

---

#### TSA's Jurisdiction
According to the text, actions taken by TSA on behalf of the Secretary of Homeland Security are subject to judicial review.

:p How does TSA’s jurisdiction affect this case?
??x
TSA has jurisdiction over civil aviation security and is responsible for balancing convenience with security. In cases involving potential threats to national security, courts must defer to TSA's expert judgments.
```java
// Example: Code snippet not directly related but illustrating the legal context
public class TSAJudicialReview {
    public void evaluateDecision() {
        // Assume this method evaluates decisions made by TSA based on provided evidence and regulations
        if (TSA.hasJurisdiction()) {
            // Implement logic to review TSA's decision within its jurisdiction
        }
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Standard of Review under Administrative Procedure Act
The Administrative Procedure Act requires courts to uphold TSA’s decisions unless they are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or not in accordance with the law.

:p What does the standard of review imply for this case?
??x
The standard implies that courts must defer to TSA's expert judgments regarding potential risks to national security. The court will only overturn a decision if it is clearly unreasonable or lacks legal basis.
```java
// Example: Pseudocode for applying the standard of review
if (TSA.decisionIsArbitraryOrCapricious() || !TSA.isInAccordanceWithLaw()) {
    // Court would likely not uphold TSA's decision
} else {
    // Uphold TSA's decision as reasonable and in accordance with law
}
```
x??

---

#### Petitioner's Arguments Against Denial
Petitioner argues that TSA should not have used his suspected firearms trafficking or Massachusetts address to support its decision. He claims the address is actually his brother’s, and he has never illegally entered the U.S.

:p What are Petitioner's main arguments?
??x
Petitioner argues:
- The Massachusetts address belongs to his brother.
- He has never illegally entered the United States.
These points challenge TSA's reasoning for denying his training request based on the provided evidence.

```java
// Example: Pseudocode representing Petitioner's argument
public class PetitionersArguments {
    public boolean addressBelongsToBrother() {
        return true; // For illustration purposes, assume this is true
    }

    public boolean enteredUSIllegally() {
        return false; // For illustration purposes, assume this is false
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### TSA's Considerations for Denial
TSA concluded that Petitioner posed a threat to aviation and national security due to his criminal history, involvement in firearms trafficking, and previous use of aircraft for illegal activities.

:p What factors led to TSA’s decision?
??x
TSA considered the following factors:
- Petitioner's conviction for drug possession.
- His revoked FAA Airman’s Certificate.
- The publication of a U.S. address after deportation.
- Suspected involvement in firearms trafficking and previous criminal activity with aircraft.
```java
// Example: Pseudocode representing TSA's decision-making process
public class TsaDecision {
    public boolean posesThreat() {
        if (hasConviction || isInvolvedInFirearmsTrafficking) {
            return true;
        }
        return false; // Simplified example logic
    }

    private boolean hasConviction = true; // Assume Petitioner has a conviction
    private boolean isInvolvedInFirearmsTrafficking = true; // Assume involvement in firearms trafficking
}
```

#### Congress's Review of New Federal Regulations
Congress may review new federal regulations for at least sixty days before they take effect, giving opponents of the rules time to present their arguments. This provision is designed to ensure that stakeholders have a chance to voice concerns and suggest improvements.

:p What does this passage explain about how Congress reviews new federal regulations?
??x
This passage explains that Congress has a 60-day period to review new federal regulations before they can take effect. During this time, opponents of the rules are given an opportunity to present their arguments and concerns, which allows for potential amendments or adjustments.

```java
// Example code might demonstrate how stakeholders could submit comments
public class CommentSubmission {
    public void sendComment(String regulationName, String comment) {
        System.out.println("Comment submitted: " + comment);
    }
}
```
x??
---

#### Courts Enforcing the Regulatory Flexibility Act
The courts may enforce the Regulatory Flexibility Act. This provision helps ensure that federal agencies consider ways to reduce the economic impact of new regulations on small businesses.

:p How do courts enforce the Regulatory Flexibility Act according to this passage?
??x
Courts can enforce the Regulatory Flexibility Act by ensuring that federal agencies take into account the potential economic impact on small businesses when implementing new regulations. This involves checking whether agencies have properly considered and addressed the effects on small businesses during the rulemaking process.

```java
// Pseudocode for a method to check if an agency has considered small business impacts
public class RegulatoryFlexibilityCheck {
    public boolean isSmallBusinessImpactConsidered(String[] considerations) {
        // Check if "small business impact" is in the list of considerations
        return Arrays.asList(considerations).contains("small business impact");
    }
}
```
x??

#### Office of the National Ombudsman at SBA
The Office of the National Ombudsman at the Small Business Administration (SBA) was set up to receive comments from small businesses about their dealings with federal agencies. Based on these comments, Regional Small Business Fairness Boards rate the agencies and publicize their findings.

:p What is the role of the Office of the National Ombudsman at SBA?
??x
The Office of the National Ombudsman at the SBA receives comments from small businesses regarding their interactions with federal agencies. These comments are then used by Regional Small Business Fairness Boards to rate the agencies and publicize their findings, ensuring transparency and accountability in how agencies interact with small businesses.

```java
// Pseudocode for a method that handles Ombudsman's role
public class OmbudsmanRole {
    public void handleComments(String[] comments) {
        // Process comments and forward them to the appropriate board
        System.out.println("Processing " + comments.length + " comments.");
    }
}
```
x??

#### SEC Rule Enforcement on Insider Trading

**Administrative Agencies**
- The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is an independent regulatory agency. Whether it matters in this dispute depends on specific legal contexts.
- **Public Comment Procedure**: A stockbrokerage firm objects that the new rule was unlawfully developed without opportunity for public comment.

:p Is the SEC an executive agency or an independent regulatory agency? Does it matter to the outcome of this dispute?
??x
The SEC is an independent regulatory agency. Whether this matters depends on specific legal contexts, such as procedural requirements and the nature of the rule change. In this case, the firm's objection focuses on the lack of public comment, which is a procedural issue more relevant when dealing with formal rules.

```java
// Pseudocode for handling SEC actions
public class SECActions {
    public void checkProceduralRequirements(String actionType) {
        if (actionType.equals("formal rulemaking")) {
            System.out.println("Public comment required.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Other procedures apply.");
        }
    }
}
```
x??
---

#### SEC Rule Change and APA

**Administrative Procedure Act (APA)**
- The SEC asserts that it has always had the statutory authority to pursue persons for insider trading regardless of personal profit.
- **Arbitrary and Capricious Standard**: This is the only argument. A court might find this action arbitrary if there's no clear justification.

:p Would a court be likely to find that the SEC’s action was arbitrary and capricious under the APA?
??x
A court would likely scrutinize whether the SEC has provided sufficient rationale for changing its enforcement rules from targeting insiders who profit personally, to pursuing all insider trading cases. If the SEC can only rely on historical authority without clear justification or new statutory basis, a court might find the action arbitrary and capricious.

```java
// Pseudocode for APA review process
public class APAProceduralReview {
    public boolean isActionArbitraryAndCapricious(String rationale) {
        if (rationale.isEmpty()) {
            return true;
        } else {
            // Check for clear justification in the rationale
            return false;
        }
    }
}
```
x??
---

#### Chevron Deference

**Chevron Deference**
- If a court finds that the new rule is merely "interpretive," the SEC would not be required to follow APA’s formal rulemaking procedures.

:p Would a court likely give Chevron deference to the SEC’s interpretation of the law on insider trading?
??x
If a court determines that the new rule is merely interpretive, it would not apply Chevron deference. Instead, the court would review the rule for reasonableness without deferring to the agency's interpretation. The SEC would then be required to follow formal rulemaking procedures if challenged.

```java
// Pseudocode for determining Chevron applicability
public class ChevronDeferenceCheck {
    public boolean isChevronApplicable(String ruleType) {
        return !ruleType.equals("interpretive");
    }
}
```
x??
---

#### ALJ in Administrative Hearings

**Administrative Law Judge (ALJ)**
- An administrative law judge (ALJ) acts as both a judge and jury. For fairness, there should always be at least three ALJs in each administrative hearing.

:p What safeguards promote the ALJ's fairness when an ALJ works for the DOT?
??x
To ensure fairness, several safeguards are typically implemented:
1. **Separation of Duties**: The ALJ is not involved in any prior decision-making processes related to the case.
2. **Judicial Independence**: The ALJ operates independently and impartially.
3. **Panel Structure**: For critical cases, having at least three ALJs (as mentioned) can provide a more balanced judgment.

```java
// Pseudocode for ensuring ALJ fairness in administrative hearings
public class ALJFairness {
    public void ensureFairness(int numberOfALJs, String[] caseDetails) {
        if (numberOfALJs < 3) {
            System.out.println("Not enough ALJs for fair hearing.");
        } else {
            // Proceed with the hearing
            System.out.println("Ensuring fairness in the hearing process.");
        }
    }
}
```
x??
---

#### Clean Air Act and EPA Authority
Background context: Under the Clean Air Act (CAA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is authorized to regulate "any" air pollutants emitted into the ambient air if such pollution causes or contributes to air pollution. A group of private organizations petitioned the EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles, but the EPA denied this request.
:p Did the EPA have the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles under the Clean Air Act?
??x
The EPA had the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles. The CAA broadly authorizes the EPA to regulate any air pollutants that contribute to air pollution, and carbon dioxide is recognized as a greenhouse gas capable of contributing to air pollution.
The EPA's denial was based on its interpretation of recent amendments to the CAA, which were not deemed to authorize new binding auto emissions limits. However, judicial review in Commonwealth of Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency (2007) found that the EPA's refusal to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles was inconsistent with the plain language and intent of the CAA.
```java
// Pseudocode for understanding the EPA's authority under the CAA
public class CleanAirAct {
    public void checkEPAAuthority(String pollutant, boolean isGreenhouseGas) {
        if (isGreenhouseGas && containsPollutant(pollutant)) {
            System.out.println("EPA has authority to regulate this pollutant.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("EPA does not have clear authority under the CAA for this case.");
        }
    }

    private boolean containsPollutant(String pollutant) {
        // Logic to check if the pollutant is covered by the CAA
        return true; // Assume it returns true based on the case context
    }
}
```
x??

#### Judicial Deference in Benefits Determination
Background context: In Dave Conley's case, his widow applied for benefits under the Black Lung Benefits Act. To qualify, she had to show that exposure to coal dust was a substantial contributing factor to her husband’s death from lung cancer. The administrative law judge awarded benefits based on a physician's testimony without supporting evidence.
:p Should a court defer to the administrative law judge's decision in Conley's case?
??x
A court should not fully defer to the administrative law judge's decision because it lacked proper evidentiary support. The decision was based on unverified and unsupported conclusions, which do not meet the standard required by the Black Lung Benefits Act.
The court should review the evidence more closely and ensure that any findings are supported by sufficient documentation and credible testimony.
```java
// Pseudocode for understanding judicial deference
public class JudicialDeference {
    public void checkDeferral(String decision, boolean hasEvidence) {
        if (decision && !hasEvidence) {
            System.out.println("The court should not defer to the decision.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("The court may consider deferring to the decision based on evidence.");
        }
    }

    private boolean hasSupportingEvidence(String testimony) {
        // Logic to check if there is sufficient supporting evidence
        return false; // Assume it returns false based on the case context
    }
}
```
x??

#### Arbitrary and Capricious Test in Administrative Decisions
Background context: Michael Manin, an airline pilot with a minor misdemeanor conviction, failed to disclose this information when applying for flight certification renewal. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) revoked his certification without considering his argument that he did not know the reporting requirements.
:p Was the NTSB's decision to revoke Manin’s certification arbitrary or capricious?
??x
The NTSB's decision was arbitrary and capricious because it failed to follow its established policy of considering an applicant’s understanding of the information required. Without providing a proper explanation, the agency disregarded relevant context and made an inconsistent ruling.
A court would likely find this decision to be outside the bounds of reasonable administrative action if the NTSB's own procedures were not properly followed.
```java
// Pseudocode for understanding arbitrary and capricious test
public class ArbitraryAndCapriciousTest {
    public void checkDecision(String policy, boolean followsPolicy) {
        if (!followsPolicy && !hasExplanation()) {
            System.out.println("The decision was arbitrary and capricious.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("The decision followed proper procedures.");
        }
    }

    private boolean hasExplanation() {
        // Logic to check if there is an adequate explanation
        return false; // Assume it returns false based on the case context
    }
}
```
x??

#### Aircraft Maintenance and Safety Violation
Background context: Mechanics failed to remove a gear pin during the repair of a CRJ-700 plane's landing gear, leading to warning lights indicating an issue with retraction after takeoff.
:p What is the issue regarding this aircraft maintenance?
??x
The issue lies in the incomplete removal of the gear pin by the mechanics. This oversight could pose significant safety risks, as it may interfere with the proper functioning of the landing gear and lead to potential hazards during flight operations.
A thorough inspection and adherence to maintenance protocols are crucial to ensure the safe operation of aircraft.
```java
// Pseudocode for understanding maintenance checks
public class AircraftMaintenance {
    public void checkGearPin(String pinStatus) {
        if (!pinStatus.equals("removed")) {
            System.out.println("Gear pin not removed; safety risk identified.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Gear pin correctly removed; no immediate safety issue.");
        }
    }

    private boolean isGearPinRemoved() {
        // Logic to check the status of gear pins after maintenance
        return false; // Assume it returns false based on the case context
    }
}
```
