#### Per Capita Distribution
Per capita distribution is a method of distributing an estate where each person in a class or group receives an equal share. This concept is often used when there are multiple beneficiaries who belong to a specific class.

:p What does per capita distribution mean?
??x
Per capita distribution means dividing the estate equally among all members within a specified class, such as children or grandchildren.
x??

---
#### Example 51.8 - Per Capita Distribution
In this example, Michael's estate is distributed on a per capita basis to Becky, Holly, and Paul.

:p How will Michael’s estate be distributed according to the per capita method?
??x
Becky, Holly, and Paul will each receive one-third of Michael's estate because there are three equal recipients.

#### Trusts Overview
A trust is an arrangement where property is transferred from a grantor (the creator) to a trustee who administers it for the benefit of the beneficiaries. Trusts can be created during a person’s lifetime or after death, and they serve various purposes.

:p What defines a trust?
??x
A trust involves three essential elements: a designated beneficiary(ies), a designated trustee, and a fund that is sufficiently identified. The grantor transfers property to the trustee with the intention of administering it for another party's benefit.
x??

---
#### Example 51–3 - Trust Distribution Method
Exhibit 51-3 illustrates the per capita method of distributing an estate among Becky, Holly, and Paul.

:p How does Exhibit 51-3 illustrate trust distribution?
??x
Exhibit 51-3 demonstrates that when an estate is distributed on a per capita basis, each person in the class (Becky, Holly, and Paul) receives an equal share. In this case, each would receive one-third of the total estate.
x??

---
#### Express Trusts
Express trusts are created explicitly in writing by the grantor. These trusts can be tailored to meet specific needs or purposes.

:p What is an express trust?
??x
An express trust is a type of trust that is created with explicit terms, usually through written documentation. It allows for customization and flexibility to serve various purposes.
x??

---
#### Living Trusts (Inter Vivos)
A living trust is a trust established during the grantor's lifetime by transferring assets to a trustee who administers them for the benefit of the beneficiaries.

:p What is a living trust?
??x
A living trust, also known as an inter vivos trust, is created during the grantor’s lifetime. It allows assets to pass directly to heirs without going through probate after the grantor's death.
x??

---
#### Revocable Living Trusts
In a revocable living trust, the grantor retains control over the trust property and can make changes or revoke it at any time.

:p What is a revocable living trust?
??x
A revocable living trust is the most common type of living trust. The grantor retains control over the trust property during their lifetime, has the ability to amend, alter, or revoke the trust, and can receive income from the trust assets.
x??

---
#### Example 51.9 - Living Trust Creation
James Cortez uses his living trust to benefit his three children: Alicia, Emma, and Jacob.

:p How does James Cortez use a living trust?
??x
James Cortez creates a revocable living trust during his lifetime for the benefit of his three children (Alicia, Emma, and Jacob). This allows him to retain control over the trust property while ensuring that it passes directly to his heirs without going through probate.

#### Wills and Trusts: Investment Powers
Background context explaining the concept. Typically, statutes confine trustees to conservative debt securities such as government, utility, and railroad bonds and certain real estate loans. However, a grantor may give a trustee discretionary investment power, making any statute advisory with decisions subject to the prudent person rule.
:p What are the typical investments that trustees are confined to according to most statutes?
??x
Trustees are typically confined to conservative debt securities such as government bonds, utility bonds, railroad bonds, and certain real estate loans. These investments are generally considered lower-risk.
x??

---

#### Wills and Trusts: Prudent Person Rule
Background context explaining the concept. When a grantor gives a trustee discretionary investment power, any statute may be advisory with decisions subject to the prudent person rule. This rule ensures that trustees make sound investment decisions in managing trust assets.
:p How does the prudent person rule apply when a grantor provides a trustee with discretionary investment power?
??x
The prudent person rule applies by ensuring that trustees make investment decisions as a prudent investor would, considering the risks and returns of various investments to protect the trust's principal and income.
x??

#### Wills and Trusts: Allocation Between Principal and Income
Background context explaining the concept. In situations where one beneficiary has a life estate and another has a remainder interest, questions may arise about how receipts and expenses for the farm’s management and the trust’s administration should be allocated between income and principal. The general rule is that ordinary receipts and expenses are chargeable to the income beneficiary, whereas extraordinary receipts and expenses are allocated to the principal beneficiaries.
:p How are receipts and expenses typically allocated in a trust where one beneficiary has a life estate and another has a remainder interest?
??x
Ordinary receipts (e.g., rent from realty) and ordinary expenses (e.g., property taxes) are chargeable to the income beneficiary. Extraordinary receipts (e.g., proceeds from long-term improvements, sale of property) and extraordinary expenses are allocated to the principal beneficiaries.
x??

---

#### Termination of a Trust
Background context explaining the concept. A trust should specify the event on which it will terminate, such as the beneficiary’s or trustee’s death. Without an express provision, the trust may not terminate upon these events. Typically, a termination date is specified in the trust instrument.
:p How can a court order the termination of a trust?
??x
A court may order the termination of a trust if its purpose is fulfilled before the specified date, or if no date is set and the trust’s purpose has been achieved. The court will consider whether it is necessary to continue the trust for any remaining interests.
x??

#### Other Estate-Planning Issues
Background context explaining the concept. Estate planning involves decisions about inheritance of assets and care for minor children. It also includes preparing for contingencies like illness or incapacity.
:p What are some key considerations in estate planning?
??x
Key considerations in estate planning include deciding who will inherit family homes and other assets, choosing caregivers for minor children, and preparing for potential health issues or loss of capacity through the creation of durable powers of attorney, living wills, and other legal documents.

#### Sheila's Will and Mental Capacity
Background context explaining the concept of wills, mental capacity, and intestacy laws. In this case, Sheila made a will leaving her property to Toby, Umeko, and Velda. However, two years later, she was adjudged mentally incompetent, and subsequently died.
:p Can Toby and Umeko have Sheila’s will revoked on the ground that she did not have the capacity to make a will? Why or why not?
??x
Toby and Umeko cannot revoke Sheila's will based on her lack of mental capacity at the time of making it. The law typically requires a will to be made when the testator (Sheila) had the required mental capacity, which includes understanding the nature and extent of their property and the people who might benefit from it. If Sheila was adjudged mentally incompetent after she made the will, this does not affect its validity as long as the will was executed properly at the time of its creation.

However, if Toby and Umeko can present evidence that Sheila lacked capacity when the will was created, they could potentially challenge the will through probate proceedings. But simply being adjudged incompetent later is insufficient to invalidate a will.
??x
The answer with detailed explanations:

// Pseudocode for evaluating mental capacity during will-making process
public class WillEvaluator {
    public boolean hasMentalCapacity(Person testator) {
        // Check if testator had mental capacity at the time of making the will
        return testator.evaluateMentalCapacityAtTimeOfWill();
    }
}
```

#### Rafael's Intestacy Laws
Background context explaining the concept of intestate succession, which occurs when a person dies without leaving a valid will. The law determines who inherits the estate based on the relationships to the deceased.
:p Who inherits what in the absence of a will for Rafael?
??x
In the absence of a will (intestate), Rafael's relatives will inherit his property according to state laws that prioritize direct descendants, then siblings, parents, and so forth. Given Rafael is survived by a spouse, biological children, adopted children, sisters, brothers, uncles, aunts, cousins, nephews, and nieces, the law would typically follow a line of succession starting with spouses and children.

The exact distribution might vary depending on state laws but generally follows this order:
1. Spouse
2. Children (biological and adopted)
3. Parents
4. Siblings
5. Aunts and Uncles
6. Grandparents
7. Other relatives

For example, if Rafael's spouse and children are alive, they would inherit the entire estate as the first priority.

        List<Person> heirs = getHeirs(deceased);
        // Distribute property according to state laws and relationship priority
    }
}
```

#### Benjamin's Will Validity
Background context explaining the concept of wills, specifically focusing on testator validity (mental capacity), witnessing requirements, and per stirpes distribution.
:p Is Benjamin's will valid in the given scenario?
??x
Benjamin's will is likely valid based on the information provided. The will was witnessed by his lawyer and his daughter Patricia, who is not a beneficiary, which satisfies most state requirements for witnessing. Additionally, there is no mention of any issues with mental capacity or undue influence.

However, if Edward claims that the will is invalid, he might argue that it should be contested due to potential issues such as lack of mental capacity at the time of writing, undue influence by Patricia, or a lack of witnesses (though two valid witnesses are mentioned).

To determine validity:
1. Check for mental capacity: Benjamin must have understood and appreciated his property.
2. Proper witnessing: A will usually requires two competent witnesses who sign it in the presence of the testator.
3. No undue influence: The will should be free from any coercion or manipulation.

If all these conditions are met, the will is valid.

        // Check mental capacity, proper witnessing, and lack of undue influence
        return hasMentalCapacity(will.getTestator()) &&
               hasProperWitnessing(will.getWitnesses()) &&
               noUndueInfluenceDetected();
    }
}

#### Specific Bequests in Wills
Background context explaining the concept of specific bequests, which are items or properties explicitly named and transferred to a beneficiary. Discussing what happens when the item is sold before death.
:p Will Roberta inherit her father's 1966 Ferrari under his will if he sells it before his death?
??x
Yes, Roberta would still inherit the specific bequest of her father’s 1966 red Ferrari under his will. Specific bequests are clear instructions to transfer a particular item to a beneficiary regardless of what happens to that item later.

Even though her father sold the 1966 Ferrari and purchased a newer one, this does not affect the validity or enforceability of the specific bequest in the original will. The will specifies "the 1966 red Ferrari," so the current ownership of the car is irrelevant; Roberta would receive the property that matches her father’s description at the time he made the will.

If the will had instead left a sum of money to Roberta for the purchase of such a car, it could have been different. However, specific bequests are irrevocable once made.

        // Check if the item specified exists and distribute accordingly
        Item item = findItemMatchingDescription(will.getSpecificBequest());
        if (item != null) {
            transferOwnership(item, beneficiary);
        }
    }

    private Item findItemMatchingDescription(String description) {
        // Logic to find an item that matches the specific bequest description
        return null;
    }

    private void transferOwnership(Item item, Person beneficiary) {
        // Transfer ownership of the found item to the beneficiary
    }
}
```

#### Revocation and Updating Wills
Background context explaining the concept of will revocation, which can occur when a testator wishes to change or revoke their will. Discussing scenarios with remarriage and new beneficiaries.
:p What happens to James's mother as the sole beneficiary if he dies while married to Lisa without changing his will?
??x
If James died while married to Lisa without changing his will, the estate would typically go to his mother, Carol, according to the original terms of his will. However, intestacy laws may also play a role depending on state-specific rules.

In most states:
- The first priority is the surviving spouse.
- If no spouse exists or if there are no children from that marriage, then the next priority would be other direct descendants and parents.

Given James's will named his mother as the sole beneficiary, unless Lisa has claims under intestacy laws (which vary by state), she would not inherit. The will’s terms would take precedence over intestacy laws in this scenario.

public class WillRevoker {

        // Check if the will is valid and distribute accordingly
        if (will.isValid()) {
            transferOwnership(will.getBeneficiary(), deceased);
        } else {
            // Handle intestacy distribution based on state laws
        }
    }

    private void transferOwnership(Person beneficiary, Person deceased) {
        // Transfer ownership of the estate to the designated beneficiary
    }
}
```

#### Wills and Probate Process
Background context explaining the concept of wills, probate process, and guardianship. Discussing issues with unclaimed estates.
:p What happens when Hall dies intestate, leaving two houses in Maxey's estate but without paying taxes or mortgage payments?
??x
When Hall died intestate (without a valid will), Jordan, his guardian and later the administrator of his estate, became responsible for managing the estate. Since the houses remained in Maxey’s estate but were not maintained by Jordan due to inheritance confusion, several issues may arise:

1. **Responsibility for Estate Management:** Jordan is responsible for paying any outstanding debts, including property taxes and mortgage payments, on behalf of Hall's estate.

2. **Legal Implications:** Not maintaining the properties could result in legal action against Jordan if the rightful owners (Maxey’s heirs) take issue with the lack of care.

3. **Estate Distribution Delay:** Until the debts are settled and necessary repairs or maintenance are completed, Maxey's heirs may not be able to claim their inheritance fully.

1. **Responsibility for Estate Management:** Jordan, as the administrator of Hall's estate, is responsible for paying any outstanding debts, including property taxes and mortgage payments, on behalf of Hall's estate.

2. **Legal Implications:** Not maintaining the properties could result in legal action against Jordan if the rightful owners (Maxey’s heirs) take issue with the lack of care. This could lead to disputes over who is responsible for the upkeep of the properties.

3. **Estate Distribution Delay:** Until the debts are settled and necessary repairs or maintenance are completed, Maxey's heirs may not be able to claim their inheritance fully.

To address these issues:
- Jordan should communicate with Maxey’s heirs to ensure proper management and distribution.
- Legal assistance might be needed to avoid disputes and ensure compliance with probate laws.
```java
// Pseudocode for managing an intestate estate
public class IntestateEstateManager {
    public void manageEstate(Person administrator, List<Property> properties) {
        // Administer the estate by paying debts and maintaining properties
        for (Property property : properties) {
            if (!property.isPaid()) {
                payDebt(property);
            }
        }
    }

    private void payDebt(Property property) {
        // Logic to pay any outstanding debts on behalf of the deceased
    }
}
```
