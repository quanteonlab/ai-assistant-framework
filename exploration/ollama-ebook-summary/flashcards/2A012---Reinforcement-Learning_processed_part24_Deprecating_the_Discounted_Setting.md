**Starting Chapter:** Deprecating the Discounted Setting

---

#### Deprecating the Discounted Setting

Background context explaining the concept. The continuing, discounted problem formulation has been useful in the tabular case but questionable with function approximation due to its reliance on states that are not clearly distinguishable through feature vectors.

:p What would the sequence of \(R_{t+1}^{\bar{R}}\) errors be if one were using a method for estimating average rewards?

??x
The sequence of \(R_{t+1}^{\bar{R}}\) errors, in this context, refers to the errors that occur when averaging returns over a long interval. These errors would depend on the specific nature of the reward sequence and the algorithm used for estimation. However, without a clear state distinction, these errors might not provide useful information as they could be influenced by the same feature vectors representing indistinguishable states.

The key point is that in function approximation, with no clear state boundaries, the averaging of returns over time can still capture the overall performance but may suffer from instability due to potential misrepresentation by similar feature vectors. This makes the errors more likely to be a reflection of the similarity between states rather than distinct reward contributions.

#### Discounted vs Average Reward in Function Approximation

Background context explaining the concept. The text discusses how discounting rewards might not be necessary or beneficial in function approximation settings, as it can lead to the same ranking of policies as undiscounted average reward.

:p How does the discounted return relate to the average reward in a continuing setting?

??x
In the continuing setting with no clear start or end states, the discounted return can be shown to be proportional to the average reward. Specifically, for policy \(\pi\), the average of the discounted returns is always \(r(\pi)/(1-\gamma)\), where \(\gamma\) is the discount rate.

This means that the discounting factor does not affect the ordering of policies in terms of their performance. The key idea behind this result is the symmetry of time steps, where each reward appears in different positions with a specific weight given by \(1 + \gamma + \gamma^2 + \gamma^3 + \cdots = 1/(1-\gamma)\).

Thus, if we optimize discounted value over the on-policy distribution, it has the same effect as optimizing undiscounted average reward. The discount rate \(\gamma\) effectively does not change the ranking of policies.

```java
public class DiscountVsAverageReward {
    // Example method to calculate the weight on a reward in different returns
    public double getWeightOnReward(double gamma) {
        return 1 / (1 - gamma);
    }
}
```

#### Policy Improvement Theorem and Function Approximation

Background context explaining the concept. The policy improvement theorem, which guarantees that improving one state's value improves the overall policy, is lost when using function approximation. This loss of the policy improvement theorem can lead to issues in ensuring meaningful optimization of policies.

:p Why might discounting not be useful for control problems with function approximation?

??x
Discounting might not be useful for control problems with function approximation because it does not provide a clear benefit over undiscounted average reward. The discount rate \(\gamma\) has no effect on the ordering of policies, as the average of discounted returns is proportional to the average reward.

This means that optimizing discounted value over the on-policy distribution results in the same ranking of policies as optimizing undiscounted average reward. In practice, this implies that using discounting does not change the overall optimization outcome and might introduce unnecessary complexity without providing additional benefits.

Additionally, with function approximation, we lose the policy improvement theorem (Section 4.2), which ensures that improving one state's value leads to an improved overall policy. This loss of a theoretical guarantee means that methods relying on function approximation cannot be guaranteed to optimize average reward or any other equivalent discounted value over the on-policy distribution.

```java
public class DiscountingInFunctionApproximation {
    // Example method to calculate the effect of discounting
    public double calculateDiscountedReturn(double r, double gamma) {
        return r / (1 - gamma);
    }
}
```
x??

#### Futility of Discounting in Continuing Problems

Background context explaining the concept. The text suggests that even if one attempts to use a discounted objective function with function approximation, it does not provide any additional benefit over undiscounted average reward.

:p What is the proposed objective for using discounting in continuous problems?

??x
The proposed objective when using discounting in continuous problems is to sum discounted values over the distribution with which states occur under the policy. This can be written as:

\[ J(\pi) = \sum_{s} \mu_\pi(s)v^\pi(s) (w h e r e v^\pi \text{ is the discounted value function}) \]

This objective simplifies to:

\[ J(\pi) = \sum_{s}\mu_\pi(s)\sum_{a}\pi(a|s)\sum_{s'}\sum_{r}p(s',r|s,a)[r + \gamma v^\pi(s')] (Bellman Eq.) \]

And further simplifies due to the properties of the discounted value function:

\[ J(\pi) = r(\pi) + \sum_{s}\mu_\pi(s)\sum_{a}\pi(a|s)\sum_{s'}\sum_{r}p(s',r|s,a)\gamma v^\pi(s') \]

Using the definition of \(v^\pi\) and properties, it results in:

\[ J(\pi) = r(\pi) + \gamma J(\pi) \]

Which simplifies to:

\[ J(\pi) = \frac{r(\pi)}{1 - \gamma} \]

This shows that the proposed discounted objective orders policies identically to the undiscounted (average reward) objective, and the discount rate \(\gamma\) does not influence the ordering.

```java
public class DiscountedObjective {
    // Example method to calculate the discounted objective value
    public double calculateDiscountedObjective(double r, double gamma) {
        return r / (1 - gamma);
    }
}
```

#### Diﬀerential Semi-gradient n-step Sarsa Overview
Diﬀerential semi-gradient n-step Sarsa generalizes the traditional n-step bootstrapping method for function approximation. It involves an update based on a diﬀerential form of the n-step return, which accounts for multiple rewards over several steps rather than just one step.
:p What is the primary objective of Diﬀerential Semi-gradient n-step Sarsa?
??x
The primary objective is to generalize the traditional semi-gradient n-step Sarsa method by incorporating function approximation and handling multiple steps in a single update. This approach allows for more accurate value function updates when using function approximations.
x??

---
#### n-step Return Formulation
The n-step return Gt:t+n is defined as the sum of estimated future rewards up to step t+n, adjusted based on the current estimate of the average reward and the estimated action-values:
\[ G_{t:t+n} = R_{t+1} - \bar{R}_{t+n-1} + \cdots + R_{t+n} - \bar{R}_{t+n} + \hat{q}(S_{t+n}, A_{t+n}, w) \]
where \(\bar{R}\) is an estimate of the average reward, and \(w\) represents the weights of the function approximation.
:p How is the n-step return defined in Diﬀerential Semi-gradient n-step Sarsa?
??x
The n-step return is defined as:
\[ G_{t:t+n} = R_{t+1} - \bar{R}_{t+n-1} + \cdots + R_{t+n} - \bar{R}_{t+n} + \hat{q}(S_{t+n}, A_{t+n}, w) \]
where \(R_i\) are the rewards, \(\bar{R}\) is an estimate of the average reward, and \(\hat{q}(S_{t+n}, A_{t+n}, w)\) represents the estimated action-value function. This formulation allows for a more accurate update by considering multiple steps.
x??

---
#### n-step TD Error
The n-step TD error is defined as the diﬀerence between the actual n-step return and the predicted value:
\[ \delta_t = G_{t:t+n} - \hat{q}(S_t, A_t, w) \]
This error term guides the updates to the action-value function.
:p How is the n-step TD error calculated in Diﬀerential Semi-gradient n-step Sarsa?
??x
The n-step TD error is calculated as:
\[ \delta_t = G_{t:t+n} - \hat{q}(S_t, A_t, w) \]
where \(G_{t:t+n}\) is the n-step return and \(\hat{q}(S_t, A_t, w)\) is the predicted value. This error term helps in updating the action-value function more accurately.
x??

#### Algorithm Pseudocode
The pseudocode for Diﬀerential Semi-gradient n-step Sarsa involves several steps including updating weights, estimating rewards, and selecting actions based on a policy:
```pseudocode
// Initialization
Initialize value-function weights w ∈ R^d arbitrarily (e.g., w = 0)
Initialize average-reward estimate ¯R ∈ R arbitrarily (e.g., ¯R = 0)

// Algorithm parameters: step size α, ε > 0, a positive integer n

Loop for each step t = 0, 1, 2, ...
    Take action At
    Observe and store the next reward as Rt+1 and the next state as St+1
    Select and store an action At+1 according to policy π or ε-greedy with respect to q(St+1, ·, w)
    If t + n < T:
        Gt:t+n = R_{t+1} - \bar{R}_{t+n-1} + ... + R_{t+n} - \bar{R}_{t+n} + \hat{q}(S_{t+n}, A_{t+n}, w)
    Else:
        Gt:t+n = Gt
    δt = Gt:t+n - \hat{q}(St, At, w)
    
    // Update weights using a single step of gradient ascent
    w <- w + α * (δt) * ∇w \hat{q}(S_t, A_t, w)
```
:p What is the pseudocode for Diﬀerential Semi-gradient n-step Sarsa?
??x
The pseudocode for Diﬀerential Semi-gradient n-step Sarsa is as follows:

```pseudocode
// Initialization
Initialize value-function weights w ∈ R^d arbitrarily (e.g., w = 0)
Initialize average-reward estimate ¯R ∈ R arbitrarily (e.g., ¯R = 0)

// Algorithm parameters: step size α, ε > 0, a positive integer n

Loop for each step t = 0, 1, 2, ...
    Take action At
    Observe and store the next reward as Rt+1 and the next state as St+1
    Select and store an action At+1 according to policy π or ε-greedy with respect to q(St+1, ·, w)
    If t + n < T:
        Gt:t+n = R_{t+1} - \bar{R}_{t+n-1} + ... + R_{t+n} - \bar{R}_{t+n} + \hat{q}(S_{t+n}, A_{t+n}, w)
    Else:
        Gt:t+n = Gt
    δt = Gt:t+n - \hat{q}(St, At, w)
    
    // Update weights using a single step of gradient ascent
    w <- w + α * (δt) * ∇w \hat{q}(S_t, A_t, w)
```

This pseudocode outlines the steps to update the action-value function using the n-step return and TD error.

#### Unbiased Constant-Step-size Trick for Average Reward
In Diﬀerential Semi-gradient n-step Sarsa, the step size parameter on the average reward (ε) needs to be small to ensure that \(\bar{R}\) becomes a good long-term estimate. However, this can make learning inefficient due to initial bias in \(\bar{R}\). An alternative is using a sample average of observed rewards for \(\bar{R}\), but it adapts slowly and may not handle nonstationary policies well.

The unbiased constant-step-size trick involves adjusting the step size parameter ε to ensure that \(\bar{R}\) converges without initial bias.
:p How can the unbiased constant-step-size trick be applied in Diﬀerential Semi-gradient n-step Sarsa?
??x
To apply the unbiased constant-step-size trick in Diﬀerential Semi-gradient n-step Sarsa, you need to adjust the step size parameter \(\epsilon\) such that it converges properly without initial bias. This can be done by using an adaptive step size based on the average reward estimate over time.

Here are the specific changes needed:

1. **Initialize the average-reward estimate**: 
   ```pseudocode
   Initialize ¯R2R arbitrarily (e.g., ¯R = 0)
   ```

2. **Update the average-reward estimate** in a way that incorporates a constant step size:
   ```pseudocode
   If t + n < T:
       Gt:t+n = R_{t+1} - \bar{R}_{t+n-1} + ... + R_{t+n} - \bar{R}_{t+n} + \hat{q}(S_{t+n}, A_{t+n}, w)
   Else:
       Gt:t+n = Gt
   δt = Gt:t+n - \hat{q}(St, At, w)

   // Update the average reward estimate
   ¯R <- (1 - ε) * ¯R + ε * (Gt:t+n / n)
   
   // Update weights using a single step of gradient ascent
   w <- w + α * δt * ∇w \hat{q}(S_t, A_t, w)
```

The key change is updating the average reward estimate with each time step in a way that ensures it converges unbiasedly. This involves using an adaptive step size to adjust the average reward over time.

#### Semi-gradient Sarsa Introduction
Background context: The first exploration of semi-gradient Sarsa with function approximation was by Rummery and Niranjan (1994). Linear semi-gradient Sarsa with \(\epsilon\)-greedy action selection does not converge in the usual sense but enters a bounded region near the best solution. Precup and Perkins (2003) showed convergence under differentiable action selection settings.
:p What was the initial exploration of Semi-gradient Sarsa with function approximation?
??x
Rummery and Niranjan (1994) first explored semi-gradient Sarsa with function approximation. This method does not converge in the usual sense but enters a bounded region near the best solution when using \(\epsilon\)-greedy action selection.

#### Episodic n-step Semi-gradient Sarsa
Background context: Episodic n-step semi-gradient Sarsa is based on the forward Sarsa(λ) algorithm of van Seijen (2016). The empirical results shown here are new to the second edition of this text.
:p What is the basis for episodic n-step Semi-gradient Sarsa?
??x
Episodic n-step semi-gradient Sarsa is based on the forward Sarsa(λ) algorithm proposed by van Seijen (2016). This method uses an n-step return to update the value function.
x??

---

#### Average-reward Formulation
Background context: The average-reward formulation has been described for dynamic programming and from the point of view of reinforcement learning. The algorithm here is the on-policy analog of R-learning, introduced by Schwartz (1993). The access-control queuing example was suggested by Carlström and Nordström (1997).
:p What is the average-reward formulation used for in reinforcement learning?
??x
The average-reward formulation is a way to frame reinforcement learning problems where the goal is not to maximize discounted rewards but to optimize the long-term average reward. This approach was introduced as an on-policy analog of R-learning, and it has been discussed in various contexts including dynamic programming.
x??

---

#### Off-policy Methods with Approximation
Background context: The book treats off-policy methods since Chapter 5 primarily as two alternative ways of handling the conflict between exploitation and exploration inherent in learning forms of generalized policy iteration. The extension to function approximation turns out to be significantly different and harder for off-policy learning than it is for on-policy learning.
:p How does the extension to function approximation differ in off-policy learning compared to on-policy?
??x
The extension to function approximation in off-policy learning is more challenging than in on-policy learning. While tabular methods can easily extend to semi-gradient algorithms, these do not converge as robustly under off-policy training. The key challenges involve both the target of updates and the distribution of those updates.
x??

---

#### Challenges in Off-policy Learning
Background context: In off-policy learning, we seek to learn a value function for a target policy \(\pi\), given data due to a different behavior policy \(b\). There are two main parts to the challenge: one that arises in the tabular case and another only with function approximation. The first part concerns the target of updates, while the second involves the distribution of those updates.
:p What are the two main challenges in off-policy learning?
??x
The two main challenges in off-policy learning are:
1. **Target of Updates**: Determining how to update value functions given data from a different behavior policy.
2. **Distribution of Updates**: Ensuring that the updates are distributed appropriately to reflect the target policy's behavior.

These challenges are more pronounced when using function approximation rather than tabular methods.
x??

---

#### Importance Sampling in Function Approximation
Importance sampling is a technique that addresses the first part of the challenge in off-policy learning, which involves changing the update targets. However, it does not address the second part related to the distribution of updates.

:p What is importance sampling used for in function approximation?
??x
Importance sampling is used to modify the update targets so they align better with those from an on-policy method, ensuring that semi-gradient methods are guaranteed stable and asymptotically unbiased when dealing with tabular cases or specific forms of function approximation. This technique adjusts the weight updates by incorporating a ratio of policy probabilities.
```python
# Example code for importance sampling adjustment
def update_weight(weight, reward, next_state, current_state, action):
    # Importance sampling ratio
    importance_sampling_ratio = policy_probability(next_state, action) / behavior_policy_probability(current_state, action)
    
    # Adjusted weight update
    new_weight = weight + alpha * importance_sampling_ratio * (reward + discount_factor * target_value(next_state) - weight[current_state][action])
```
x??

---

#### Semi-gradient Methods for Off-policy Learning with Function Approximation
Semi-gradient methods extend the techniques from earlier chapters to function approximation, handling the first part of the off-policy learning challenge by updating weights instead of array values.

:p How do semi-gradient methods convert tabular oﬄ- policy algorithms into function approximation forms?
??x
To convert a tabular off-policy algorithm into its semi-gradient form for function approximation, you replace updates to an array (V or Q) with updates to a weight vector. This involves using the approximate value function and its gradient. For instance, in one-step, state-value learning, the update rule becomes:
\[ w_{t+1} = w_t + \alpha \pi_t v^\pi(S_t, w) \]
where \( \pi_t \) is the importance sampling ratio.

Here’s an example of converting a one-step off-policy TD(0) to its semi-gradient form:

```java
// Semi-gradient off-policy TD(0)
public void updateWeights(double[] weights, double reward, int nextState, int currentState, Action action, double discountFactor) {
    // Importance Sampling Ratio
    double importanceSamplingRatio = behaviorPolicyProbability(currentState, action) / targetPolicyProbability(nextState);
    
    // Update the weight vector
    for (int i = 0; i < weights.length; i++) {
        weights[i] += alpha * importanceSamplingRatio * (reward + discountFactor * targetValueFunction[nextState][i] - weights[currentState]);
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Updating Weights in Off-policy TD(0) with Importance Sampling
The one-step off-policy TD(0) algorithm uses the per-step importance sampling ratio to adjust weight updates, ensuring that they are more aligned with on-policy learning objectives.

:p How does the semi-gradient off-policy TD(0) update rule work?
??x
The semi-gradient off-policy TD(0) update rule incorporates a per-step importance sampling ratio \(\pi_t\), defined as:
\[ \pi_t = \frac{\rho_{t:t+1}}{b_{t:t+1}} \]
where \( b_{t:t+1} \) is the behavior policy probability of taking action \(A_t\) in state \(S_t\), and \( \rho_{t:t+1} \) is the importance sampling ratio.

The update rule for weights in this context becomes:
\[ w_{t+1} = w_t + \alpha \pi_t (r_t + \gamma v(S_{t+1}, w_t) - v(S_t, w_t)) \]
where \( r_t \) is the reward at time step \( t \), and \( v(S, w) \) is the approximate value function.

Here’s an example of this update in pseudocode:
```java
// Semi-gradient off-policy TD(0)
public void updateWeights(double[] weights, double reward, int nextState, double discountFactor) {
    // Importance Sampling Ratio for current state-action pair
    double importanceSamplingRatio = behaviorPolicyProbability(currentState, action) / targetPolicyProbability(currentState);
    
    // Update the weight vector
    weights[currentState] += alpha * importanceSamplingRatio * (reward + discountFactor * valueFunction[nextState] - weights[currentState]);
}
```
x??

---

#### Off-policy Expected Sarsa with Function Approximation
Expected SARSA, a variant of off-policy TD learning, uses the per-step importance sampling ratio to update action values in function approximation form.

:p How does expected SARSA for function approximation handle updates?
??x
In the context of function approximation, expected SARSA updates action values using an importance sampling ratio. The update rule is:
\[ w_{t+1} = w_t + \alpha \pi_t q^\pi(S_t, A_t, w) \]
where \( \pi_t \) is the importance sampling ratio.

The importance sampling ratio is defined as:
\[ \pi_t = \frac{\rho_{t:t+1}}{b_{t:t+1}} \]

For one-step expected SARSA, the update rule becomes:
\[ w_{t+1} = w_t + \alpha \pi_t (r_t + \gamma \sum_a \pi(a|S_{t+1}) q(S_{t+1}, a, w) - q(S_t, A_t, w)) \]

Here’s an example in pseudocode:
```java
// Semi-gradient off-policy Expected SARSA
public void updateWeights(double[] weights, double reward, int nextState, Action nextAction, double discountFactor) {
    // Importance Sampling Ratio for current state-action pair
    double importanceSamplingRatio = behaviorPolicyProbability(currentState, action) / targetPolicyProbability(currentState);
    
    // Update the weight vector
    weights[currentState][action] += alpha * importanceSamplingRatio * (reward + discountFactor * sumOfActionValues(nextState, nextAction) - weights[currentState][action]);
}
```
x??

#### Importance Sampling in Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

Background context: In reinforcement learning, importance sampling is a technique used to adjust for differences between the distribution of samples and the target policy. This becomes necessary when we want to estimate values or policies based on actions chosen by different policies.

In the tabular case, importance sampling might not be needed because only one action \(A_t\) is sampled at each step, and its value can be directly estimated without considering other potential actions. However, with function approximation, it may become necessary to weight different state-action pairs differently, as they all contribute to a single overall approximation.

:p In the context of reinforcement learning algorithms, when would importance sampling typically be used?
??x
Importance sampling is typically used in scenarios where there is a mismatch between the distribution of actions chosen by an agent during exploration and those required for estimating values or policies. This often arises with function approximation methods, as different state-action pairs contribute to a single overall approximation.

For example, if we are using a target policy \( \pi' \) that is different from the behavior policy \( \pi_b \), importance sampling is needed to properly weight the contributions of each action. The importance weight for an action \( A_t \) in state \( S_t \) would be:

\[
w_t = \frac{\pi'(S_t, A_t)}{\pi_b(S_t, A_t)}
\]

This ensures that actions taken by the behavior policy are appropriately weighted according to their probabilities under the target policy.

#### n-Step Generalizations of Semi-gradient Expected Sarsa

Background context: The semi-gradient Expected Sarsa algorithm is a method for estimating value functions in reinforcement learning. In its multi-step generalization, importance sampling is used to account for differences between policies. This involves adjusting the updates based on the probability ratios between the target and behavior policies.

:p What is the formula for updating weights in the n-step semi-gradient Expected Sarsa algorithm?
??x
The weight update rule for the n-step semi-gradient Expected Sarsa algorithm is given by:

\[
w_{t+n} = w_{t+n-1} + \alpha \left[ G_{t:t+n} - \hat{q}(S_t, A_t, w_{t+n-1}) \right] \hat{q}(S_t, A_t, w_{t+n-1})
\]

where \( G_{t:t+n} = R_{t+1} + \gamma \cdot ... + \gamma^{n-1} R_{t+n} + \pi'(S_{t+n}, A_{t+n}) \) or, for episodic returns, \( G_{t:t+n} = R_{t+1} - \bar{R}_{t} + ... + R_{t+n} - \bar{R}_{t+n-1} + \pi'(S_{t+n}, A_{t+n}) \).

Here, the importance weights are implicitly handled through the expectation over the target policy.

??x
---

#### Off-policy Algorithms and n-step Tree Backup

Background context: Off-policy algorithms allow learning about one policy (the target) while following a different behavior policy. The n-step tree-backup algorithm is an off-policy method that does not require importance sampling for its updates, making it simpler to implement compared to other off-policy methods.

:p How does the update rule in the semi-gradient n-step tree-backup algorithm differ from that of Expected Sarsa?
??x
The update rule for the semi-gradient n-step tree-backup algorithm is given by:

\[
w_{t+n} = w_{t+n-1} + \alpha \left[ G_{t:t+n} - \hat{q}(S_t, A_t, w_{t+n-1}) \right] \hat{q}(S_t, A_t, w_{t+n-1})
\]

where

\[
G_{t:t+n} = \hat{q}(S_t, A_t, w_{t-1}) + \sum_{k=t+1}^{t+n-1} \gamma^k \pi(A_k|S_k) \hat{q}(S_k, A_k, w_{t+n-1})
\]

Here, the importance weight for each step \( k \) is given by:

\[
\prod_{i=t+1}^{k-1} \pi(A_i|S_i)
\]

This product accounts for the different policies at each step. The algorithm avoids explicit use of importance sampling weights, making it simpler to implement.

??x
---

#### n-step Q(λ) Algorithm

Background context: The n-step Q(λ) algorithm unifies various action-value algorithms and provides a flexible framework that can handle both off-policy and on-policy learning. It also allows for different levels of eligibility traces to be used, enhancing its adaptability.

:p How is the semi-gradient form of the n-step Q(λ) algorithm defined?
??x
The semi-gradient form of the n-step Q(λ) algorithm involves updates based on the return \( G_{t:t+n} \):

\[
w_{t+n} = w_{t+n-1} + \alpha \left[ G_{t:t+n} - \hat{q}(S_t, A_t, w_{t+n-1}) \right] \hat{q}(S_t, A_t, w_{t+n-1})
\]

The return \( G_{t:t+n} \) can be defined for both episodic and continuing tasks:

For episodic returns:
\[
G_{t:t+n} = R_{t+1} - \bar{R}_{t} + ... + R_{t+n} - \bar{R}_{t+n-1} + \hat{q}(S_{t+n}, A_{t+n}, w_{t+n-1})
\]

For continuing returns:
\[
G_{t:t+n} = R_{t+1} + \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \gamma^{n+k} \pi'(A_{t+n+k}|S_{t+n+k}) \hat{q}(S_{t+n+k}, A_{t+n+k}, w_{t+n-1})
\]

These definitions ensure that the algorithm can handle both types of tasks appropriately.

#### Problematic Transition Example

Background context explaining the concept. In this example, we consider a scenario where an agent is learning using off-policy methods with function approximation. The setup involves two states, each represented by simple feature vectors (1 and 2), and linear function approximation to estimate their values.

If \( w \) is the parameter vector consisting of only one component, the value of the first state is given as \( w \) and the second state's value is \( 2w \). The transition dynamics are such that from the first state (with estimated value \( w \)), a deterministic action results in moving to the second state with a reward of \( 0.2w^2 \).

Given this setup, let’s analyze what happens when we start with an initial parameter value \( w = 10 \):

:p What is the issue highlighted by this example?
??x
The issue highlighted is that off-policy learning methods can diverge under certain conditions due to a mismatch between the distribution of updates and the on-policy distribution. Specifically, in this case, repeated transitions from one state to another cause the value function to increase indefinitely.

Explanation: The transition from the first state (with estimated value \( w \)) results in moving to the second state with an increased estimate of \( 2w \). This pattern can lead to a continuous feedback loop where the parameter \( w \) keeps increasing, causing instability and divergence.

```java
// Pseudocode for the update process
public class ValueUpdate {
    private double w;
    private double alpha; // Learning rate

    public void update(double reward, double nextWValue) {
        double tdError = reward + nextWValue - w;
        w += alpha * (2 * w - 1) * tdError; // Simplified version for illustration
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Importance Sampling Ratio Calculation

Background context explaining the importance of the importance sampling ratio in off-policy learning methods. In this example, the importance sampling ratio is crucial to understanding why the parameter \( w \) diverges.

Given that there is only one action available from the first state, the probability of taking this action under both the target and behavior policies is 1. Thus, the importance sampling ratio \( \rho_t = 1 \).

:p What is the importance of the importance sampling ratio in off-policy learning?
??x
The importance sampling ratio is critical because it adjusts the weight given to transitions based on how well they align with the target policy compared to the behavior policy. In this case, since both policies are equivalent (the action probability is 1), the importance sampling ratio \( \rho_t = 1 \).

This simplifies the off-policy update rule and highlights that the parameter \( w \) will be updated based on a direct gradient.

```java
// Pseudocode for importance sampling adjustment
public class ImportanceSampling {
    public double getImportanceRatio(double behaviorProbability, double targetProbability) {
        return (behaviorProbability / targetProbability);
    }
}
```

#### TD Error Calculation

Background context explaining the calculation of the Temporal Difference (TD) error in this example. The TD error is a key component that drives the update rule for the parameter \( w \).

Given the reward from transitioning to the second state as \( 0.2w^2 \), the initial value estimate in the first state is \( w = 10 \). Therefore, the transition will move the system from an estimated value of \( w \) to \( 2w \).

:p What is the TD error for a transition between two states?
??x
The TD error for a transition between the two states can be calculated as:

\[ \delta_t = R_{t+1} + \hat{v}(S_{t+1}, w_t) - \hat{v}(S_t, w_t) \]

For this example:
- \( R_{t+1} = 0.2w^2 \)
- Initial value in the first state: \( \hat{v}(S_t, w_t) = w_t = 10 \)
- Value after transition to second state: \( \hat{v}(S_{t+1}, w_t) = 2w_t = 20 \)

Therefore, the TD error is:
\[ \delta_t = 0.2(10)^2 + 20 - 10 = 20 + 20 - 10 = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Thus, the TD error for this transition is 20.

```java
// Pseudocode for calculating TD error
public class TDError {
    public double calculateTDError(double reward, double nextValue, double currentValue) {
        return reward + nextValue - currentValue;
    }
}
```

#### Update Rule for Parameter \( w \)

Background context explaining the update rule for the parameter \( w \). This involves understanding how the TD error influences the parameter value in an off-policy learning setting.

Given that the importance sampling ratio is 1, and the step size \( \alpha = 0.1 \), the update rule can be simplified as:

\[ w_{t+1} = w_t + \alpha (2w - 1) \delta_t \]

:p What is the update rule for parameter \( w \)?
??x
The update rule for parameter \( w \) in this example is given by:

\[ w_{t+1} = w_t + \alpha (2w - 1) \delta_t \]

Where:
- \( \alpha \) is the step size or learning rate.
- \( \delta_t \) is the TD error, which for a transition from state \( S_t \) to state \( S_{t+1} \) is calculated as:

\[ \delta_t = R_{t+1} + 2w - w = 0.2w^2 + 2w - w = 0.2w^2 + w \]

Given the initial value \( w_0 = 10 \), and step size \( \alpha = 0.1 \):

\[ w_{t+1} = w_t + 0.1 (2w_t - 1)(0.2w_t^2 + w_t) \]

This update rule shows how the parameter \( w \) is adjusted based on the TD error and step size.

```java
// Pseudocode for updating parameter w
public class ParameterUpdate {
    public double updateParameter(double currentW, double alpha) {
        double tdError = 0.2 * Math.pow(currentW, 2) + currentW;
        return currentW + alpha * (2 * currentW - 1) * tdError;
    }
}
```

#### Off-Policy Training vs On-Policy Training Divergence

Background context: The provided text explains the difference between off-policy and on-policy training, focusing on how these methods can lead to divergence. In off-policy training, the behavior policy might select actions that the target policy would not choose, leading to potential updates based on transitions the target policy never sees. Conversely, in on-policy training, every transition follows the current policy, ensuring consistency but risking instability if the system is not updated correctly.

:p What distinguishes off-policy and on-policy methods in terms of divergence?
??x
Off-policy methods can diverge because the behavior policy may select actions that the target policy never chooses. In these cases, \( \pi_t = 0 \), leading to potential updates based on transitions the target policy does not experience. On-policy methods avoid this issue as every transition adheres to the current policy, but they must ensure the system remains stable by consistently updating based on future rewards.

#### Baird's Counterexample

Background context: The text introduces a specific example (Baird’s counterexample) that demonstrates why off-policy training can lead to instability. This MDP consists of seven states with two actions, where one action leads uniformly to the seventh state, and the other action leads to any of the six upper states with equal probability.

:p What is Baird's counterexample used to illustrate?
??x
Baird’s counterexample illustrates why off-policy training can lead to divergence. It uses a seven-state MDP with two actions where one action typically results in the seventh state, and the other action leads uniformly to any of the six upper states. This setup shows that even with zero rewards and a high discount factor, the system may not converge due to the mismatch between the behavior policy and the target policy.

#### State-Value Function Estimation

Background context: The text describes estimating state values under a linear parameterization in the given MDP using Baird’s counterexample. It explains how the approximate value function is represented by linear expressions involving weight vectors.

:p How is the state-value function estimated in this example?
??x
The state-value function is estimated using a linear parameterization. For each state, the value is represented as a weighted sum of features. In Baird’s counterexample, the leftmost state's value is given by \( 2w_1 + w_8 \), where \( w \) is the weight vector. This means that the feature vector for the first state is \( x(1) = (2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1)^T \).

The reward is always zero, so the true value function \( v_{\pi}(s) = 0 \) for all states. However, with more components in the weight vector than nonterminal states, multiple solutions exist.

---

#### On-Policy Training Stability

Background context: The text emphasizes that on-policy training keeps the system stable by ensuring future rewards are always met and maintaining consistency through the policy updates.

:p Why does on-policy training maintain stability?
??x
On-policy training maintains stability because it ensures that every transition adheres to the current policy. This means that for each state, the next-state distribution follows the policy being used. As a result, the system is kept in check by always updating based on future rewards according to the current policy, preventing divergence.

#### Divergence in MDPs

Background context: The text suggests that even with simple setups like Baird’s counterexample, complete systems can exhibit instability due to mismatches between behavior and target policies.

:p Can a complete system with simple rules lead to instability?
??x
Yes, a complete system with simple rules can indeed lead to instability. Even in the case of Baird's counterexample, despite having only seven states and two actions, the mismatch between the behavior policy (selecting uniformly from six upper states) and the target policy (always selecting the solid action leading to state 7) causes the system to diverge. This is because off-policy methods may make updates based on transitions that the target policy never sees, leading to potential instability.

#### Linear Independence and Feature Vectors
Background context: The feature vectors, \(\{x(s):s\in S\}\), are linearly independent. This property is crucial for ensuring that the task can be handled favorably with linear function approximation.

:p What does it mean when a set of feature vectors is described as linearly independent?
??x
When a set of feature vectors, \(\{x(s):s\in S\}\), is linearly independent, it means that no vector in the set can be expressed as a linear combination of the others. This property ensures that each state \(s\) has a unique representation, which simplifies the task of approximating values using these feature vectors.

#### Semi-Gradient TD(0) Instability
Background context: Applying semi-gradient TD(0) to this problem results in weights diverging to infinity for any positive step size. This instability persists even when using the expected update as in dynamic programming (DP).

:p What happens if we apply semi-gradient TD(0) with a small step size to this problem?
??x
If we apply semi-gradient TD(0) with a small step size, the weights diverge to infinity. The divergence occurs because of the inherent instability of using semi-gradient updates in combination with linear function approximation and off-policy distribution.
x??

---

#### Instability with DP Updates
Background context: Even if an expected update is done as in dynamic programming (DP), the system remains unstable. This happens regardless of whether the weights are updated synchronously or asynchronously.

:p How does applying a synchronous DP update affect the stability of the system?
??x
Applying a synchronous DP update, which uses the expectation-based target, still results in instability. The method is otherwise conventional but incorporates semi-gradient function approximation, leading to divergence even with perfect synchronization.
x??

---

#### On-Policy Distribution and Stability
Background context: Altering the distribution of DP updates from uniform to on-policy (which generally requires asynchronous updating) guarantees convergence to a solution with error bounded by \((9.14)\).

:p What effect does using an on-policy update distribution have on stability?
??x
Using an on-policy update distribution, which typically requires asynchronous updating, ensures that the system converges to a solution with an error bound. This shows that instability can be resolved if updates follow the correct policy.
x??

#### Baird’s Counterexample
Background context: Baird's counterexample demonstrates that even the simplest combination of bootstrapping and function approximation can be unstable if the updates are not done according to the on-policy distribution.

:p How does Baird's counterexample illustrate instability in semi-gradient algorithms?
??x
Baird's counterexample shows that semi-gradient TD(0) diverges to infinity for any positive step size, even when using expected updates as in dynamic programming. This highlights that simply combining bootstrapping with function approximation can lead to instability if the updates do not follow the on-policy distribution.

#### Tsitsiklis and Van Roy's Counterexample
Background context: The counterexample from Tsitsiklis and Van Roy demonstrates that linear function approximation with least-squares solutions at each step does not guarantee stability, even when using an on-policy update distribution.

:p What issue does the Tsitsiklis and Van Roy example address?
??x
The Tsitsiklis and Van Roy example shows that even if the least-squares solution is found at each step, linear function approximation can still be unstable. This highlights that simply minimizing the value error does not ensure convergence.
