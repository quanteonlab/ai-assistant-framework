**Starting Chapter:** 15.2 Documenting Classes with Javadoc. Problem. Solution. Discussion

---

#### Javadoc Overview
Javadoc is a tool that generates documentation from comments within Java source files. These comments follow specific formats to provide detailed descriptions, parameters, exceptions, and more. This approach ensures that developers can easily understand class interfaces and usage patterns without needing extensive manual documentation.

:p What is Javadoc used for?
??x
Javadoc is used to generate comprehensive documentation for Java classes, methods, and fields by analyzing special comments placed within the code. These comments provide detailed descriptions, parameter explanations, exception handling notes, and more.
x??

---
#### Usage of Javadoc Comments
Javadoc comments are similar to multiline Java comments but begin with `/**` and end with `*/`. They must be immediately before the class, method, or field they document; otherwise, they will be ignored.

:p How do you write a simple Javadoc comment for a class?
??x
To write a simple Javadoc comment for a class, start the comment block right after the `public` keyword and use `/**` to begin the comment. Provide a brief description of the class within the comment.
```java
/**
 * A sample Java class that performs basic operations.
 */
public class SampleClass {
    // Class body
}
```

#### Javadoc Keywords
Javadoc uses specific keywords prefixed by the at sign (@) in certain contexts, such as `@author`, `@param`, `@return`, and more. These keywords help to structure the documentation effectively.

:p List some of the important Javadoc keywords.
??x
Some important Javadoc keywords include:
- `@author`: Specifies the author(s) of the class or method.
- `@param`: Describes a parameter in a method.
- `@return`: Explains what the return value does if applicable.
- `@throws`: Lists exceptions that may be thrown by the method.

Example:
```java
/**
 * A sample method with parameters and a description.
 * @param input The data to process.
 * @return The result of processing the input.
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException If the input is invalid.
 */
public String processInput(int input) {
    // Method body
}
```

#### Running Javadoc Tool
To generate documentation, you can run the `javadoc` tool from the command line. It processes Java source files and produces HTML-based documentation.

:p How do you use javadoc to generate class documentation?
??x
You can use the `javadoc` tool by running a command like:
```sh
javadoc -author -version JavadocDemo.java
```
This command generates documentation for the specified class, including author and version information. You can also specify other options such as `-link` to link to standard JDK documentation.
x??

---
#### Package Documentation
For better organization, you can provide package summary files that will be incorporated into the generated documentation. This makes it easier to navigate through multiple classes.

:p How do you document a package using Javadoc?
??x
To document a package, create a `package.html` file in the appropriate directory and include relevant information about the package. The content of this file will appear as part of the overall documentation when generated by javadoc.
x??

---
#### Example Javadoc Usage
Here is an example showing how to use Javadoc comments within a Java class.

:p What is shown in Example 15-1?
??x
Example 15-1 demonstrates the usage of various Javadoc keywords such as `@author`, `@throws`, and `@param` within a Java class. It also shows how to document methods, fields, and constructors using these comments.

```java
/**
 * Construct the GUI.
 * @throws java.lang.IllegalArgumentException if constructed on a Sunday.
 */
public JavadocDemo() {
    // Class body
}
```

This example highlights how to structure detailed documentation within a class to make it easier for other developers to understand its functionality and usage.

#### Javadoc - Command-Line Arguments and Customization
Javadoc provides a variety of command-line arguments to tailor the documentation process according to your needs. For personal use, you can link to standard JDK documentation using the `-link` option. If distributing the documentation, you can omit this or provide a URL to Oracle’s Java API page.
:p What is the purpose of the `-link` option in Javadoc?
??x
The `-link` option in Javadoc allows you to specify where your standard JDK documentation is installed. This ensures that links to standard Java classes are generated correctly, enhancing the readability and usefulness of your documentation.

For instance:
```sh
javadoc -link https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/ MyClass.java MyPackage
```
This command tells Javadoc to link to the specified URL when generating documentation for `MyClass.java` and the classes within `MyPackage`.

x??

#### Javadoc - Doclet Customization
Javadoc supports the use of custom Doclet classes, which can be used to extend or modify the behavior of the Javadoc tool. These doclets can serve as verifiers, converters from Java to other formats (like RTF), or any other type of utility you might require.
:p What is a Doclet in Javadoc?
??x
A Doclet in Javadoc is a custom class that allows for extending or modifying the functionality of the Javadoc tool. It can be used to perform various tasks such as verifying documentation, converting Java documentation to different formats like RTF, and more.

Here's an example of a simple Doclet:
```java
public class ExampleDoclet implements Doclet {
    public static int start(RootDoc root) {
        for (ClassDoc classDoc : root.classes()) {
            System.out.println("Class: " + classDoc.qualifiedName());
        }
        return 0;
    }

    public static boolean options(String[] args) {
        // Handle command-line arguments
        return true;
    }

    public static boolean version() {
        return false;
    }
}
```
This doclet prints out the names of all classes in a project.

#### Javadoc - Distribution and Online Help
For distributed documentation, Javadoc can either use a local installation of standard JDK documentation or link to an online URL. For end users, especially those interacting with GUI applications, JavaHelp is more suitable for providing interactive help.
:p What alternative does Javadoc have for end users of GUI applications?
??x
JavaHelp is designed as an alternative for end users of GUI applications, offering more interactive and user-friendly documentation compared to Javadoc. It provides a richer interface that includes searchable help and the ability to navigate through documentation in a more intuitive way.

For example:
```java
import javax.help.*;
import java.util.*;

public class HelpSystem {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HelpBroker hb = HelpBroker.findHelpBroker();
        hb.initialize(null, "helpsetfile.hlp", null);
        hb.showWindow("MyHelpSet");
    }
}
```
This code initializes and shows a help window using JavaHelp.

#### Javadoc - Online Tools Documentation
The official documentation for Javadoc includes extensive information on various command-line options, as well as examples of custom Doclet implementations. This resource is valuable for developers looking to customize or extend the functionality of Javadoc.
:p Where can one find detailed documentation and examples for Javadoc?
??x
Detailed documentation and examples for Javadoc are available in the official tools documentation that comes with the JDK. Additionally, you can visit Oracle’s website for more resources.

For example:
```sh
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/windows/javadoc.html
```
This URL leads to the official Javadoc documentation page where developers can find comprehensive information and examples.

#### Java Annotations/Metadata Introduction
Annotations, or metadata, were introduced to provide a mechanism for adding information to your source code that can be used at runtime. They are reminiscent of Javadoc tags but offer more structured and integrated functionality within the Java language.

:p What is an annotation in Java?
??x
An annotation in Java is a form of metadata that provides additional information about classes, methods, fields, parameters, and other program elements. This information can be used by tools at compile time or runtime to perform various tasks such as generating code, validating the code against specific rules, or providing alternative implementations.

```java
// Example of an annotation usage
@MyAnnotation(value = "example")
public class MyClass {
    // class body
}
```
x??

---

#### Annotations for Compiler Validation

Annotations can be used by the Java compiler to validate and provide extra information during compilation. For instance, the `@Override` annotation is used to indicate that a method is intended to override an inherited method.

:p How does the `@Override` annotation work?
??x
The `@Override` annotation in Java ensures that the programmer's intent to override a superclass method is correct and valid. If you attempt to use this annotation on a method that does not actually exist or cannot be overridden, the compiler will issue an error.

```java
public class MyObject {
    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj) { // Correct usage
        ...
    }
}

// Incorrect usage without `@Override`
public class MyObject {
    public boolean equals(MyClass obj) {  // Error: Cannot override because of different parameter type
        ...
    }
}
```

#### Runtime Access to Annotations

Annotations can be accessed at runtime using the Java Reflection API. This allows for dynamic inspection and manipulation of classes, fields, methods, etc.

:p How can annotations be read at runtime?
??x
Annotations can be read at runtime through the Java Reflection API. You can use reflection to access metadata such as method names, parameter types, and custom annotations defined in your code. For example, you can use `Method.getAnnotation()` to retrieve an annotation associated with a method.

```java
public class Example {
    @MyAnnotation(value = "example")
    public void myMethod() {}

    public static void main(String[] args) throws NoSuchMethodException {
        Method method = Example.class.getMethod("myMethod");
        MyAnnotation annotation = method.getAnnotation(MyAnnotation.class);
        if (annotation != null) {
            System.out.println(annotation.value());
        }
    }
}
```
x??

#### Custom Annotations

Developers can define their own custom annotations by using the `@interface` keyword. These annotations can be used to mark elements of code, and they can also have value parameters.

:p How do you create a custom annotation in Java?
??x
To create a custom annotation in Java, you use the `@interface` keyword followed by the name of your annotation. Annotations default to `@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)` unless specified otherwise. They can include methods (which are treated as fields with a default value) or enum constants.

```java
import java.lang.annotation.ElementType;
import java.lang.annotation.Retention;
import java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy;
import java.lang.annotation.Target;

@Target(ElementType.METHOD)
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
public @interface MyAnnotation {
    String value() default "";
}
```
