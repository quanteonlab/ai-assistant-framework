#### Army Line Scores Calculation

Background context: The U.S. Army uses ten separate line scores calculated from various ASVAB subtest scores, which help in determining eligibility for different jobs.

:p How are the Army's line scores computed?
??x
The Army combines various standard ASVAB scores into ten distinct areas by adding them up:
- **Clerical (CL):** VE + AR + MK
- **Combat (CO):** AR + CS + AS + MC
- **Electronics (EL):** GS + AR + MK + EI

For example, to compute the Clerical line score for a recruit:
```java
int clericalLineScore = verbalExpression + arithmeticReasoning + mathematicsKnowledge;
```
Here, `verbalExpression`, `arithmeticReasoning`, and `mathematicsKnowledge` are the actual ASVAB subtest scores.

#### Navy and Coast Guard Line Scores

Background context: The U.S. Navy and Coast Guard use their line scores directly as ASVAB subtest scores to provide a snapshot of broad career areas that recruits may qualify for.

:p How does the Navy or Coast Guard compute its line scores?
??x
The Navy and Coast Guard use the following formula:
- **Engineman (ENG):** AS + MK
- **Administrative (ADM):** MK + VE
- **General Technical (GT):** AR + VE

For example, to calculate the Administrative line score for a recruit:
```java
int administrativeLineScore = mathematicsKnowledge + verbalExpression;
```
Here, `mathematicsKnowledge` and `verbalExpression` are the actual ASVAB subtest scores.

#### Differentiating Between Line Scores

Background context: The Army's line scores are distinct from those used by other branches of the military. Each branch uses different combinations of ASVAB subtests to determine job eligibility.

:p How do the Army and Navy/Coast Guard differ in their use of line scores?
??x
The main difference lies in how the line scores are calculated:
- **Army:** Computes ten separate line scores from various combinations of ASVAB subtest scores.
- **Navy and Coast Guard:** Use individual subtest scores directly for broad career area assessments.

For example, to compute the Army's Combat line score:
```java
int combatLineScore = arithmeticReasoning + codingSpeed + autoAndShopInformation + mechanicalComprehension;
```
In contrast, a Navy recruit with similar scores would have their total Verbal Expression and Arithmetic Reasoning combined for relevant career areas.

#### Air Force MAGE Scores
The U.S. Air Force uses standard scores from the ASVAB subtests to derive scaled scores in four aptitude areas: Mechanical (M), Administrative (A), General (G), and Electronics (E). These scores are calculated as percentiles, which show your relative performance compared to a norm group.

:p What is the formula used by the Air Force to calculate the MAGE scores?
??x
The Air Force calculates MAGE scores using percentile ranks. For example, if a candidate has an Administrative (A) score of 51, it means they scored better than 50% of those who took the test.

```java
// Example Java code to convert subtest scores into percentiles for A and G aptitudes
public class AirForceMAGEScores {
    public int calculateAdministrativeScore(int numericalOperations, int codingSpeed) {
        return (numericalOperations + codingSpeed);
    }

    public int calculateGeneralAptitudeScore(int arithmeticReasoning, int verbalExpression) {
        return (arithmeticReasoning + verbalExpression);
    }
}
```
