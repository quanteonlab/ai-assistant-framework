$$2x + (x + 5) = 50$$

Simplifying and solving for $x$:

$$3x + 5 = 50$$
$$3x = 45$$
$$x = 15$$

The length of the third side is $x + 5 = 20$ feet.
x??

Let $x $ represent the measure of one of the two equal angles. Therefore, the other equal angle would also be$x $. The fourth angle would then be$2x$. Using the fact that the sum of the angles is 360°:

$$x + x + 2x = 360^\circ$$
$$4x = 360^\circ$$
$$x = 90^\circ$$

Thus, the measurements are $90^\circ $, $90^\circ $, and $180^\circ $(since $2x = 180^\circ$).
x??

:p What is the size of Angie's slice if Sadie’s piece is $x$ degrees?
??x
Let $x $ represent the measure of Sadie’s piece. Angie’s piece would then be$2x$. The total for all slices in a half-circle pizza (180°) can be expressed as:

$$x + 2x + 30^\circ = 180^\circ$$

Solving this equation:
$$3x + 30^\circ = 180^\circ$$
$$3x = 150^\circ$$
$$x = 50^\circ$$

So, Angie’s slice is $2x = 100^\circ$.
x??

---

#### Supplementary Angles
Background context: The problem involves supplementary angles that add up to 180°. One angle is represented by $x$, and the other is twice as large.

:p What are the measurements of both angles if one angle measures $x$?
??x
Let $x $ represent the measure of the first angle. Therefore, the second angle would be$2x$. Since these angles are supplementary:

$$x + 2x = 180^\circ$$

Solving this equation:
$$3x = 180^\circ$$
$$x = 60^\circ$$

So, the first angle measures $60^\circ $, and the second angle measures $2x = 120^\circ$.
x??

#### Triangle Angle Ratio
Background context: The problem involves a right triangle with one angle being 90° and the other two acute angles in a specific ratio (1:3).

:p What is the measure of each angle in the right triangle?
??x
In a right triangle, one angle is always 90°. Let $x $ represent the measure of the smaller acute angle. Therefore, the larger acute angle would be$3x$. The sum of all angles in a triangle is 180°:

$$90^\circ + x + 3x = 180^\circ$$

Solving this equation:
$$4x + 90^\circ = 180^\circ$$
$$4x = 90^\circ$$
$$x = 22.5^\circ$$

Thus, the angles are $90^\circ $, $22.5^\circ $, and $67.5^\circ $(since $3x = 67.5^\circ$).
x??

#### Finding Angles by Tripling
Background context: This problem involves finding an angle that is three times another given angle. It requires basic arithmetic operations to multiply the angles and understand the properties of vertical angles.

:p The first angle is 22.5°, find the second angle which is triple the first.

The second angle can be found by multiplying the first angle by three:

$$\text{Second Angle} = 3 \times 22.5^\circ$$

This gives us:
$$\text{Second Angle} = 67.5^\circ$$

Thus, the answer is Choice (B).

Using $\pi = 3.14$:

$$A_{\text{quarter}} = \pi r^2 = 3.14 \times (0.4775)^2 = 0.715 \, \text{in}^2$$
$$

A_{\text{penny}} = \pi r^2 = 3.14 \times (0.375)^2 = 0.441 \, \text{in}^2$$

The difference in area is:
$$

B = A_{\text{quarter}} - A_{\text{penny}} = 0.715 - 0.441 = 0.274 \, \text{in}^2$$

Thus, the answer is approximately $0.274$ in².

$$A = \frac{(24 + 36) \times 10}{2} = \frac{60 \times 10}{2} = \frac{600}{2} = 300 \, \text{cm}^2$$

Thus, the area of the trapezoid is $300$ cm².

Substitute $r = 1.5 \, \text{cm}$ and use $\pi \approx 3.14$:

$$C = 2 \times 3.14 \times 1.5 = 9.42 \, \text{cm}$$

Thus, the circumference of the circle is $9.42$ cm.

$$SA = 2(ab + bc + ac)$$

Substitute $a = 10 \, \text{in.}$,$ b = 2 \, \text{in.}$, and $ c = 3 \, \text{in.}$:

$$SA = 2(10 \times 2 + 2 \times 3 + 10 \times 3) = 2(20 + 6 + 30) = 2 \times 56 = 112 \, \text{in.}^2$$

Thus, the surface area of the prism is $112$ in².

$$A_{\text{large}} = \pi r^2 = 3.14 \times (4)^2 = 50.24 \, \text{cm}^2$$

For the smaller circle:
$$

A_{\text{small}} = \pi r^2 = 3.14 \times (2)^2 = 12.56 \, \text{cm}^2$$

The difference in area is:
$$

Thus, the answer is $37.68$ cm².

:p What are the two main types of skills required for Arithmetic Reasoning?
??x
The two main types of skills required are arithmetic, involving performing calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and reasoning, which involves figuring out which formulas and numbers to use in your calculations.

#### Example Problem Structure
Background context: Problems often present a real-world scenario that requires you to perform arithmetic operations. For instance, "How many miles per gallon does your brand-new SUV get?"

:p What is an example of a problem structure in Arithmetic Reasoning?
??x
An example problem structure might be: "Your brand-new SUV gets 20 gallons of gas and travels 400 miles on a full tank. How many miles per gallon does the SUV get?" You need to use arithmetic operations (division) to find the answer.

#### Sample Question
Background context: Solving life's little math problems requires understanding the problem, identifying what is being asked, and performing the necessary calculations.

:p What general strategy should you follow when solving Arithmetic Reasoning questions?
??x
When solving Arithmetic Reasoning questions, follow these steps:
1. Read the problem carefully to understand the situation.
2. Identify what information is given and what needs to be found.
3. Set up any equations or formulas needed based on the problem.
4. Perform the arithmetic operations correctly.
5. Check your answer against the question to ensure it makes sense.

For example, if you are given: "If a car travels 120 miles in 3 hours, what is its average speed?" You need to use division (distance divided by time) to find the answer.

#### Practice with Pseudocode
Background context: Using pseudocode can help clarify the problem and ensure accurate calculations.

:p How can you use pseudocode to solve a word problem?
??x
You can use pseudocode to break down the problem and perform the necessary calculations step by step. For example, for the problem "If a car travels 120 miles in 3 hours, what is its average speed?" the pseudocode might look like this:

```pseudocode
// Problem: Calculate the average speed of a car that travels 120 miles in 3 hours.
// Step 1: Define the distance and time variables.
distance = 120 // miles
time = 3       // hours

// Step 2: Use the formula for average speed: average_speed = distance / time
average_speed = distance / time

// Output the result
print(average_speed)
```

This pseudocode helps you understand and perform the necessary arithmetic operations.
