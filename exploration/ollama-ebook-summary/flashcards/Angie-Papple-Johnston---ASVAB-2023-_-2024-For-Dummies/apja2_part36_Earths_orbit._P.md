??x
To determine the correct way to assemble a set of interlocking pieces, start by identifying unique or key features on each piece that indicate their position relative to other pieces. Look for matching shapes, colors, or notches that must align correctly.

For example, if you have puzzle pieces labeled A, B, C, and D, and you know:
- Piece A fits with B
- Piece B also fits with C
- Piece C fits with both A and D

You would start by identifying the connections and ensuring each piece is placed in a way that maintains these connections.

This process can be broken down into steps:

1. Identify all unique features on each piece.
2. Determine which pieces fit together based on those features.
3. Place the pieces in order, ensuring they connect correctly.

```java
public class Puzzle {
    private String[] features;
    
    public Puzzle(String... features) {
        this.features = features;
    }
    
    public boolean fitsWith(Puzzle otherPuzzle) {
        // Check if current puzzle piece can fit with another based on shared features
        for (int i = 0; i < features.length; i++) {
            if (otherPuzzle.features[i].equals(features[i])) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
