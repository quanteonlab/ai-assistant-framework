#### ASVAB Score Types and Interpretation
Background context: The ASVAB provides multiple scores, including raw scores, standard scores, and others. Raw scores are the number of correct answers for each subtest. Standard scores use a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10.
:p What types of scores does the ASVAB provide?
??x
The ASVAB provides several types of scores, including raw scores (total points on each subtest) and standard scores (converted based on a distribution with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10).
x??

---

#### Raw Scores vs. Standard Scores
Background context: Raw scores are the straightforward tally of correct answers per subtest. However, these raw scores are not directly reported; they are used to calculate other scores like standard scores.
:p How do raw scores contribute to ASVAB scoring?
??x
Raw scores represent the number of questions you answered correctly on each subtest of the ASVAB. Although your actual raw scores aren't shown, they are crucial for calculating the standard scores and other metrics.
x??

---

#### Standard Score Interpretation
Background context: Standard scores are used to compare performance against a national norm. They have a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. This means an average score is around 50, while above-average scores range from 60 onwards.
:p How do standard scores differ from typical school test scores?
??x
Standard scores on the ASVAB differ from typical school test scores in that they use a different scale and distribution. Standard scores have a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10, whereas school tests often range from 1 to 100 with most students scoring between 70 and 100.

#### Verbal Expression (VE) Score Calculation

To understand how to calculate your VE score, it's important to know that this score is derived from your Word Knowledge and Paragraph Comprehension scores. First, you add these two scores together: 
\[ \text{VE Score} = \text{Word Knowledge Score} + \text{Paragraph Comprehension Score} \]

Next, you convert the resulting sum into a scaled score ranging from 20 to 62.

:p How do you calculate your VE score?
??x
To calculate your VE score, add your Word Knowledge score and Paragraph Comprehension score together. This sum is then converted to a scaled score between 20 and 62.
x??

---

#### Raw AFQT Score Calculation

The raw AFQT score is calculated using the following equation:
\[ \text{Raw AFQT Score} = 2 \times \text{VE Score} + \text{AR Score} + \text{MK Score} \]

Where VE, AR, and MK represent your scores in Verbal Expression, Arithmetic Reasoning, and Mathematics Knowledge respectively.

:p How do you calculate the raw AFQT score?
??x
To calculate the raw AFQT score, first double your VE score. Then add your Arithmetic Reasoning (AR) score and your Mathematics Knowledge (MK) score to this result.
