**Starting Chapter:** Assembling Objects Practice Questions

---

---
#### Checking Shapes Orientation
In the Assembling Objects subtest, you can improve your chances of answering correctly by focusing on a single shape from the first drawing and then looking for it in each of the answer choices but with different orientations. This helps quickly eliminate obviously wrong options.

:p How can you use one piece to check other pieces' orientation during the Assembling Objects test?
??x
By selecting just one shape from the first drawing, you can quickly look at each of the choices to see if that specific shape is represented there but in a different orientation. This helps you eliminate answer choices that are obviously wrong.

#### Dot Position Analysis
For connection-type problems, note the position of the dot on one of the shapes in the first drawing and then scan possible answers, eliminating any choice where the dot or line passing through the shape is depicted at a different point than shown in the first drawing.

:p How should you approach analyzing dots and lines for correct connections in Assembling Objects?
??x
First, observe the position of a key dot on one shape from the initial drawing. Then, quickly scan the possible answers; eliminate any choice where the dot or line passing through the shape is at a different location compared to the first drawing.

#### Mirror Image Awareness
Mirror images are shapes that are reflected instead of rotated and can be used by test-makers as trick questions. Be aware of such reflections.

:p What should you watch out for in Assembling Objects questions regarding mirror images?
??x
Be cautious of mirror images, which are shapes that appear reflected rather than just rotated from the image shown in the first drawing. Test-makers often use these to deceive your eyes.
