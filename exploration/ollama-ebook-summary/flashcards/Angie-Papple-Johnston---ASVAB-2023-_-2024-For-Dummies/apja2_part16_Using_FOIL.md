**Starting Chapter:** Using FOIL

---

#### Solving One-Step Equations Involving Addition and Subtraction
Background context: When solving equations involving addition or subtraction, the goal is to isolate the variable on one side of the equation. This often involves performing inverse operations such as subtracting a number from both sides if it was added.

:p How do you solve \( x + 47,432 = 50,000 \)?
??x
To solve this equation, perform the inverse operation of addition by subtracting 47,432 from both sides:
\[ x + 47,432 - 47,432 = 50,000 - 47,432 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ x = 2,568 \]

To verify the solution, substitute \( x = 2,568 \) back into the original equation:
\[ 2,568 + 47,432 = 50,000 \]
The answer is correct as both sides are equal.

#### Solving One-Step Equations Involving Multiplication and Division
Background context: When solving equations involving multiplication or division, the goal is to isolate the variable. The inverse operation of multiplication is division, which can be represented using a fraction bar in algebraic expressions.

:p How do you solve \( 6x = -36 \)?
??x
To solve this equation, perform the inverse operation of multiplication by dividing both sides by 6:
\[ \frac{6x}{6} = \frac{-36}{6} \]
This simplifies to:
\[ x = -6 \]

To verify the solution, substitute \( x = -6 \) back into the original equation:
\[ 6(-6) = -36 \]
The answer is correct as both sides are equal.

---

#### Solving Multi-Step Equations
Background context: Multi-step equations require performing multiple inverse operations to isolate the variable. The goal is to get the variable on one side of the equation by moving terms from one side to another and using appropriate inverse operations like subtraction or addition, followed by division or multiplication.

:p How do you solve \( 3x + x = 9 \)?
??x
First, combine like terms:
\[ 3x + x = 4x \]
The equation now is:
\[ 4x = 9 \]

Next, perform the inverse operation of multiplication by dividing both sides by 4:
\[ \frac{4x}{4} = \frac{9}{4} \]
This simplifies to:
\[ x = \frac{9}{4} \]

To verify the solution, substitute \( x = \frac{9}{4} \) back into the original equation:
\[ 3\left(\frac{9}{4}\right) + \frac{9}{4} = \frac{27}{4} + \frac{9}{4} = \frac{36}{4} = 9 \]
The answer is correct as both sides are equal.

#### Simplifying Algebraic Expressions
Background context: Before evaluating or solving algebraic expressions, it's essential to simplify them. Simplification involves removing parentheses using the distributive property, combining like terms, and combining constants.

:p How do you simplify \( 3x^2 + 4 - (2x^2 + x) \)?
??x
First, remove the parentheses by distributing the negative sign:
\[ 3x^2 + 4 - 2x^2 - x \]

Combine like terms. The \( x^2 \) terms are \( 3x^2 \) and \( -2x^2 \), which combine to give \( x^2 \):
\[ (3x^2 - 2x^2) + 4 - x = x^2 + 4 - x \]

The simplified expression is:
\[ x^2 - x + 4 \]

To verify, check if substituting values into the original and simplified expressions gives the same result. For example, let \( x = 1 \):
Original: \( 3(1)^2 + 4 - (2(1)^2 + 1) = 3 + 4 - (2 + 1) = 7 - 3 = 4 \)
Simplified: \( 1^2 - 1 + 4 = 1 - 1 + 4 = 4 \)

The answers are the same, confirming the simplification is correct.

#### FOIL Method
Background context: The FOIL method is a mnemonic for multiplying two binomials. It stands for First, Outer, Inner, Last, which are the pairs of terms that need to be multiplied. This technique helps students remember how to distribute each term in one binomial across all terms in another binomial.
:p What does FOIL stand for and what does it help with?
??x
FOIL stands for First, Outer, Inner, Last, which refers to the four steps used to multiply two binomials. It helps students remember the order of multiplying each term in one binomial by every term in another binomial.

#### Tackling Two-Variable Equations
Background context: When dealing with two-variable equations, there are usually multiple solutions unless additional constraints or methods (like substitution or combining equations) are used. Linear systems involve exponents of 1 and can be solved using either method depending on the complexity of the system.
:p What is a linear system, and how is it different from other types of equations?
??x
A linear system involves two-variable equations where each variable has an exponent of 1. It differs from other types because its solutions are typically multiple points rather than just one value or no solution at all.
x??

---
#### Substitution Method for Two-Variable Equations
Background context: The substitution method is used when the system of equations is simple and one equation can easily be solved for one variable, which is then substituted into the other equation. This reduces the complexity and allows solving for both variables step-by-step.
:p How do you use the substitution method to solve a two-variable linear system?
??x
To use the substitution method, first, solve one of the equations for one variable in terms of the other. Then substitute this expression into the second equation to find the value of the remaining variable. Finally, substitute back into either original equation to find the value of the first variable.
x??

---
#### Combining Equations Method
Background context: The combining method is used when the system of equations is more complex and requires adding or subtracting the equations to eliminate one variable and solve for the other. This often involves manipulating one or both equations before combining them.
:p How do you use the combining (elimination) method to solve a two-variable linear system?
??x
To use the combining method, align the equations so that like terms are in columns. Multiply one or both equations by constants to make the coefficients of one variable opposites. Then add the equations together to eliminate one variable and solve for the other. Substitute this value back into one of the original equations to find the remaining variable.

#### Example Problem with FOIL
Background context: An example problem demonstrates how to use the FOIL method to multiply two binomials and simplify the result by combining like terms.
:p Apply the FOIL method to (x + 2)(x - 5) and simplify the expression?
??x
Using the FOIL method:
- First: \( x \cdot x = x^2 \)
- Outer: \( x \cdot (-5) = -5x \)
- Inner: \( 2 \cdot x = 2x \)
- Last: \( 2 \cdot (-5) = -10 \)

Combine these results and simplify:
\( x^2 - 5x + 2x - 10 = x^2 - 3x - 10 \)
??x
The expression simplifies to \( x^2 - 3x - 10 \).
x??

#### Example Problem with Substitution Method
Background context: An example problem shows how the substitution method can be used in a simple two-variable system of equations where one equation is easily solved for one variable.
:p Solve the following system using the substitution method:
\[ x + y = 3 \]
\[ xy = 7 \]
??x
First, solve \( x + y = 3 \) for \( y \):
\[ y = 3 - x \]

Substitute this expression into the second equation:
\[ x(3 - x) = 7 \]
\[ 3x - x^2 = 7 \]
\[ x^2 - 3x + 7 = 0 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 1 \] (by substituting and solving the quadratic equation)

Substitute \( x = 1 \) back into \( y = 3 - x \):
\[ y = 3 - 1 = 2 \]

Thus, \( x = 1 \) and \( y = 2 \).

#### Example Problem with Combining Equations
Background context: An example problem demonstrates how combining equations can be used to solve a more complex two-variable system of linear equations. This involves multiplying one equation by a constant to align coefficients for elimination.
:p Solve the following system using the combining method:
\[ 2x + 3y = 12 \]
\[ 4x - y = 9 \]
??x
First, multiply the second equation by 3 to make the coefficients of \( y \) opposites:
\[ 2x + 3y = 12 \]
\[ 12x - 3y = 27 \]

Add the two equations together to eliminate \( y \):
\[ (2x + 3y) + (12x - 3y) = 12 + 27 \]
\[ 14x = 39 \]
\[ x = \frac{39}{14} \]

Substitute \( x = \frac{39}{14} \) back into the first equation:
\[ 2\left(\frac{39}{14}\right) + 3y = 12 \]
\[ \frac{78}{14} + 3y = 12 \]
\[ \frac{39}{7} + 3y = 12 \]

Solve for \( y \):
\[ 3y = 12 - \frac{39}{7} \]
\[ 3y = \frac{84 - 39}{7} \]
\[ 3y = \frac{45}{7} \]
\[ y = \frac{15}{7} \]

Thus, \( x = \frac{39}{14} \) and \( y = \frac{15}{7} \).

#### Pulling Out the Greatest Common Factor
To factor an expression, you need to identify the greatest common factor (GCF) of all terms. This involves finding both numerical and variable components.

:p How do you find the greatest common factor in an algebraic expression?
??x To find the GCF, determine the highest number that evenly divides all constants and the lowest power of each variable.
x??

#### Example of Factoring with GCF
Let's consider the product \(4x^2y\) and \(2xy\).

:p How do you factor the given terms using their greatest common factor?
??x First, identify the GCF as 2x. Then, divide each term by the GCF: 
```java
public class FactorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num1 = 4;
        int num2 = 2;
        char var1 = 'x';
        char var2 = 'y';

        // Finding GCF
        int gcfNum = gcd(num1, num2);
        char gcfVar = var1; // Assuming x has the lower power

        System.out.println("Greatest Common Factor: " + gcfNum + gcfVar);

        // Dividing terms by GCF
        int term1Divided = num1 / gcfNum;
        int term2Divided = num2 / gcfNum;

        System.out.println("Factored Terms: " + term1Divided + "y" + gcfVar);
    }

    public static int gcd(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0) return a;
        return gcd(b, a % b);
    }
}
```
