#### Nervous System Overview
The nervous system controls and coordinates the body's activities, including movement, sensation, thinking, and behavior. It is composed of two main parts: the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS).

- **Central Nervous System**: Includes the brain and spinal cord.
- **Peripheral Nervous System**: Consists of all other neurons that are not part of the CNS.

The brain has several key regions:
- **Cerebrum**: Responsible for higher functions like thinking, hearing, seeing, and others.
- **Cerebellum**: Manages balance and muscle coordination.
- **Medulla**: Handles involuntary actions such as heartbeat.
- **Spinal Cord**: Acts as a highway for nerve impulses between the brain and organs.

:p What are the main components of the nervous system?
??x
The central nervous system (CNS) includes the brain and spinal cord, while the peripheral nervous system (PNS) encompasses all other neurons. The CNS has specific regions like the cerebrum, cerebellum, medulla, and spinal cord.

---
#### Blood Types
There are four main blood types: A, B, AB, and O. Each type can be positive or negative.

:p What determines the different blood types?
??x
Blood types are determined by specific antigens on red blood cells. The four main types are A, B, AB, and O. The positive or negative designation refers to the presence or absence of the Rh factor.
x??

---

---
#### Blood Types and Donations
Blood types are classified based on the presence or absence of certain antigens. The ABO system includes four main blood types: A, B, AB, and O. Each type also has a positive or negative indicator for the Rh factor.

Type O negative is considered the universal donor because its red blood cells lack both A and B antigens and do not have Rh antibodies, making it compatible with any other blood type. Type AB positive can receive any blood type due to the presence of both A and B antigens on its red blood cells but no corresponding antibodies.

:p What are the characteristics that make Type O negative and Type AB positive universal donors/recipient?
??x
Type O negative is a universal donor because it lacks A, B, and Rh antigens. It can be given to anyone regardless of their blood type. Type AB positive is a universal recipient as it has both A and B antigens but no corresponding antibodies, allowing it to receive any blood type.

```java
public class BloodType {
    public static String determineUniversalDonor() {
        return "O negative"; // Since O negative can donate to anyone.
    }

    public static String determineUniversalRecipient() {
        return "AB positive"; // AB positive can receive from anyone.
    }
}
```

#### Renal System and Its Functions
The renal system includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. These organs work together to filter blood and produce urine, maintaining homeostasis by excreting excess minerals and regulating blood pressure.

:p What are the primary components of the renal system and their main functions?
??x
The renal system consists of:
- **Kidneys**: Filter blood to remove waste products.
- **Ureters**: Transport urine from the kidneys to the bladder.
- **Bladder**: Stores urine until it is expelled from the body.
- **Urethra**: The pathway through which urine leaves the body.

```java
public class RenalSystem {
    public static void filterBlood() {
        // Code for filtering blood in the kidneys.
    }

    public static void transportUrineToBladder() {
        // Code for ureters to move urine from kidneys to bladder.
    }

    public static void storeUrine() {
        // Code for storing urine in the bladder.
    }

    public static void expelUrineFromBody() {
        // Code for urine exiting through the urethra.
    }
}
```

#### Respiration Process
Respiration involves bringing oxygen into the body and expelling carbon dioxide. The process begins at the nose or mouth, where air is filtered, warmed, and moistened before entering the lungs.

:p What are the main steps involved in the respiration process?
??x
The main steps of the respiration process include:
1. **Inhalation**: Chest cavity expands to draw air into the lungs.
2. **Filtering Air**: Nasal cavity filters, warms, and moistens air; pharynx catches pathogens; epiglottis prevents food from entering the trachea.
3. **Air Transport**: Air travels through the trachea (below the larynx) to the bronchi in the lungs.
4. **Oxygen Absorption**: Air reaches alveoli, where oxygen diffuses into the bloodstream.

```java
public class Respiration {
    public static void inhale() {
        // Code for chest cavity expansion and air intake through nose or mouth.
    }

    public static void filterAir() {
        // Code for nasal cavity filtering, warming, and moistening air.
    }

    public static void transportAirToLungs() {
        // Code for trachea transporting air to bronchi.
    }

    public static void absorbOxygen() {
        // Code for oxygen diffusion into the bloodstream in alveoli.
    }
}
```

#### Digestive System Overview
The digestive system breaks down food into components that can be used by the body. It starts with salivation when food is thought about, followed by mechanical and chemical breakdown through chewing and stomach acids.

:p What are the key steps involved in digestion, starting from the moment you think about eating?
??x
Key steps in the digestive process include:
1. **Saliva Production**: Salivary glands produce saliva which starts breaking down starches.
2. **Mastication (Chewing)**: Teeth break food into smaller pieces.
3. **Esophageal Transport**: Swallowed food moves through the esophagus via peristalsis.
4. **Stomach Processing**: Gastric acids and enzymes further break down food in the stomach.
5. **Small Intestine Breakdown**: Pancreatic and liver enzymes complete digestion, converting fats, carbs, and proteins into useful substances.
6. **Large Intestine Reabsorption**: Water and minerals are absorbed here.
7. **Rectal Storage and Excretion**: Solid waste remains in the rectum until it is expelled.

```java
public class Digestion {
    public static void produceSaliva() {
        // Code for saliva production to start breaking down food.
    }

    public static void masticateFood() {
        // Code for teeth breaking down food into smaller pieces.
    }

    public static void transportThroughEsophagus() {
        // Code for esophageal peristalsis pushing food.
    }

    public static void stomachProcessing() {
        // Code for gastric acids and enzymes breaking down food.
    }

    public static void smallIntestineBreakdown() {
        // Code for further breakdown by pancreatic and liver enzymes.
    }

    public static void largeIntestineReabsorption() {
        // Code for reabsorbing water and minerals.
    }

    public static void evacuateWaste() {
        // Code for expelling solid waste through the rectum.
    }
}
```
