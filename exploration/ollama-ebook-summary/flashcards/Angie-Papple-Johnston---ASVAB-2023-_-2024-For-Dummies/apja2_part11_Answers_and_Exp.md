#### Algebraic Equations
Algebra will involve solving equations and inequalities, which require understanding variables and constants. You'll need to isolate the variable on one side of the equation.

:p What is the first step in solving a linear equation like \( x + 5 = 12 \)?
??x
The first step in solving this equation is to isolate the variable \( x \). Subtract 5 from both sides:
\( x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5 \)
Simplify:
\( x = 7 \)

The formula for the area of a rectangle is:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

For example:
If length = 10 units and width = 5 units, then:
\[ \text{Area} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ square units} \]

3. **Plan**: Choose appropriate operations or formulas based on the context.
4. **Solve**: Perform the calculations.
5. **Check**: Verify your answer by substituting it back into the problem.

For example, if a problem states: "John has 10 apples and gives away 4. How many does he have left?"
- Understand: John’s initial number of apples and what is happening (giving away).
- Identify: Initial amount = 10, given away = 4.
- Plan: Use subtraction since you are finding the difference.
- Solve: \( 10 - 4 = 6 \)
- Check: Verify that giving away 4 from 10 leaves John with 6 apples.

#### Inverse Operations

Inverse operations are used to undo each other. For addition and subtraction, the inverse of addition is subtraction, and vice versa. Similarly, multiplication and division have inverses as well.

:p What are inverse operations?
??x
Inverse operations are mathematical processes that reverse each other:
- The additive inverse (opposite) of addition is subtraction.
- The multiplicative inverse (reciprocal) of multiplication is division.
For example, if you add 3 to a number and get 8, subtracting 3 from 8 will give you the original number. Similarly, dividing by 4 undoes multiplying by 4.
x??

---

#### Multiplicative Inverse and Reciprocals
The multiplicative inverse of a number is its reciprocal, which means turning the number upside down. The reciprocal of \( x \) is given by \( \frac{1}{x} \). For example, the reciprocal of \( 5 \) is \( \frac{1}{5} \), and it can also be written as just \( 0.2 \).

:p What is the multiplicative inverse of a number?

#### Order of Operations
Order of operations refers to the sequence in which mathematical operations should be performed. The acronym PEMDAS (Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally) helps remember this order: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction.

:p What is the correct order of operations for solving a math problem?
??x
The correct order of operations for solving a math problem is as follows:
1. Perform calculations inside parentheses first.
2. Evaluate exponents next.
3. Carry out multiplication and division from left to right.
4. Finally, perform addition and subtraction from left to right.

For example, in the equation \( 3 \times (5 + 2) - 6^2 + 8 \), you would:
1. Solve inside the parentheses: \( 5 + 2 = 7 \).
2. Evaluate the exponent: \( 6^2 = 36 \).
3. Multiply: \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \).
4. Subtract and add from left to right: \( 21 - 36 + 8 \).

The final result is \( -7 \). This order ensures that the correct answer is obtained.
x??

---

#### Problem-Solving with Order of Operations
To solve a problem like \( 3 \times (5 + 2) - 6^2 + 8 \), you follow these steps:

1. **Parentheses**: Solve inside the parentheses first: \( 5 + 2 = 7 \).
2. **Exponents**: Evaluate any exponents next: \( 6^2 = 36 \).
3. **Multiplication and Division**: Perform multiplication from left to right: \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \).
4. **Addition and Subtraction**: Finally, perform addition and subtraction from left to right: \( 21 - 36 + 8 \).

:p What is the solution for the problem \( 3 \times (5 + 2) - 6^2 + 8 \)?
??x
The solution for the problem \( 3 \times (5 + 2) - 6^2 + 8 \) involves following these steps:
1. Solve inside the parentheses: \( 5 + 2 = 7 \).
2. Evaluate the exponent: \( 6^2 = 36 \).
3. Multiply: \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \).
4. Subtract and add from left to right: \( 21 - 36 + 8 \).

The final result is \( -7 \). This ensures that the operations are performed correctly according to the order of operations.

#### Completing Number Sequences
Number sequences test your ability to determine the next number in a series by identifying patterns. Common patterns include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.

:p How do you solve a number sequence problem like 2, 4, 16, 256, ...?
??x
To solve a number sequence problem like \( 2, 4, 16, 256, \ldots \), identify the pattern:
- The first term is \( 2^1 = 2 \).
- The second term is \( 2^2 = 4 \).
- The third term is \( 2^4 = 16 \) (not \( 2^3 = 8 \)).
- The fourth term is \( 2^8 = 256 \).

The pattern seems to involve exponentiation where the exponent doubles each time: \( 1, 2, 4, 8, \ldots \). Therefore, the next exponent would be \( 16 \), so the next number in the sequence is \( 2^{16} = 65,536 \).

The answer is \( 65,536 \).
x??

---

#### Arithmetic and Reasoning
Arithmetic reasoning questions often test your ability to determine how numbers relate to each other. These problems require quick arithmetic skills.

:p How do you solve a sequence problem like 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, ...?
??x
To solve the sequence \( 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, \ldots \), identify the pattern:
- The first term is \( 1 \).
- The second term is \( 1 + 1 = 2 \).
- The third term is \( 2 + 1 = 3 \).
- The fourth term is \( 3 + 3 = 6 \) (doubling the previous difference: \( 2 - 1 = 1 \), then \( 3 - 2 = 1 \)).
- The fifth term is \( 6 + 6 = 12 \).

The pattern involves adding the previous number plus the increment of the last addition. Therefore, the next step would be to add 12 (the previous number) plus 6 (the difference), which gives \( 12 + 6 = 18 \).

Thus, the next number in the sequence is \( 24 \).
