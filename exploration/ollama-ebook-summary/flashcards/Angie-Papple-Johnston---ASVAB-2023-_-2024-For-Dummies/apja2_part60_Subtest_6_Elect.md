---
#### Lever Arm Balance
In a lever system, when two weights are balanced on an arm, they create moments about a fulcrum. The moment (torque) is calculated as the product of force and distance from the fulcrum.
:p If cherries are removed from Basket B, to rebalance the arm, what action must be taken?
??x
To rebalance the arm after removing cherries from Basket B, Basket A will have to be moved to the right. This increases its moment (torque) relative to the fulcrum, balancing out the reduced moment on Basket B.
x??

---
#### Gear Ratio and Linear Distance
When two gears are meshed together, their linear distance traveled is inversely proportional to their number of teeth. If both gears revolve at the same rate but have different numbers of teeth, the gear with fewer teeth will travel a greater linear distance in the same amount of time.
:p If Wheel A and Wheel B revolve at the same rate, which wheel covers more linear distance?
??x
If both wheels revolve at the same rate but Wheel A has fewer teeth than Wheel B, it will cover a linear distance faster. Given that Wheel A covers 12 feet in this scenario, and assuming it has fewer teeth, it means it is moving faster.

#### Pressure Calculation
Pressure (P) is calculated as force (F) divided by area (A). This formula P = F / A can be used to determine the pressure exerted by a given force over a specific area.
:p If a force of 200 pounds is exerted over an area of 10 square inches, what's the pressure in psi?
??x
The pressure (P) would be calculated as P = F / A. Given that F = 200 pounds and A = 10 square inches:
```java
double force = 200; // pounds
double area = 10;   // square inches
double pressure = force / area; // psi
```
So, the pressure is 20 psi.
x??

---
#### Seesaw Dynamics
In a seesaw setup (lever), when two weights are placed at different distances from the fulcrum, the weight that is closer to the fulcrum will exert more torque. The position of the weights relative to the fulcrum determines their effect on balance.
:p If you move Anvil A toward the middle of the seesaw, what happens to Anvil B?
??x
If you move Anvil A toward the middle of the seesaw, Anvil B will rise in the air. This is because moving Anvil A closer to the fulcrum decreases its torque, causing a net upward force on Anvil B.
x??

---
#### Ramp and Effort Calculation
The effort required to move an object up a ramp is given by the formula E = W * h / L, where E is the effort, W is the weight of the object, h is the height of the ramp, and L is the length of the ramp. This formula simplifies the task by reducing the force needed.
:p If a ramp measures 6 feet in length and 3 feet in height, an object weighing 200 pounds requires how much effort to move using the ramp?
??x
The effort required can be calculated as:
```java
double weight = 200; // pounds
double height = 3;   // feet
double length = 6;   // feet
double effort = (weight * height) / length;
```
So, the effort is 100 pounds.
x??

x??

---
#### Seesaw and Weight Distribution
In a seesaw, the weight on one side is balanced by the weight on the other side. If Side B's weight is removed, it affects the balance point on Side A.
:p If the weight is removed from Side B of the seesaw, what happens to the weight on Side A?
??x
If the weight is removed from Side B of the seesaw, the weight on Side A will move toward the ground. This occurs because the side with less weight (Side B) will cause a net upward force on Side A.
x??

---
#### Friction Concept
Friction is the force that resists the relative motion of solid surfaces, fluid layers, or material elements sliding against each other. It can be calculated using the formula F = μN, where F is the frictional force, μ is the coefficient of friction, and N is the normal force.
:p What causes objects to rub against each other?

#### Most Efficient Device for Lifting
Among the given devices (lever, inclined plane, fixed pulley, jackscrew), the most efficient device to use for lifting a heavy object vertically over a short distance is a fixed pulley.

:p Which device should be used to move a 400-pound crate from the floor of a warehouse to the bed of a truck 4 feet off the ground?
??x
The most efficient device to use for this task is a fixed pulley. While it doesn't reduce the force required, it changes the direction of the pull, making it easier to lift the crate.
x??

---
#### Engine Water Issues
Water in an engine can cause damage during winter because water expands when it freezes and can push open seals or crack components like pipes or radiators. This can lead to leaks or structural failures.
:p Why does water in an engine cause damage in winter weather?
??x
Water in an engine causes damage in winter weather because it expands when it freezes, pushing open seals or cracking components such as pipes or radiators.
x??

---
#### Anvil Weight Comparison
In a lever system where the load is supported by two anvils, the side with more weight will exert greater torque. If both scales are identical and read 24, then each anvil carries an equal amount of weight.
:p Which anvil is carrying the most weight?
??x
Both Anvil A and Anvil B are carrying an equal amount of weight. Since both scales read 24, it indicates that the weights on both sides are balanced.
x??

---
#### Block-and-Tackle Arrangement
A block-and-tackle system uses a combination of pulleys to lift heavy loads by dividing the load among multiple strands and reducing the effort required.
:p In a block-and-tackle arrangement, what part moves when lifting a load?
??x
In a block-and-tackle arrangement used to lift a load, all parts except the lower block remain stationary. The upper hook and block will move as the load is lifted.
x??

---
#### Effort Required in Block-and-Tackle
To calculate the effort required in a block-and-tackle system, consider that each rope strand reduces the force needed by half. If 7 strands are used, the effort required to lift a heavy object would be reduced proportionally.
:p What effort must be applied to lift an anvil using a block-and-tackle with 3 ropes?
??x
If 21.0 pounds is the total load and there are 3 ropes, the effort required per rope would be:
```java
double totalLoad = 21; // pounds
int strands = 3;
double effortPerStrand = totalLoad / strands;
```
So, 7.0 pounds must be applied to each strand.
x??

---
#### Cam and Valve Operation
A cam is a rounded piece that, as it rotates, pushes or pulls the attached valve in various directions. The number of times the valve opens per revolution depends on the profile and design of the cam.
:p For each complete revolution of the cam, how many times will the valve open?
??x
For each complete revolution of the cam, if the cam has a specific profile that allows for multiple contacts with the valve, it can cause the valve to open multiple times. The exact number depends on the design but is generally between 1 and several times per revolution.
x??

---
#### Seesaw Dynamics Recap
In a lever system (seesaw), when one side's weight is reduced or moved closer to the fulcrum, it creates an imbalance that causes the opposite side to rise.
:p If you move Anvil A toward the middle of the seesaw, what happens to Anvil B?
??x
If you move Anvil A toward the middle of the seesaw, Anvil B will rise in the air. This is because moving Anvil A closer to the fulcrum decreases its torque, causing a net upward force on Anvil B.
