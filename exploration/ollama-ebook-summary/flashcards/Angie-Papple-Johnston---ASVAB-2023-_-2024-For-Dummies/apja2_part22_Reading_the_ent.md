#### Digging for the Facts
Background context explaining that after identifying what the question is, you need to determine which data are relevant and which are not. List all facts provided in the problem with their units of measurement.

:p How do you identify relevant information in a word problem?
??x
List all the given information and variables from the problem on your scratch paper. Attach any units of measurement (e.g., miles, feet, inches). Then, cross out or ignore data that are not relevant to the question at hand.

For example:
- Tom sold 15 candy bars
- Becky sold 12 candy bars
- Debbie sold 17 candy bars
- Jane sold the most at 50

The question is: How many candy bars did Becky, Debbie, and Jane sell? Therefore, Tom's sales are irrelevant and can be crossed out.

The relevant facts are:
- Becky 12 bars
- Debbie 17 bars
- Jane 50 bars

Summing the remaining bars gives you the answer.

#### Example Problem: Volume Calculation
Background context explaining a specific example problem to calculate volume using the formula V = lwh (length x width x height).

:p How do you solve for the volume of a rectangular container?
??x
Use the formula V = lwh, where:
- V is the volume
- l is the length
- w is the width
- h is the height

Given dimensions: 12 inches long by 14 inches wide by 10 inches tall.
Calculate as follows:

```java
int length = 12;
int width = 14;
int height = 10;

int volume = length * width * height; // V = lwh
System.out.println("Volume: " + volume + " cubic inches");
```

The result is:
Volume: 1680 cubic inches.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 1,680 cubic inches.

??x
Identify and use clue words in the problem to understand what the question is asking. In this example, clue words like "contain" suggest that you need to calculate volume.

Given:
- A cardboard box measuring 12 inches long by 14 inches wide by 10 inches tall.
- The question: How many cubic inches of sand can a cardboard box containing these dimensions hold?

Use the formula V = lwh:

```java
int length = 12;
int width = 14;
int height = 10;

int volume = length * width * height; // V = lwh
System.out.println("Volume: " + volume + " cubic inches");
```

The result is:
Volume: 1680 cubic inches.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 1,680 cubic inches.

#### Setting Up and Solving Arithmetic Problems

Background context explaining the concept. The ASVAB often includes word problems that require you to set up equations and solve for unknowns using basic arithmetic skills.

If applicable, add code examples with explanations:
```java
public class SavingsProblem {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Define known variables
        int currentAge = 37;
        int goalAge = 40;
        double totalSavingsGoal = 15000.0;

        // Calculate the number of years to save
        int yearsToSave = goalAge - currentAge;

        // Define unknown variable (money needed per year)
        double annualSavingsRequired = totalSavingsGoal / yearsToSave;
        System.out.println("Joan needs to save $" + annualSavingsRequired + " each year.");
    }
}
```
:p How does the problem-solving approach work for Joan’s savings goal?
??x
The problem involves setting up and solving an equation based on given information. We know Joan wants to save $15,000 over a specific number of years to achieve her dream.

We first determine how many years she has to save:
- Current age: 37
- Goal age: 40

Therefore, the number of years \( y \) is calculated as follows:

\[
y = goalAge - currentAge = 40 - 37 = 3
\]

Next, we set up the equation where the total savings needed equals the annual savings multiplied by the number of years:
- Total Savings Goal: $15,000

We represent this as an equation:

\[
y \times m = \$15,000
\]

Substituting \( y = 3 \):

\[
3m = \$15,000
\]

To find the annual savings \( m \), we divide both sides by 3:

\[
m = \frac{\$15,000}{3} = \$5,000
\]

Therefore, Joan needs to save $5,000 each year for three years.

#### Isolating Unknowns in Equations

Background context explaining the concept. Sometimes, word problems require you to isolate unknown variables within equations.

If applicable, add code examples with explanations:
```java
public class IsolateUnknownExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double totalSavings = 15000.0;
        int yearsToSave = 3;

        // Calculate annual savings required
        double annualSavingsRequired = totalSavings / yearsToSave;
        System.out.println("Joan needs to save $" + annualSavingsRequired + " each year.");
    }
}
```
:p How do you isolate an unknown variable in the equation \( ym = \$15,000 \) when \( y = 3 \)?
??x
To solve for \( m \), we start with the equation:

\[
y \times m = \$15,000
\]

Given that \( y = 3 \):

\[
3 \times m = \$15,000
\]

We need to isolate \( m \). To do this, divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[
m = \frac{\$15,000}{3}
\]

Performing the division gives us:

\[
m = \$5,000
\]

So, Joan needs to save $5,000 each year.

#### Using Diagrams for Visualization

Background context explaining the concept. Visual aids can simplify complex problems by breaking them down into simpler components.

If applicable, add code examples with explanations:
```java
public class RoomDiagramExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Define dimensions of the room
        int side1 = 15;
        int side2 = 14;
        int side3 = 8;
        int side4 = 6;

        // Calculate total area to be tiled (assuming a six-sided room)
        double areaToTile = side1 * side2 + side3 * side4; // Simplified for example
        System.out.println("Total area to tile: " + areaToTile);
    }
}
```
:p How can drawing a diagram help solve the problem of tiling a room with irregular dimensions?
??x
Drawing a diagram helps visualize the space and simplifies calculations. For instance, if you are given a six-sided room with different side lengths:

- Side 1: 15 feet
- Side 2: 14 feet
- Side 3: 8 feet
- Side 4: 6 feet

A diagram can help break down the area into more manageable parts. In this case, we assume a simplified approach by calculating the area of two pairs of opposite sides:

\[
\text{Area to tile} = side1 \times side2 + side3 \times side4
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[
\text{Area to tile} = 15 \times 14 + 8 \times 6
\]

This visualization helps you understand that you need to calculate the area of each section separately and sum them up.

Therefore, the total area to be tiled is:

\[
15 \times 14 + 8 \times 6 = 210 + 48 = 258 \text{ square feet}
\]

This diagrammatic approach makes it easier to conceptualize and compute the required tiling area.

x??

---

#### Rounding Real-World Problems
Background context: In real-world scenarios, the rules for rounding differ from those taught in school. You often need to round up or down based on practical needs rather than mathematical conventions.

:p How does real-world rounding differ?
??x
In real-world problems, you might need to round up if a partial unit is needed (e.g., 2.2 cans of paint require 3 cans), and round down for breaks or other situations where partial units are not practical (e.g., only one break after 7 hours despite the mathematical rounding).
x??

---

#### Backtracking Steps
Background context: If your initial solution does not fit the facts presented in the problem, it is essential to backtrack through your steps until you arrive at a probable and correct answer.

:p What should you do if your answer seems incorrect?
??x
If your answer seems incorrect, back up and go through each step again. This process can help identify where you made a mistake and lead you to a more accurate solution that fits the problem’s context.
