#### Ruling Out Wrong Answers
Explanation on how to eliminate unlikely answers by comparing similar choices and using prefixes, suffixes, or root words.

:p How can you use the process of elimination to find the correct answer in a Word Knowledge question?
??x
You can rule out wrong answers by comparing similar choices and using your knowledge of prefixes, suffixes, or root words. For example, if "inhabit" means something like "live," you can eliminate options that mean the opposite (vacate, depart, leave).

#### Understanding Suffixes for Parts of Speech
Explanation on how to use suffixes to determine the part of speech and narrow down answer choices.

:p How do suffixes help in determining the correct meaning of a word?
??x
Suffixes can indicate whether a word is a noun (like -tion, -ment), verb (like -ate, -ify), or adjective (like -ous, -ic). For example, the suffix "-ous" usually modifies nouns and turns them into adjectives. If "analogous" ends in "-ous," it's likely an adjective.

#### Replacing Words with Choices
Explanation on how to substitute answer choices into the sentence to find the best fit.

:p How can substituting answer choices help determine the correct word meaning?
??x
Substituting each choice into the original sentence helps identify which one fits logically. For example, in "The CDC hasn’t been able to identify the pathogen that these people ingested before turning into zombies," you can replace "pathogen" with "person," "carrier," "event," or "bacteria." Only "bacteria" makes sense.

#### Parts of Speech and Sentence Structure
Explanation on how understanding parts of speech can help in determining the correct answer.

:p How do parts of speech influence the correct choice in a Word Knowledge question?
??x
Parts of speech are crucial because they define the role words play in sentences. For instance, if you're looking at a verb, only choices that describe an action (like "succeed") would fit correctly in a sentence like "Cameron knew that the only viable option was to invest 10 percent of his savings."

#### Deconstructing Words with Prefixes and Suffixes
Explanation on how breaking down words can help understand their meanings.

:p How can understanding prefixes and suffixes help in deciphering word meanings?
??x
Breaking down a word into its prefix, root, and suffix helps identify its meaning. For example, "de-" often means "away from" or "remove," as seen in "deform" (meaning to contort) where the root "form" relates to shape.

#### Multiple Strategies Combined
Explanation on how combining multiple strategies can improve accuracy.

:p How does combining different ASVAB test-taking strategies enhance your chances of answering correctly?
??x
Combining various strategies, such as ruling out wrong answers, substituting choices, and understanding parts of speech, can significantly improve your ability to find the correct answer. For example, in "Analogous most nearly means," you might first rule out nouns (danger) and verbs (write), then use the suffix "-ous" to narrow it down to "comparable."

#### Meaning of -able Suffix
Background context explaining that the suffix -able typically signifies "capable of." This is a common root form found in many English words, making it useful for guessing on the ASVAB.

:p What does the suffix -able usually signify?
??x
The suffix -able usually signifies "capable of," allowing you to guess the meaning of unfamiliar words by considering their context and the root word. For example:
- Approachable: capable of being approached or talked to.
- Serviceable: capable of being used for a particular purpose.
- Governable: capable of being controlled or managed.

#### Guessing Strategy on the ASVAB
Background context explaining that on the paper-and-pencil version, you can review and change your answers within a section, but not after time expires. On the computerized version (CAT-ASVAB), you cannot review or change answers once submitted.

:p What is the guessing strategy for the paper-and-pencil version of the ASVAB?
??x
On the paper-and-pencil version of the ASVAB, you can take your time to review and change your answers within each section. However, after the allotted time, you won't be able to go back and make changes. It's crucial to use this flexibility wisely.

Example: If running out of time is a concern, spend extra time on difficult questions but avoid guessing randomly unless you can eliminate some choices.

#### Guessing Strategy for CAT-ASVAB
Background context explaining that the computerized version (CAT-ASVAB) does not allow review or changes once answers are submitted. It's important to use test-taking strategies effectively, as there's no opportunity to revisit questions after submission.

:p What is the guessing strategy for the CAT-ASVAB?
??x
On the CAT-ASVAB, you cannot review or change your answers once submitted. Therefore, it’s crucial not to guess randomly if running out of time. Instead, focus on answering each question using the best strategies and information available at that moment.

Example: If time is limited, try to answer as many questions correctly as possible without rushing into guessing.

#### Time Management for CAT-ASVAB
Background context explaining the specific time limits and number of questions in the CAT-ASVAB. The test has a strict time limit, and you must manage your time effectively within each section.

:p How much time do I have to answer questions on the CAT-ASVAB?
??x
On the CAT-ASVAB, you have 9 minutes to answer 15 questions if there are no tryout questions. This means you should aim for about 36 seconds per question (if you check the math, refer to Chapter 6).

Example: 
```java
// Time management example
public class ASVABTimeManagement {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int totalQuestions = 15;
        int totalTimeInSeconds = 9 * 60; // 9 minutes converted to seconds
        double timePerQuestion = (double)totalTimeInSeconds / totalQuestions;

        System.out.println("Time per question: " + timePerQuestion + " seconds");
    }
}
```

#### Time Management for Paper-and-Pencil ASVAB
Background context explaining the specific time limits and number of questions in the paper-and-pencil version. The test allows more time but requires careful pacing to ensure all sections are completed.

:p How much time do I have to answer questions on the paper-and-pencil version?
??x
On the paper-and-pencil version of the ASVAB, you have 11 minutes to answer 35 questions. This means you should aim for about 18 seconds per question (refer back to Chapter 6 if needed).

Example: 
```java
// Time management example
public class ASVBPTimeManagement {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int totalQuestions = 35;
        int totalTimeInSeconds = 11 * 60; // 11 minutes converted to seconds
        double timePerQuestion = (double)totalTimeInSeconds / totalQuestions;

        System.out.println("Time per question: " + timePerQuestion + " seconds");
    }
}
```

#### Vocabulary Building and Test Strategies
Background context explaining that having an extensive vocabulary can help with the Word Knowledge subtest, but strategies are provided for those who may not have a large vocabulary.

:p How can you improve your vocabulary for the ASVAB?
??x
Improving your vocabulary for the ASVAB involves both long-term learning and short-term test-taking strategies. Long-term approaches include reading widely and consistently, using flashcards, and exposing yourself to new words daily. For the test itself, focus on eliminating obviously wrong choices first, as this can increase your chances of guessing correctly.

Example: Use a strategy where you quickly scan each answer choice and eliminate options that seem incorrect before making an educated guess.

#### The Importance of Reading for Vocabulary Building
Reading is a crucial activity to expand your vocabulary, especially in today's fast-paced digital age. Studies show that individuals who read for pleasure have significantly larger vocabularies compared to those who do not. This improvement stems from seeing words in print rather than just hearing them spoken.

:p Why is reading important for building a larger vocabulary?
??x
Reading is essential because it exposes you to the written form of words, which helps you understand their meanings and usage better than simply hearing them. Additionally, people can read and comprehend many more words than they would ever use in conversation.

#### Choosing Reading Material
To start improving your vocabulary, choose reading materials that are slightly above your current reading level but still interest you. Daily newspapers, news magazines, or any topic you find engaging are great starting points.

:p How should one begin building their vocabulary through reading?
??x
Begin by selecting reading material that interests you and is just a notch or two above what you usually read. This ensures engagement and comprehension while gradually expanding your knowledge.

#### Using Context to Understand Unknown Words
When encountering unfamiliar words, try to deduce their meanings from the context in which they are used. For example, if you come across "extrapolated" in a sentence like "The scientist extrapolated from the data," consider substituting known words to make sense of it.

:p How can you use context clues to understand unknown words?
??x
Use context clues by substituting familiar words for the unknown term. In the example, "The scientist extrapolated from the data," you might try replacing "extrapolated" with other verbs like "hid" or "used." The latter makes more sense in this sentence.
