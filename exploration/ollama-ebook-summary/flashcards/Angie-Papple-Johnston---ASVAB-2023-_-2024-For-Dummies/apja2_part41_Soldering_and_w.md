        // Simulate clamping process
        simulateClamp("material");
        System.out.println("Bench vise closed.");
    }

    private void simulateClamp(String material) {
        // Simulated method to show the clamping action
        System.out.println(material + " is securely clamped.");
    }
}
```

#### Nails: Measuring and Usage
Nail length is designated by the penny system, abbreviated with a "d". A 10-penny nail is a 10d nail. The higher the penny size, the longer the nail.

:p How are nails measured?
??x
- Nail lengths are measured using the penny system.
- 10d nails are ten-penny nails and measure approximately 1.25 inches in length.
- The higher the penny size, the longer the nail.
- Nails larger than 20d are called spikes and are measured in inches.

C/Java code is not directly applicable here, but for context:
```java
// Example of measuring nails using the penny system
public class NailMeasurement {
    public void measureNail() {
        // Simulate measuring a nail with a 10d designation
        System.out.println("Measuring 10d nail.");
        simulateMeasure();
    }

    private void simulateMeasure() {
        // Simulated method to show the measurement action
        System.out.println("The 10d nail measures approximately 1.25 inches in length.");
    }
}
```
