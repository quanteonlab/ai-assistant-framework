#### Simplifying Expressions Involving Exponents and Radicals
Background context: This concept involves simplifying algebraic expressions that include exponents, radicals, and basic arithmetic operations. It is important to understand the properties of exponents and how to manipulate them.

:p Simplify $25^2x$.
??x
The expression $25^2x $ can be simplified by recognizing that 25 is a perfect square (i.e.,$25 = 5^2 $). Therefore, $(5^2)^{2x} = 5^{4x}$.

: Simplify $5^2x$.
??x
The expression simplifies to $5^{2x}$, which means the base remains 5 and the exponent is multiplied by 2.

---
#### Solving Equations Involving Radicals
Background context: This involves solving equations that contain radical expressions. The key steps are isolating the radical, squaring both sides of the equation, and then solving for the variable.

:p Simplify $x^3$.
??x
The expression $x^3 $ is already in its simplest form unless additional context or constraints are provided. If you need to solve an equation like$\sqrt[3]{x} = k $, cube both sides to isolate x: $ x = k^3$.

: Solve for $x $ if$\sqrt{x} = 5$.
??x
Square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root:
$$(\sqrt{x})^2 = 5^2 \implies x = 25.$$---
#### Factoring Polynomials
Background context: Factoring polynomials involves breaking down a polynomial into simpler factors that, when multiplied together, give back the original polynomial. This is crucial for solving equations and simplifying expressions.

:p Factor $9x^2 + 18x$.
??x
To factor this expression, look for the greatest common factor (GCF) of the terms:
$$9x^2 + 18x = 9x(x + 2).$$: Factor $9x^2 - 18x$.
??x
Factor out the GCF from both terms:
$$9x^2 - 18x = 9x(x - 2).$$---
#### Solving Equations Involving Quadratic Forms
Background context: This involves solving equations that can be written in quadratic form, i.e., expressions like $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$. The goal is to find the values of x that satisfy the equation.

:p Solve for $x $ if$57 - 62 + 42 - 3x = 18$.
??x
First, simplify the left side:
$$57 - 62 + 42 - 3x = 37 - 3x.$$

Set this equal to 18 and solve for $x$:
$$37 - 3x = 18 \implies -3x = 18 - 37 \implies -3x = -19 \implies x = \frac{19}{3}.$$: Solve the equation $57 - 62 + 42 - 3x = 18 $ for$x$.
??x
The solution is:
$$x = \frac{19}{3}.$$---

$$r = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ inches}.$$

Use the formula for the area of a circle,$A = \pi r^2$:
$$A = \pi (5)^2 = 25\pi.$$: Calculate the volume of a cube with a side length of 4 inches.
??x
The volume $V$ of a cube is given by:
$$V = s^3,$$where $ s $is the side length. For this problem,$ s = 4$:
$$V = 4^3 = 64 \text{ cubic inches}.$$---

:p Evaluate the expression $6a^3x^2y $ if$a = 3 $, $ x = 7 $, and$ y = 4$.
??x
Substitute the given values into the expression:
$$6(3)^3(7)^2(4) = 6 \cdot 27 \cdot 49 \cdot 4.$$

Calculate step-by-step:
$$6 \cdot 27 = 162,$$
$$162 \cdot 49 = 7938,$$
$$7938 \cdot 4 = 31752.$$: Simplify $ x^3 $ if $ x = -2$.
??x
Substitute $x = -2$ into the expression:
\[

??x
The answer: the intake valve closes, and the piston moves to the top of the cylinder.
??x
During the compression stroke, the intake valve is closed, preventing additional air/fuel mixture from entering. The piston then rises, compressing the remaining fuel-air mixture, which is necessary for efficient combustion.
