#### Degrees, Minutes, and Seconds in Geometry
Background context: In geometry, angles are often measured in degrees. However, sometimes smaller units like minutes (′) and seconds (″) are used for more precise measurements. The relationship between these units is 1 degree = 60 minutes, and 1 minute = 60 seconds.
:p How are angles typically measured in geometry?
??x
Angles are generally measured using degrees (°), where 1 degree equals 60 minutes (′) and 1 minute equals 60 seconds (″). This system allows for precise angle measurements when necessary.

#### Perimeter of 2D Shapes
Background context: The perimeter is the distance around a shape, which for polygons can be calculated by adding the lengths of all sides. For a circle, the formula involves π (pi).

Formula:
- Rectangle: \(P = 2 \times (length + width)\)
- Circle: \(P = 2\pi r\) where \(r\) is the radius

:p What is the perimeter of a rectangle with length 10 units and width 5 units?
??x
The perimeter of the rectangle is calculated as follows:
\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) = 2 \times (10 + 5) = 30 \text{ units} \]
x??

---
#### Area of 2D Shapes
Background context: The area measures the flat space inside a shape. For rectangles and squares, it is length times width; for circles, it involves π.

Formula:
- Rectangle/Square: \(A = length \times width\)
- Circle: \(A = \pi r^2\) where \(r\) is the radius

:p What is the area of a circle with a radius of 4 units?
??x
The area of the circle can be calculated using the formula:
\[ A = \pi r^2 = \pi (4)^2 = 16\pi \text{ square units} \]
Approximating \(\pi\) as \(3.14\):
\[ A \approx 16 \times 3.14 = 50.24 \text{ square units} \]

#### Angles in Geometry
Background context: Angles are formed where two lines intersect, typically measured in degrees. Different types of angles have specific ranges and properties.

Types:
- Straight line: 180°
- Right angle: 90°
- Acute angle: \(0° < \theta < 90°\)
- Obtuse angle: \(90° < \theta < 180°\)
- Reflex angle: \(180° < \theta < 360°\)
- Complementary angles: Sum to 90°
- Supplementary angles: Sum to 180°

:p What is the definition of complementary and supplementary angles?
??x
Complementary angles are two angles that add up to exactly 90 degrees. For example, if one angle measures 30°, its complement would be 60° because \(30° + 60° = 90°\).

Supplementary angles are two angles that sum to 180 degrees. If one angle is 120°, the supplementary angle would be 60° since \(120° + 60° = 180°\).
x??

---
#### Vertical Angles
Background context: When two lines intersect, they form angles that are opposite each other and equal in measure.

:p What property do vertical angles share?
??x
Vertical angles always have the same measure. This means if angle a is \(45°\), then angle b (its vertical counterpart) will also be \(45°\).
x??

---
#### Parallel Lines with Transversal
Background context: When two parallel lines are intersected by another line called a transversal, it forms several pairs of angles that have specific relationships.

Types of Pairs:
- Corresponding Angles: On the same side of the transversal and on corresponding sides of the parallel lines. They are equal.
- Alternate Interior Angles: Between the two parallel lines but on opposite sides of the transversal. They are also equal.
- Alternate Exterior Angles: Outside the two parallel lines, on opposite sides of the transversal. These angles are equal as well.
- Consecutive Interior Angles: On the same side of the transversal and between the parallel lines. Their sum is 180 degrees.

:p What do corresponding angles have in common?
??x
Corresponding angles are on the same side of the transversal and both above or below the parallel lines. These angles always have equal measures if the lines are indeed parallel.
x??

---

#### Naming Angles
Angles can be named using various descriptors and labeling methods. Acute, obtuse, and complementary are some of the common descriptors used to describe angles based on their measure.

When naming angles by points, typically a label such as ABC (with C being the vertex) is used. The middle letter in this type of label denotes the vertex.
:p How do you name an angle with the vertex labeled?
??x
Angles are named using labels like ABC where A and B are points on the rays and C is the vertex. For example, if a point D lies on one ray and E on another, and C is the common vertex, then the angle can be labeled CDE or DEC.
x??

#### Triangle Types
Triangles consist of three sides intersecting at vertices, with their angles summing to 180°. Triangles can be classified based on both their angles and side lengths.

- **Isosceles Triangle**: Has two equal sides, and the opposite angles are also equal.
- **Equilateral Triangle**: All sides are equal, and each angle measures 60°.
- **Right Triangle**: Contains one right angle (90°), with the remaining two angles being complementary. The side opposite the right angle is called the hypotenuse, which is the longest side.

The area of a triangle can be calculated using \( A = \frac{1}{2}bh \).
:p What formula is used to find the area of an equilateral triangle?
??x
For an equilateral triangle with all sides equal and each angle measuring 60°, you can use the specific formula for its area: 
\[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 \]
where \( s \) is the length of a side.
x??

---

#### Pythagorean Theorem
The Pythagorean theorem applies to right-angled triangles and states that in such a triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the longest side) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. This relationship can be expressed as:
\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \]

Given \( a = 3 \) and \( b = 4 \), you need to find \( c \).
:p What is the length of the hypotenuse when given triangle sides 3 and 4?
??x
Using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[ c^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 \]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get \( c = 5 \).
x??

#### Types of Quadrilaterals
Quadrilaterals are shapes with four sides and their angles sum up to 360°. Different types include:

- **Squares**: Four equal sides and all angles are right angles.
- **Rectangles**: All angles are right angles, opposite sides are equal.
- **Parallelograms**: Opposite sides are parallel and of equal length, with no requirement for the angles to be right angles.
- **Rhombuses**: Four equal sides but angles do not need to be right angles.
- **Trapezoids**: Exactly two sides are parallel.

The area formulas vary depending on the type. For example:
\[ \text{Area} = l \times w \] for squares and rectangles, where \( l \) is length and \( w \) is width.

For parallelograms: 
\[ \text{Area} = b \times h \]
where \( b \) is base and \( h \) is height.
:p What formula calculates the area of a rhombus?
??x
The area of a rhombus can be calculated using:
\[ A = \frac{1}{2}pq \]
where \( p \) and \( q \) are the lengths of the diagonals. This formula divides by 2 because the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, forming four smaller triangles.
x??

---

#### Area Formulas for Quadrilaterals
For a square or rectangle:
\[ A = l \times w \]

For a parallelogram:
\[ A = b \times h \]
where \( b \) is the base and \( h \) is the height.

For a rhombus:
\[ A = \frac{1}{2} pq \]
where \( p \) and \( q \) are the lengths of the diagonals.

For a trapezoid, the area is given by:
\[ A = \frac{1}{2}(a + b)h \]
where \( a \) and \( b \) are the lengths of the parallel sides, and \( h \) is the height.
:p What formula finds the area of a parallelogram?
??x
The area of a parallelogram can be found using the formula:
\[ A = b \times h \]
where \( b \) represents the base (length of one side), and \( h \) represents the height, which is the perpendicular distance from the base to the opposite side.
