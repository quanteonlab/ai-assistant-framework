#### Finding Specific Information
Background context explaining the concept. The ASVAB Paragraph Comprehension questions often ask you to find specific information directly stated within a passage. These questions are straightforward and test your ability to locate and identify explicit details.

:p What is the correct answer to the example question about martial arts schools?
??x
The correct answer is Choice (C): 6 million.
This question asks for the number of people actively participating in martial arts lessons, which is explicitly stated as "nearly 6 million active members" in the passage. The other numbers provided refer to different aspects: 13,000 schools and 7,000 tae kwon do schools.

#### Recognizing the Main Idea
Background context explaining the concept. This type of question requires you to identify the main point or central idea in a paragraph. It tests your ability to understand the overall message rather than focusing on specific details.

:p What is the main idea of the passage about dogs and cats?
??x
The main idea of the passage is that there are preferences among people regarding pets, with some preferring dogs while others prefer cats.
This involves recognizing the key points: 45% of dogs sleep in their owners' beds, 70% of people sign their dog's name on cards, and "cat people" exist. These details suggest a broader preference for pets.

#### Determining Word Meaning in Context
Background context explaining the concept. These questions test your ability to understand the meaning of words based on how they are used within the text. You need to infer the correct meaning from the surrounding information rather than relying solely on dictionary definitions.

:p What does "meager" mean in the context of the passage about astronauts?
??x
In this context, "meager" means small or insufficient.
The sentence states that the training for astronauts is very rigorous and implies that the pay (\$150,000 per year) is not adequate compensation for such a demanding job. Therefore, "meager" refers to the inadequate financial reward compared to the effort required.

#### Drawing an Implication from a Stated Idea
Background context explaining the concept. This type of question asks you to infer or deduce information that is not explicitly stated in the passage but can be logically concluded based on the given information and your understanding of the text.

:p Why do few people try to become astronauts according to the passage?
??x
According to the passage, few people try to become astronauts because the job is tough, the training is rigorous, and the pay (\$150,000 per year) is not worth the effort required.
The passage provides multiple reasons for why becoming an astronaut is a challenging path: intense training, high expectations, and low compensation. This suggests that most people would avoid such a career due to its demanding nature.
