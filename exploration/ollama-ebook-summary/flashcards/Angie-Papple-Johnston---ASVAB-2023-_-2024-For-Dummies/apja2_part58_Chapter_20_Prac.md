#### Probability of Rolling Dice

Background context: The question involves calculating probabilities related to rolling two six-sided dice. The total number of outcomes when rolling two dice is 6 * 6 = 36. To find the probability of not rolling a five on either die, we first need to calculate the probability of rolling a five and then subtract this from 1.

:p What is the probability of not rolling a five on either die?
??x
The probability of rolling a five on one die is \( \frac{1}{6} \). Therefore, the probability of **not** rolling a five on one die is \( \frac{5}{6} \).

Since the two dice rolls are independent events, the probability of not rolling a five on either die is:
\[ \left( \frac{5}{6} \right) \times \left( \frac{5}{6} \right) = \frac{25}{36} \]

Thus, the correct answer is \( 1 - \frac{25}{36} = \frac{11}{36} \).

However, this question asks for the probability of not rolling a five on **either** die. The direct calculation gives:
\[ \left( \frac{5}{6} \right) \times \left( \frac{5}{6} \right) = \frac{25}{36} \]

So, the correct choice is \( \frac{25}{36} \).

#### Interest Calculation for Loan

Background context: The question involves calculating simple interest. Simple interest can be calculated using the formula:
\[ I = P \times r \times t \]
where \( I \) is the interest, \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial sum of money), \( r \) is the annual interest rate (in decimal form), and \( t \) is the time in years.

:p How much will Bob owe Jack after one year?
??x
Given:
- Principal (\( P \)) = $1,500
- Annual interest rate (\( r \)) = 7% or 0.07
- Time (\( t \)) = 1 year

Using the simple interest formula:
\[ I = 1500 \times 0.07 \times 1 = 105 \]

The total amount Bob will owe Jack after one year is the principal plus the interest:
\[ A = P + I = 1500 + 105 = 1605 \]

#### Tax Calculation for Truck

Background context: The question involves calculating a tax on a truck based on its weight. Given that the truck weighs 2 tons and is taxed at $0.12 per pound, we need to convert the weight of the truck from tons to pounds (1 ton = 2000 pounds) and then apply the tax rate.

:p What is the total tax bill for the 2-ton truck?
??x
First, convert the weight of the truck into pounds:
\[ \text{Weight in pounds} = 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \]

The tax per pound is $0.12, so the total tax is:
\[ \text{Total tax} = 4000 \times 0.12 = 480 \]

#### Equation Solving for y

Background context: The question involves solving an equation with variables \( a \) and \( b \). Given the values of \( ab^{10} \) and \( ab^{2230} \), we need to find the value of \( y \).

:p Solve for \( y \) in the equation \( y = ab^2 \).
??x
Given:
- \( a b^{10} = 45 \)
- \( a b^{2230} = 2230 \)

We need to find the value of \( y = ab^2 \).

From \( a b^{10} = 45 \), we can express \( a \) as:
\[ a = \frac{45}{b^{10}} \]

Substitute this into the second equation:
\[ \left( \frac{45}{b^{10}} \right) b^{2230} = 2230 \]
\[ 45 b^{2220} = 2230 \]
\[ b^{2220} = \frac{2230}{45} \approx 49.56 \]

Now, find \( y = ab^2 \):
\[ y = a b^2 = \left( \frac{45}{b^{10}} \right) b^2 = \frac{45 b^2}{b^{10}} = \frac{45}{b^8} \]

Since \( b^{2220} \approx 49.56 \), we can take the eighth root of both sides:
\[ b \approx (49.56)^{\frac{1}{2220}} \]
\[ y = \frac{45}{(b^8)} \]

Given \( b^{2220} \approx 49.56 \), we find that the value of \( y \) is approximately:
\[ y = 45 / (49.56)^{\frac{1}{277.5}} \approx 50 \]

Thus, the correct choice is \( y = 50 \).

:p What is the percent increase from $2.50 to $2.80?
??x
Given:
- Original value = $2.50
- New value = $2.80

Using the formula for percent increase:
\[ \text{Percent Increase} = \left( \frac{2.80 - 2.50}{2.50} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{0.30}{2.50} \right) \times 100 = 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

#### Paving Stone Calculation

Background context: The question involves calculating the number of paving stones needed to pave a patio. Given the dimensions of the patio and the size of each paving stone, we can determine the total number required.

:p How many 8-inch-square paving stones are needed to pave the patio?
??x
Given:
- Dimensions of the patio = 12 feet by 14 feet
- Size of each paving stone = 8 inches by 8 inches

First, convert the dimensions of the patio into inches (since the size of the stone is in inches):
\[ \text{Length} = 12 \times 12 = 144 \text{ inches} \]
\[ \text{Width} = 14 \times 12 = 168 \text{ inches} \]

Now, calculate how many paving stones fit in the length and width:
\[ \text{Number of stones along the length} = \frac{144}{8} = 18 \]
\[ \text{Number of stones along the width} = \frac{168}{8} = 21 \]

The total number of paving stones needed is:
\[ \text{Total stones} = 18 \times 21 = 378 \]
