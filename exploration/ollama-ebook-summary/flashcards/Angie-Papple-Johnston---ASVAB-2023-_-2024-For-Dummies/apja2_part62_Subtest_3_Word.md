#### Dividing Mixed Numbers by Fractions
When dealing with division of mixed numbers and fractions, it's important to first convert the mixed number into an improper fraction. Then, multiply by the reciprocal of the divisor.

:p How do you divide 10½ by ¾?
??x
To divide 10½ by ¾, first convert the mixed number to an improper fraction:
- $10 \frac{1}{2} = \frac{(10 \times 2 + 1)}{2} = \frac{21}{2}$ Now, multiply by the reciprocal of ¾:
- Reciprocal of ¾ is $\frac{4}{3}$.
So, $\frac{21}{2} \div \frac{3}{4} = \frac{21}{2} \times \frac{4}{3} = \frac{21 \times 4}{2 \times 3} = \frac{84}{6} = 14$.
The answer is 14.

#### Area Calculation for Rectangular Patio
To calculate the number of paving stones needed, first convert all measurements to a common unit (inches) and then divide by the size of each stone.

:p How many paving stones are needed for a patio that measures 12 feet by 14 feet if each stone is 8 inches square?
??x
Convert 12 feet to inches: $12 \times 12 = 144$ inches.
Each stone is 8 inches square, so:
- For the 12-foot side:$\frac{144}{8} = 18$ stones.
For the 14-foot side (converted similarly):
- $14 \times 12 = 168$ inches.
Dividing by stone size:$\frac{168}{8} = 21$ stones.
Total stones needed:$18 \times 21 = 378$.
The answer is 378.

#### Calculating Net Pay
Net pay can be calculated by subtracting the deduction from the gross pay. The formula is:
- Net Pay = Gross Pay - (Gross Pay * Deduction Percentage)

:p How much will a programmer earn after deducting 28% of his salary?
??x
Given a salary of $25,000 and a deduction of 28%, calculate the net pay as follows:
- First, find the deduction amount: $25,000 \times 0.28 = 7,000$.
Then subtract this from the gross pay:
- Net Pay = $25,000 -$7,000 =$18,000.
The answer is $18,000.

:p Determine the cube root of 64 and convert the number 314,000 to scientific notation.
??x
The cube root of 64 is 4 because:
$$4^3 = 64$$

To convert 314,000 to scientific notation, move the decimal point so that there is only one non-zero digit in front of it. In this case, moving the decimal five places left gives $3.14 $, and since we moved it five places, we multiply by $10^5$. Thus, 314,000 in scientific notation is:
$$3.14 \times 10^5$$

The answer is 4 for the cube root and $3.14 \times 10^5$ for scientific notation.

:p Solve the equation $\frac{0.05}{x} = 1 $ for$x$.
??x
To solve $\frac{0.05}{x} = 1 $, multiply both sides of the equation by $ x$:
$$0.05 = x$$

Thus,$x = 0.05$.

The answer is 0.05.
x??

---

#### Quadratic Equations
Background context: A quadratic equation is in the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0 $. Solving these involves factoring or using the quadratic formula. For this example, we can factor out a common term and solve for $ x$.
:p Solve the equation $x^2 - x - 6 = 0 $ for$x$.
??x
To solve $x^2 - x - 6 = 0 $, first look for factors of $-6 $ that add up to$-1 $. The numbers are $-3 $ and$2$:
$$(x - 3)(x + 2) = 0$$

Set each factor equal to zero:
$$x - 3 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 2 = 0$$

Solve for $x$:
$$x = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2$$

The answers are $x = 3 $ or$x = -2$.

The radius of the circle is half the diameter, so:
$$r = \frac{5}{2} = 2.5$$

Using the formula for the area of a circle:
$$

A = \pi r^2 = 3.14 \times (2.5)^2 = 3.14 \times 6.25 = 19.625$$

The area is approximately $19.625$ square inches.

#### Circuit Breaker Operation
Background context: Circuit breakers are essential for protecting electrical circuits from overcurrent conditions. They have three positions—on, off, and trip—and need to be reset by moving the handle to the off position before turning it back on.

:p How does a circuit breaker handle function when tripped?
??x
Conventional circuit breaker handles have three positions: on, off, and trip. When tripped, the handle moves between the on and off positions. To reset the breaker, move the handle to the off position and then to the on position.

#### Power Calculation: Current and Voltage
Background context: Power (P) in an electrical system can be calculated using the formula P = I * V, where I is current and V is voltage.

:p How do you calculate power when given the current and voltage?
??x
To calculate power, use the formula $P = I \times V $. In this case, if $ I = 1200 $ amperes and $ V = 120 $ volts, then the power is $1200 \times 120 = 144,000$ watts or 144 kilowatts.
