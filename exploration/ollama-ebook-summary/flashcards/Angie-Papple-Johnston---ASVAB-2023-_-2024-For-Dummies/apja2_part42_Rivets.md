#### Fastening Methods
Different methods are suitable depending on the situation:
- **Wood screws**: Secure but require more time to install.
- **Nails**: Quick but less secure than screws.
- **Wood glue**: Strong bond when dried but takes time to set.
- **Pop rivets**: Ideal for one-sided access.

:p Which fastening method would be most secure?
??x
Wood screws would form the most secure bond because of their threads, which “grab” wood more securely than nails. However, using wood glue can further strengthen this bond by providing an adhesive connection.
x??

---

#### Time-Efficient Fastening
When time is critical:
- **Screws**: Faster installation due to ease of use with a drill or screwdriver.
- **Mortise and tenon joints**: More precise but slower.
- **Wood glue**: Strong but requires drying time.
