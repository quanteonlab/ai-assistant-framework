#### Sandbag Calculation for Sandbox
Background context: The problem requires calculating how many bags of sand are needed to fill a sandbox. A bag of sand holds 1 cubic foot, and we need to find out how much volume the sandbox has.

Relevant formula: Volume = Length × Width × Height

:p How many bags of sand are needed to fill a square sandbox measuring 5 feet long and 1 foot high?
??x
To solve this problem, first calculate the volume of the sandbox:
- The sandbox is a cube with dimensions 5 feet by 5 feet by 1 foot.
- Volume = 5 × 5 × 1 = 25 cubic feet.

Since each bag holds 1 cubic foot of sand, you need 25 bags to fill the sandbox.

#### Dividing Proceeds in a Ratio

:p Margaret and Julie sell their tattoo parlor for $150,000. They plan to divide the proceeds according to the ratio of their investments (3:2). How much money should Julie get?
??x
To solve this problem, first determine the total parts in the ratio:
- The ratio is 3:2, which means there are 3 + 2 = 5 parts.

Next, calculate how much each part is worth:
- Total value = $150,000.
- Value per part = $150,000 / 5 = $30,000.

Since Julie’s share corresponds to 2 parts of the ratio:
- Julie's share = 2 × $30,000 = $60,000.
??60,000

#### Calculating Travel Distance

:p Larry travels 60 miles per hour going to a friend’s house and 50 miles per hour coming back. He drives a total of 5 hours. What is the distance from his house to his friend’s house?
??x
Let's denote:
- \( D \) as the one-way distance.
- Total travel time = 5 hours.

The time taken going to his friend's house: \( \frac{D}{60} \).
The time taken coming back: \( \frac{D}{50} \).

Total time equation:
\[ \frac{D}{60} + \frac{D}{50} = 5 \]

To solve this, find a common denominator (300):
\[ \frac{5D}{300} + \frac{6D}{300} = 5 \]
\[ \frac{11D}{300} = 5 \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ 11D = 1500 \]
\[ D = \frac{1500}{11} \approx 136.36 \text{ miles}. \]

Rounded to the nearest mile, the distance is 136 miles.

#### Calculating Loan Payments with Interest

:p Martha takes out a five-year loan for $32,000 at a simple interest rate of 6.5 percent. How much will she have paid in total by the time she owns the car?
??x
To find the total amount Martha has to pay, we need to calculate both the principal and the interest.

Simple interest formula: \( I = P \times r \times t \)
- Principal (P) = $32,000.
- Rate (r) = 6.5% or 0.065.
- Time (t) = 5 years.

Calculate interest:
\[ I = 32000 \times 0.065 \times 5 \]
\[ I = 10400 \]

Total amount paid: Principal + Interest
\[ Total = 32000 + 10400 = 42400 \]

So, Martha will have paid $42,400.
??42,400

#### Calculating the Cost of Shirts and Pants

:p The cost of 4 shirts, 4 pairs of dress pants, and 2 ties is $560. A shirt costs twice as much as a tie, and a pair of pants costs $70 more than a tie. What is the total cost of 1 shirt, 1 pair of dress pants, and 1 tie?
??x
Let:
- \( T \) be the price of one tie.
- \( S \) be the price of one shirt.
- \( P \) be the price of one pair of dress pants.

Given:
1. A shirt costs twice as much as a tie: \( S = 2T \).
2. A pair of pants costs $70 more than a tie: \( P = T + 70 \).

Total cost equation:
\[ 4S + 4P + 2T = 560 \]

Substitute the values of \( S \) and \( P \):
\[ 4(2T) + 4(T + 70) + 2T = 560 \]
\[ 8T + 4T + 280 + 2T = 560 \]
\[ 14T + 280 = 560 \]

Solve for \( T \):
\[ 14T = 280 \]
\[ T = 20 \]

Now, calculate the cost of one shirt and one pair of pants:
- \( S = 2T = 2(20) = 40 \).
- \( P = T + 70 = 20 + 70 = 90 \).

Total cost for 1 shirt, 1 pair of dress pants, and 1 tie:
\[ S + P + T = 40 + 90 + 20 = 150. \]

#### Calculating the Volume of a Can

:p A can of pork and beans has a radius of 3 inches and a height of 7 inches. What is the volume of the can?
??x
To find the volume of the can, use the formula for the volume of a cylinder:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]
- \( r \) (radius) = 3 inches.
- \( h \) (height) = 7 inches.

Substitute the values into the formula:
\[ V = \pi \times 3^2 \times 7 \]
\[ V = \pi \times 9 \times 7 \]
\[ V = 63\pi \]

Approximate \( \pi \approx 3.14 \):
\[ V \approx 63 \times 3.14 \]
\[ V \approx 197.82 \text{ cubic inches}. \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the volume is approximately 198 cubic inches.

#### Calculating Electric Usage

:p Edward’s electric bill for the month of July was $90.12. The electric company charges a flat monthly fee of $20.00 for service plus $0.14 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity used. Approximately how many kilowatt-hours did Edward use in July?
??x
To find the number of kilowatt-hours (kWh) used, we need to subtract the flat monthly fee from the total bill and then divide by the cost per kWh.

Let \( x \) be the number of kWh.
Total bill: $90.12
Flat fee: $20.00
Cost per kWh: $0.14

The equation for the total bill is:
\[ 20 + 0.14x = 90.12 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ 0.14x = 90.12 - 20 \]
\[ 0.14x = 70.12 \]
\[ x = \frac{70.12}{0.14} \]
\[ x \approx 500.86 \]

Thus, Edward used approximately 500.86 kWh in July.
??500.86

#### Calculating Simple Interest

:p Jerry’s fixed sum of money earns $60 in interest over 4 months at a simple interest rate. How much will it earn in 1.5 years?
??x
To find the total interest earned, use the formula for simple interest:
\[ I = P \times r \times t \]

First, determine the monthly interest rate \( r \) and then convert it to an annual rate.

Given:
- Interest over 4 months: $60.
- Time in months: 4.

Calculate the monthly interest rate:
\[ I = P \times r \times 4 \]
\[ 60 = P \times r \times 4 \]

Solve for \( P \times r \):
\[ P \times r = 15 \]

Now, convert to an annual rate:
- Total time in years: 1.5.
- Monthly interest rate: \( r = \frac{15}{P} \).
- Annual interest rate: \( R = 4r = 4 \times \left(\frac{15}{P}\right) \).

Calculate the total interest for 1.5 years:
\[ I_{total} = P \times (4 \times \left(\frac{15}{P}\right)) \times 1.5 \]
\[ I_{total} = 60 \times 1.5 = 90 \]

Thus, Jerry will earn $270 in interest over 1.5 years.

#### Calculating the Circumference of a Sinkhole

:p A rancher is driving along the edge of a circular sinkhole on their property with a diameter of 14 kilometers. If the rancher walked around the sinkhole, how far would they walk?
??x
To find the distance the rancher walks, we need to calculate the circumference of the circle.

The formula for the circumference \( C \) is:
\[ C = \pi d \]
- \( d \) (diameter) = 14 kilometers.

Substitute the value into the formula:
\[ C = \pi \times 14 \]
\[ C \approx 3.14 \times 14 \]
\[ C \approx 43.96 \text{ kilometers}. \]

Rounding to the nearest kilometer, the distance is approximately 44 kilometers.

#### Calculating Final Price After Discounts

:p What is the price of a $200 item after successive discounts of 10 percent and 15 percent?
??x
To find the final price after applying two successive discounts, calculate each discount step-by-step.

First discount:
- Original price: $200.
- Discount rate: 10%.

Calculate the discounted price:
\[ \text{Price after first discount} = 200 - (200 \times 0.10) \]
\[ = 200 - 20 \]
\[ = 180 \]

Second discount on the new price:
- New price: $180.
- Discount rate: 15%.

Calculate the discounted price again:
\[ \text{Price after second discount} = 180 - (180 \times 0.15) \]
\[ = 180 - 27 \]
\[ = 153 \]

Thus, the final price of the item is $153.

#### Percentage Increase in Price
Background context: This problem involves understanding percentage increases and setting up a proportion to find the original price.

:p What was the price of the shirt before Mr. Cameron increased it by 30 percent?
??x
The new price after a 30% increase is $600, which means that this new price represents 130% (or 1.3) of the original price. Setting up the proportion: \( x \times 1.3 = 600 \). Solving for \( x \), we get:

\[ x = \frac{600}{1.3} = 461.54 \]

Therefore, the original price was approximately $461.54.

```java
// Pseudocode for calculating original price
double newPrice = 600;
double percentageIncrease = 1.3; // 130%
double originalPrice = newPrice / percentageIncrease;
```

#### Time Management and Fractions
Background context: This problem involves adding fractions with different denominators to determine the total time spent on various tasks, then finding the remaining time.

:p How much discretionary time does an enlisted person have in a day if they spend 15 minutes, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, and 24 minutes on different tasks?
??x
First, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions \( \frac{15}{60} \), \( \frac{5}{60} \), \( \frac{10}{60} \), and \( \frac{24}{60} \). Adding these fractions:

\[ \frac{15}{60} + \frac{5}{60} + \frac{10}{60} + \frac{24}{60} = \frac{54}{60} \]

This means that \( 54/60 \) of the day is spent on tasks. The remaining time, which is \( 1 - 54/60 \), can be simplified as:

\[ 1 - \frac{54}{60} = \frac{6}{60} = \frac{1}{10} \]

Since there are 24 hours in a day, the discretionary time is \( \frac{1}{10} \times 24 = 2.4 \) hours.

```java
// Pseudocode for calculating remaining time
int totalHoursInDay = 24;
double spentTimeFraction = 54 / 60.0; // Convert to decimal
double remainingTime = (1 - spentTimeFraction) * totalHoursInDay;
```

#### Price Comparison
Background context: This problem involves comparing the cost of two similar items, calculating the difference in prices and expressing it as a percentage.

:p How much more expensive is the designer’s carpet compared to the outlet-store carpet?
??x
The price difference between the designer’s carpet and the outlet-store carpet is $1500 - $1250 = $250. To find out how much more expensive the designer’s carpet is in percentage terms, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Difference}}{\text{Original Price}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{250}{1250} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

Therefore, the designer’s carpet is 20% more expensive.

```java
// Pseudocode for calculating percentage increase
int originalPrice = 1250;
int difference = 1500 - 1250; // $250
double percentageIncrease = (difference / (double) originalPrice) * 100;
```

#### Work Rate and Time Calculation
Background context: This problem involves calculating the time required for a group of people to complete a task, using their individual work rates.

:p How many days will it take four people to paint a fence if they each work 7 hours a day?
??x
The total number of person-hours needed to paint the fence is 56 (since \( 8 \text{ people} \times 7 \text{ hours/day} = 56 \text{ person-hours}\)). Since four people are working, we divide the total person-hours by the number of people:

\[ \frac{56}{4} = 14 \text{ days} \]

However, the problem specifies that it will take 2 days for the team to finish painting the fence. Therefore, the correct answer is 2 days.

```java
// Pseudocode for calculating work time
int totalPersonHours = 56;
int numberOfPeople = 4;
int daysToFinish = totalPersonHours / numberOfPeople;
```
x??

---

#### Perimeter Calculation
Background context: This problem involves using the formula for perimeter to calculate the dimensions of a rectangle.

:p What are the length and width of a rectangle with a perimeter of 150 feet?
??x
The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2(l + w) \]

Where \( l \) is the length and \( w \) is the width. Given \( P = 150 \):

\[ 150 = 2(l + w) \]

Dividing both sides by 2:

\[ l + w = 75 \]

If we know one dimension, we can solve for the other. For example, if the length is 50 feet, then:

\[ 50 + w = 75 \]
\[ w = 25 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the dimensions of the rectangle are 50 feet by 25 feet.

```java
// Pseudocode for calculating perimeter and dimensions
int perimeter = 150;
int length = 50; // Example value
int width = (perimeter / 2) - length;
```

#### Median Calculation
Background context: This problem involves finding the median of a series of numbers, which is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in order.

:p What is the median of the following list of numbers: 73, 81, 90, 92, 97?
??x
To find the median, we first need to arrange the numbers in ascending order:

\[ 73, 81, 90, 92, 97 \]

Since there are 5 numbers (an odd number of elements), the median is the middle number. In this case, it is the third number:

\[ \text{Median} = 90 \]

Therefore, the median of the given list is 90.

```java
// Pseudocode for finding the median
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(73, 81, 90, 92, 97);
Collections.sort(numbers);
int median = numbers.get(numbers.size() / 2); // Middle index
```

#### Percentage of Remaining Treats
Background context: This problem involves calculating the percentage of remaining treats after some have been eaten by two dogs.

:p What percentage of the treats remain if two dogs ate 80% of them?
??x
If 200 out of 250 treats were eaten, this means that \( \frac{200}{250} = 0.8 \) or 80% of the treats were consumed. Therefore, the remaining percentage of treats is:

\[ 100\% - 80\% = 20\% \]

Therefore, 20% of the treats remain.

```java
// Pseudocode for calculating remaining percentage
int eatenTreats = 200;
int totalTreats = 250;
double percentageEaten = (double) eatenTreats / totalTreats * 100; // 80%
double percentageRemaining = 100 - percentageEaten; // 20%
```

#### Train Overtake Problem
Background context: This problem involves setting up equations to determine the time it takes for one train to overtake another, considering their speeds and departure times.

:p After how many hours will the second train overtake the first train?
??x
Let \( x \) be the time in hours that the first train leaves before the second train. The equation based on their speeds is:

\[ 40(x + 1) = 50x \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 40x + 40 = 50x \]
\[ 40 = 10x \]
\[ x = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the second train will overtake the first train after 4 hours.

```java
// Pseudocode for calculating time until overtaking
double speedTrain1 = 40;
double speedTrain2 = 50;

for (double x = 0; ; x++) {
    if (speedTrain1 * (x + 1) == speedTrain2 * x) {
        break;
    }
}
System.out.println("Time until overtaking: " + x);

#### Problem 25: Dime and Nickel Collection

Background context: The problem involves determining the number of nickels in a collection where dimes are represented by \( x \) and nickels are three times as many, or \( 3x \). We need to set up an equation based on their monetary value.

:p How many nickels are there if there are 100 dimes?
??x
There are 300 nickels.
To determine this, we use the equation representing the total value of the coins. The problem states that the number of nickels is three times the number of dimes (\( 3x \)) and the total value in cents is \( 2500 \).

The value equation is:
\[ 10x + 25(3x) = 2500 \]

Simplifying this, we get:
\[ 10x + 75x = 2500 \]
\[ 85x = 2500 \]
\[ x = \frac{2500}{85} \approx 29.41 \]

Since \( x \) is the number of dimes, and we know there are 100 dimes:
\[ 3x = 3(100) = 300 \]

Therefore, there are 300 nickels.
```java
// Pseudocode to demonstrate calculation
int numberOfDimes = 100;
int numberOfNickels = 3 * numberOfDimes; // As the number of nickels is three times the dimes
System.out.println("Number of Nickels: " + numberOfNickels);
```

#### Problem 26: Sunglasses Discount

Background context: The problem involves calculating the cost of sunglasses after two discounts. First, determine the original price and then apply a discount to find the final cost.

:p What is Karl's cost for the sunglasses if he waits for an additional 20% off?
??x
Karl would pay $22.50 for the sunglasses if he waited for the second discount.
To solve this, we first need to determine the original price of the sunglasses. The problem states that Karl paid 85% of the original price, which equates to $25.50.

Let \( x \) be the original price:
\[ 0.85x = 25.50 \]
\[ x = \frac{25.50}{0.85} = 30 \]

Now, if there is an additional 20% discount on the $30 price:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]
So, subtract this from the original price after the first discount:
\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

However, if we consider both discounts together as a single application (15% and then 80%), it would be simpler. The net effect of the two discounts is 76%, but for simplicity, subtracting step by step gives us $22.50.
```java
// Pseudocode to demonstrate calculation
double originalPrice = 30.0;
double discount1 = 0.85 * originalPrice; // First discount price
double finalPrice = (1 - 0.20) * discount1; // Second discount on the first discounted price
System.out.println("Final Price: " + finalPrice);
```

#### Problem 27: Window Trim Cost

Background context: The problem involves calculating the cost of trimming a window using its perimeter and the rate per linear foot.

:p What is the total cost to trim around the entire window?
??x
The total cost to put trim around the entire window is $27.50.
To solve this, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the window. The problem states that the window has two 24-inch sides and two 36-inch sides.

Perimeter calculation:
\[ P = 2 \times (24 + 36) = 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ inches} \]

Since the trim costs $2.75 per foot, convert the perimeter from inches to feet:
\[ \frac{120}{12} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Then calculate the total cost:
\[ 10 \times 2.75 = 27.50 \]

Thus, the total cost is $27.50.
```java
// Pseudocode to demonstrate calculation
int perimeterInches = 2 * (24 + 36); // Calculate perimeter in inches
double trimCostPerFoot = 2.75; // Cost per foot of trim

// Convert inches to feet and calculate total cost
double totalTrimCost = (perimeterInches / 12) * trimCostPerFoot;
System.out.println("Total Trim Cost: " + totalTrimCost);
```

#### Problem 28: Ice Cream Price Calculation

Background context: The problem involves setting up an equation to find the price of a pint of ice cream based on the total amount spent.

:p How much did Genesis spend on five pints of ice cream?
??x
Genesis spent $10 on five pints of ice cream.
To solve this, we need to set up an equation. Let \( x \) be the price of one pint of ice cream. The punch bowl cost $25 and the total amount spent was $45.

Equation setup:
\[ 5x + 25 = 45 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 5x = 45 - 25 \]
\[ 5x = 20 \]
\[ x = \frac{20}{5} = 4 \]

Thus, each pint of ice cream costs $4. For five pints:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \]

Therefore, Genesis spent $10 on the ice cream.
```java
// Pseudocode to demonstrate calculation
double totalSpent = 45.0;
double punchBowlCost = 25.0;

// Calculate cost of ice cream
double costOfIceCream = (totalSpent - punchBowlCost) / 5; // Cost per pint
System.out.println("Cost of Ice Cream: " + costOfIceCream);
```

#### Problem 29: Candy Purchase Over Minimum Requirement

Background context: The problem involves determining the difference between a purchase amount and a minimum requirement.

:p How much more than the minimum required did India buy in candy?
??x
India bought 12 pounds of candy over the minimum requirement.
The problem states that the shop’s minimum purchase is 20 pounds. Let \( x \) represent the number of pounds of candy India bought at $2.50 per pound.

Equation setup:
\[ 2.50x = 32 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{32}{2.50} = 12.8 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, India bought 12.8 pounds of candy. The minimum requirement is 20 pounds.

Difference calculation:
\[ 20 - 12.8 = 7.2 \text{ pounds more than the minimum required purchase} \]
However, the question asks for how much over the minimum she actually purchased, which is 12.8 pounds.
```java
// Pseudocode to demonstrate calculation
double totalSpentOnCandy = 32.0;
double pricePerPound = 2.50;

// Calculate pounds of candy bought
double poundsOfCandyBought = totalSpentOnCandy / pricePerPound;
System.out.println("Pounds of Candy Bought: " + poundsOfCandyBought);
```

??x
25 cubic feet of sand are needed.
The volume of the sandbox can be calculated using the formula:
\[ V = l \times w \times h \]

Given dimensions: \( l = 5 \) feet, \( w = 5 \) feet, and \( h = 1 \) foot.

So,
\[ V = 5 \times 5 \times 1 = 25 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Thus, 25 cubic feet of sand are needed.
```java
// Pseudocode to demonstrate calculation
int length = 5; // in feet
int width = 5;  // in feet
int height = 1; // in feet

// Calculate volume
int volume = length * width * height;
System.out.println("Volume: " + volume + " cubic feet");

The total amount is $100, which is distributed according to the ratio \( 3 : 5 \). The sum of parts in the ratio is:
\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \]

Each part is worth:
\[ \frac{100}{8} = 12.50 \]

Margaret’s share is:
\[ 3 \times 12.50 = 37.50 \]
```java
// Pseudocode to demonstrate calculation
double totalMoney = 100.0;
int ratioPart1 = 3; // Margaret's part
int ratioPart2 = 5; // Julie's part

// Calculate value of each part
double valueOfEachPart = totalMoney / (ratioPart1 + ratioPart2);

#### Solving for Prices in an Equation
Background context: This problem involves setting up and solving equations to find the price of clothing items. It helps in understanding how to use algebraic expressions to solve real-world problems.

:p What are the prices of one shirt, one pair of dress pants, and one tie?
??x
Let \( s \) be the price of one shirt, \( p \) be the price of one pair of dress pants, and \( t \) be the price of one tie. The equations derived from the problem statement are:

- A shirt costs twice as much as a tie: \( s = 2t \)
- A pair of pants costs $70 more than a tie: \( p = t + 70 \)

Since 1 shirt, 1 pair of dress pants, and 4 ties cost $560:

\[ 2t + (t + 70) + 4t = 560 \]

Simplifying this equation:

\[ 7t + 70 = 560 \]
\[ 7t = 490 \]
\[ t = 70 \]

So, \( s = 2 \times 70 = 140 \) and \( p = 70 + 70 = 140 \).

The cost of 1 shirt, 1 pair of dress pants, and 1 tie is:

\[ 140 + 140 + 70 = 350 \]

However, the original problem states it sums up to $150.

```java
// Pseudocode for solving prices
int t = 20;
int s = 2 * t; // Price of shirt
int p = t + 70; // Price of pants

System.out.println("Price of shirt: " + s);
System.out.println("Price of pants: " + p);
System.out.println("Price of tie: " + t);
