#### Proportions and Ratios
Proportion is a mathematical comparison between two ratios. For example, 3 parts vinegar to 1 part water (3:1) is a ratio, while comparing this with another similar one like 9 parts vinegar to 3 parts water would be a proportion.
If two sets of numbers increase or decrease in the same ratio, they are directly proportional to each other. This can be identified using symbols like :: or ∝.

:p What does the symbol ∝ represent in mathematical comparisons?
??x
The symbol ∝ represents direct proportion between two quantities. If one quantity is a constant multiple of the other, they are directly proportional.

#### Direct Proportions in ASVAB Problems
Direct proportions occur when an increase in one value leads to a corresponding increase in another at a fixed ratio. For example, if 1 inch on a map equals 250 miles, then 5 inches would correspondingly equal 1250 miles.

:p How can you solve for the unknown quantity in direct proportion problems?
??x
To solve for the unknown quantity in direct proportion problems, set up the equation as a proportion and cross-multiply to isolate the variable. For example, if 1 inch is proportional to 250 miles, then to find out how many miles correspond to 5 inches:
``` 
1/250 = 5/x
x = 1250 miles
```
This means that 5 inches on the map would represent 1250 miles.

#### Inverse Proportions in ASVAB Problems
Inverse proportions occur when one value increases and another decreases. For example, more workers on a job reduce the time needed to complete it.

:p How can you solve for the unknown quantity in inverse proportion problems?
??x
In inverse proportions, if one variable increases while the other decreases at a fixed product, the relationship can be expressed as $xy = k $, where $ k$ is a constant. For example, if more workers (W) are hired to complete a job in less time (T), their relationship would follow:
```
W1 * T1 = W2 * T2
```
To find an unknown value, rearrange the equation as needed.

Example: If 4 workers can complete a task in 5 days, how long will it take for 8 workers to complete the same task?
``` 
4 * 5 = 8 * T2
T2 = (4 * 5) / 8 = 2.5 days
```
So, 8 workers would need 2.5 days to complete the task.

#### Rates in ASVAB Problems
Rates are fixed quantities used for comparison or calculation. Common rates include speed and interest rates.

:p What is a rate formula useful for solving problems involving distance and time?
??x
The distance-rate-time formula $d = rt$ can be used to solve for any of the three variables when you know the other two:
- Distance (d) = Rate (r) * Time (t)
- Example: If John drives at a rate of 60 miles per hour and travels for 3 hours, how far does he travel?
``` 
d = rt
d = 60 * 3 = 180 miles
```
So, John travels 180 miles.

#### Simple Interest Calculation
Simple interest is calculated using the formula $I = Prt$, where:
- I is the interest,
- P is the principal (initial amount),
- r is the interest rate as a decimal,
- t is time in years.

:p What does the "P" stand for in simple interest calculations?
??x
In simple interest calculations, "P" stands for the principal, which is the initial amount of money invested or borrowed. For example:
``` 
I = Prt
If P = $1000, r = 5% (or 0.05), t = 2 years,
I = 1000 * 0.05 * 2 = $100
```
So, the interest earned on a principal of $1000 at an annual rate of 5% over 2 years would be$100.

#### Rate as Division
Background context: In a rate, you can generally think of "per" as a division sign. For example, if someone drives 141 miles in 3 hours and needs to find the average speed, you want the rate of speed in miles per hour.

:p What is the formula for calculating the average speed?
??x
To calculate the average speed, you divide the total distance by the total time.
$$\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}$$

For example:
```python
distance = 141  # miles
time = 3        # hours
speed = distance / time  # Result: 47.0 miles/hour
```

#### Scientific Notation
Background context: Scientific notation is a compact format for writing very large or very small numbers, commonly used in scientific fields but also relevant on the Mathematics Knowledge subtest of the ASVAB.

:p What does scientific notation separate a number into?
??x
Scientific notation separates a number into two parts: 
1. A coefficient that is a number between 1 and 10.
2. A power of ten (such as $10^7 $, $10^{-8}$).
For example, the number 125 can be written in scientific notation as:
$$1.25 \times 10^2$$x??

#### Square Roots
Background context: The square root of a number is a factor that when multiplied by itself equals the original number. Perfect squares have exact roots, while irrational numbers do not.

:p How can you find the square root of a perfect square without a calculator?
??x
To find the square root of a perfect square without a calculator, memorize the square roots of the first 12 perfect squares:
$$\begin{align*}
1^2 &= 1 & \sqrt{1} &= 1 \\
2^2 &= 4 & \sqrt{4} &= 2 \\
3^2 &= 9 & \sqrt{9} &= 3 \\
4^2 &= 16 & \sqrt{16} &= 4 \\
5^2 &= 25 & \sqrt{25} &= 5 \\
6^2 &= 36 & \sqrt{36} &= 6 \\
7^2 &= 49 & \sqrt{49} &= 7 \\
8^2 &= 64 & \sqrt{64} &= 8 \\
9^2 &= 81 & \sqrt{81} &= 9 \\
10^2 &= 100 & \sqrt{100} &= 10 \\
11^2 &= 121 & \sqrt{121} &= 11 \\
12^2 &= 144 & \sqrt{144} &= 12 \\
\end{align*}$$

For example, to find the square root of 36, you know it's 6 because $6^2 = 36$.

#### Square Roots of Irrational Numbers
Background context: For non-perfect squares, finding the square root is more challenging. The ASVAB typically asks for the nearest tenth.

:p How can you approximate the square root of a number that isn't a perfect square?
??x
For numbers like 54, which aren't perfect squares:
1. Identify the closest perfect squares.
2. Make an educated guess based on their roots.
3. Refine your guess by testing values between these perfect squares.

Example: Find $\sqrt{54}$:
- The closest perfect squares are $49 $(which is $7^2 $) and $64 $(which is $8^2$).
- Since 54 is closer to 49, the root will be closer to 7.
- Test:
  - $7.3 \times 7.3 = 53.29 $-$7.4 \times 7.4 = 54.76$ Thus, the square root of 54 is approximately 7.3 (since 53.29 is closer to 54 than 54.76).

#### Noticing Patterns in Squaring and Square Roots

When faced with questions involving squaring a number and then taking the square root of its result, recognize that the original number often reappears. This is due to the inverse nature of these operations.

For example:
- $81^2$ results in 6561.
- $\sqrt{6561}$ yields 81 again.

:p Notice the pattern when you square a number and then take the square root of its result. What is the outcome?
??x
The outcome is that the original number reappears, as squaring and taking the square root are inverse operations.
x??

#### Reading Questions Carefully

Always read questions thoroughly to understand what they're asking. Sometimes, questions might appear more complex than they actually are. For instance, a question about solving for an unknown variable can often be simplified by recognizing it involves basic arithmetic.

:p Suppose you see the following: Solve for $s $: $ s^2 = 51 - 2$. How would you approach this problem?
??x
Simplify the right side of the equation first to get $s^2 = 49 $. Then, taking the square root of both sides yields $ s = 7 $or$ s = -7$. However, since we're usually looking for a positive solution in such contexts, the answer is 7.

#### Solving Partially and Guessing the Rest

When faced with complex problems requiring multiple steps, tackle what you can first. For example, if you don't remember how to multiply decimals, simplify the problem by focusing on the multiplication of simpler numbers.

:p Consider this question: What's the value of $0.03 \times 0.03$?
??x
First, recognize that multiplying 0.03 and 0.03 is essentially finding $3 \times 3 = 9$. Then, consider the decimal places: there are six total places after the decimal in both numbers, so place the decimal point in your answer to make it have six places. This gives you 0.000027.

#### Using Process of Elimination

If you’re unsure about how to solve a problem, try plugging the given choices back into the equation. This can help you identify the correct answer even if you don’t know the exact solution method.

:p Solve for $x $: $ x^5 = 32$.
??x
Plugging in each option:
- (A) $5^5 \neq 32 $- (B)$32^5$ is much larger than 32
- (C)$32^5$ is also not equal to 32
- (D)$37^5 $ doesn’t fit, but checking simpler values like$2^5 = 32$.

So the correct answer is Choice (D).

#### Time Management on ASVAB

For the pencil-and-paper version of the ASVAB, if you encounter a problem that seems unsolvable, use elimination or guesswork. For the computer version, since questions cannot be skipped, budget your time wisely to avoid spending too much on any single question.

:p On the pencil-and-paper ASVAB, what is a good strategy for problems that seem impossible?
??x
A good strategy is to use process of elimination by plugging in answer choices. This can help you narrow down the correct answer even if you’re unsure how to solve it step-by-step.
