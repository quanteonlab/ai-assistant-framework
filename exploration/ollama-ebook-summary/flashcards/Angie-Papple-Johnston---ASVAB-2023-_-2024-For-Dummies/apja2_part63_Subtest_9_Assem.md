#### Equilibrium in Levers
In a lever system, if one side loses weight, the other side must gain an equivalent amount to maintain balance.

:p How does moving Basket A affect Basket B?
??x
Moving Basket A to the right counterbalances the loss of cherries from Basket B by gaining an equal weight on the opposite side.
x??

---

#### Comparison of Wheel and Axle Systems
A larger wheel in a wheel and axle system makes more revolutions compared to a smaller one when covering the same distance.

:p Which wheel covers less ground per revolution?
??x
Wheel B covers less ground per revolution because it has fewer teeth or a greater radius compared to Wheel A, meaning it needs to make more revolutions to cover the same distance.
x??

#### Calculating Pressure in Physics

Pressure is calculated as Force divided by Area (P = F/A). In this problem, P200 10 20.

:p How do you calculate pressure?
??x
You can calculate pressure using the formula \( P = \frac{F}{A} \), where \( P \) is pressure, \( F \) is force, and \( A \) is area. For example, if a force of 200 units is applied over an area of 10 square units, the pressure would be 20 units.
x??

---

#### Lever Mechanics

In a lever system, moving one end (Anvil A) toward the center results in the other end (Anvil B) moving downward.

:p What happens when Anvil A moves closer to the pivot point?
??x
When Anvil A is moved closer to the pivot point, Anvil B will move toward the ground because of the principle of leverage. The lever system forces a trade-off between distances and weights.
x??

Micrometers are used to measure very small but not microscopic objects. They provide a high degree of precision, typically down to the micrometer scale (10^-6 meters).
x??

---

#### Effect of Weight on Levers

Reducing the weight on one side of a lever will cause that side to move downward.

:p How does reducing the weight on Side B affect Side A?
??x
Reducing the weight on Side B will cause Side A to move toward the ground because the system is in equilibrium, and any change in weight on one side must be balanced by an equal change on the other side.
x??

---

#### Friction Basics

Objects rubbing together produce friction.

:p What causes friction?
??x
Friction occurs when two surfaces come into contact and rub against each other. The force of resistance to this motion is known as friction, which can slow down or stop moving objects.
x??

---

#### Atmospheric Pressure

Normal atmospheric pressure at sea level is 14.7 psi.

:p What is the normal atmospheric pressure at sea level?
??x
The normal atmospheric pressure at sea level is 14.7 pounds per square inch (psi). This value can vary slightly depending on weather conditions and altitude.
x??

---

#### Gear Meshing

Gears of unequal size can mesh properly as long as their teeth are of equal size.

:p Can gears of different sizes mesh together?
??x
Yes, gears of different sizes can mesh together as long as their teeth interlock correctly. The key is that the pitch (distance between teeth) on both gears must be compatible.
x??

---

#### Torsion Springs

Torsion springs produce a twisting action but not a direct pull.

:p What does a torsion spring do?
??x
A torsion spring coils or uncoils, producing a twisting action known as torque. It does not apply a direct linear force like a simple spring.
x??

---

#### Inclined Plane Efficiency

The inclined plane is the most efficient device for moving heavy objects vertically over short distances.

:p Which mechanical advantage device is most efficient for small height changes?
??x
For moving heavy objects a few feet in height, the inclined plane is the most efficient device. This is because it provides a mechanical advantage by reducing the force needed to lift an object vertically.
x??

---

#### Expansion of Water

Water expands when frozen, which can cause damage.

:p What happens to water when it freezes?
??x
When water freezes, it expands due to its unique molecular structure, which causes it to occupy more space than liquid water. This expansion can potentially damage engine components if not accounted for.
x??

---

#### Load Distribution in Levers

The load is closer to the heavier anvil (Anvil A), so it carries a greater portion of the weight.

:p How does load distribution work in this lever system?
??x
In the lever system, Anvil A, being closer to the pivot point, carries more of the total weight. This means that if you apply the same force, the lever will exert more pressure on Anvil A.
x??

---

#### Stationary Parts in Levers

Only the lower block remains stationary while the upper block moves.

:p Which parts remain stationary in this lever system?
??x
In the described lever system, only the lower block remains stationary. The upper block is free to move due to the application of force or weight on it.
x??

---

#### Lever Mechanics with Gears

Applying the leverage formula helps determine how forces are distributed in a lever.

:p How do you apply the leverage formula?
??x
The leverage formula \( \frac{\text{Length of Effort Arm}}{\text{Length of Resistance Arm}} = \frac{\text{Resistance Force}}{\text{Effort Force}} \) can be used to determine how forces are distributed. For example, if the effort arm is 9 units and the resistance arm is 321 units, then the effort force is \( \frac{9}{321} \times 7 = \frac{63}{321} \approx 0.196 \) of the resistance force.
x??

---

#### Cam-Operated Valves

Valves open each time a high point on the cam hits them.

:p How does the cam mechanism work to control valves?
??x
The cam mechanism works by having high points on the cam surface that interact with the valve. Each time a high point of the cam reaches a valve, it forces the valve to open. Given that the cam has three high points, the valve will open three times per revolution.
x??

---

#### Controlling Water Flow

Closing specific valves keeps water from leaving the tank.

:p Which valves should be closed to prevent water flow?
??x
To keep water from leaving the tank, you should close Valves 3 and 4. This action prevents any water that might otherwise flow out through these valves.
x??

---

#### Gear Rotation Direction

Gears in mesh always turn in opposite directions.

:p How do gears in mesh rotate relative to each other?
??x
Gears in mesh always rotate in opposite directions. If one gear turns clockwise, the gear it is meshed with will turn counterclockwise, and vice versa.
x??

#### Gear Ratio and RPM Calculation
Background context: This concept deals with understanding how gear sizes affect their rotational speeds. When gears mesh, the smaller gear rotates faster than the larger one. The relationship between the number of teeth on each gear determines their speed ratio.

:p If Gear 1 turns at 10 rpm and Gear 2 is half the size of Gear 1, what is Gear 2's RPM?
??x
Gear 2 will turn twice as fast as Gear 1 because it has fewer teeth. Therefore, if Gear 1 rotates at 10 rpm, Gear 2 will rotate at \(2 \times 10 = 20\) rpm.
x??

---

#### Valve System Operation for Fuel Filters
Background context: This question tests the understanding of how valves control fuel flow through various filters in a system. Different combinations of valves can direct or block fuel from reaching certain components.

:p Which set of valve openings allows the fuel to travel through Filter D?
??x
Valves 1, 2, and 3 must be opened to allow the fuel to reach Filter D.
x??

---

#### Fuel-Air Mixture Adjustment
Background context: Understanding the relationship between fuel-air mixture and flame color is essential for proper engine operation. A yellow flame indicates that the mixture is too rich (too much fuel or not enough air).

:p What does a yellow flame indicate, and what should be done to correct it?
??x
A yellow flame indicates a fuel-air mixture that is too rich, meaning there's either too much fuel or not enough air. To correct this, more air should be allowed to enter and mix with the gas.
x??

---

#### Float Level Indicator in Fuel Tanks
Background context: The float system in a fuel tank measures the water level and can indicate if the tank has overflowed. A defective float could lead to incorrect readings.

:p If the tank overflows, what is likely to be the issue?
