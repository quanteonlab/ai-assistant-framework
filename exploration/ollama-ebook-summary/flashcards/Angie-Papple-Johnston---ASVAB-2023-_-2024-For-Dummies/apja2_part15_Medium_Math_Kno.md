#### Adding and Subtracting Fractions

Background context: Understanding how to add and subtract fractions is essential for many mathematical operations. When adding or subtracting fractions, you need a common denominator. The formula for finding a common denominator involves multiplying the denominators if they are different.

:p How do you solve 2/3 + 1/6?
??x
First, find a common denominator for both fractions. In this case, the least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 6 is 6. Convert 2/3 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 6: $\frac{2}{3} = \frac{4}{6}$. Now you can add the fractions directly:
$$\frac{4}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6}$$

Therefore,$\frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6}$.

#### Simplifying Fractions

Background context: A fraction is simplified when the numerator and denominator have no common factors other than 1. The process involves finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator, then dividing both by this number.

:p How do you simplify the fraction $\frac{9}{24}$?
??x
To simplify $\frac{9}{24}$, find the GCD of 9 and 24. The factors of 9 are $1, 3, 9 $ and the factors of 24 are $1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24$. The greatest common divisor is 3. Divide both the numerator and denominator by 3:
$$\frac{9 \div 3}{24 \div 3} = \frac{3}{8}$$

Therefore,$\frac{9}{24}$ simplifies to $\frac{3}{8}$.

#### Finding the Average

Background context: The average (or mean) of a set of numbers is found by summing all the values and dividing by the number of values. For example, if you have $n $ numbers$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$, their average is:
$$\text{Average} = \frac{a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n}{n}$$:p What is the average of 101, 15, 62, 84, and 55?
??x
To find the average:
1. Sum all the numbers:$101 + 15 + 62 + 84 + 55 = 317$.
2. Divide by the number of values (which is 5):
$$\text{Average} = \frac{317}{5} = 63.4$$

Therefore, the average is $63.4$.

#### Proportions

Background context: A proportion states that two ratios are equal. The form of a proportion is $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$, which can also be written as $ ad = bc$.

:p Find the unknown in the proportion 7 : 1028 :: ? : 4.
??x
To solve this, use cross-multiplication:
$$\frac{7}{1028} = \frac{x}{4}$$

Cross-multiply to find $x$:
$$7 \times 4 = 1028 \times x \implies 28 = 1028x$$

Solve for $x$:
$$x = \frac{28}{1028} = \frac{7}{257}$$

Therefore, the unknown is:
$$\boxed{\frac{7}{257}}$$x??

#### Percents

Background context: Percent means "per hundred" and can be converted to fractions or decimals. The formula for finding a percentage of a number is $\frac{\text{part}}{\text{whole}} \times 100$.

:p What is the amount after applying 5 percent discount on a $75.50 dinner order?
??x
To find 5% of $75.50:
$$\text{Discount} = \frac{5}{100} \times 75.50 = 0.05 \times 75.50 = 3.775$$

Subtract the discount from the original price:
$$75.50 - 3.775 = 71.725$$

Therefore, after a 5% discount, the dinner order amounts to $\boxed{71.725}$.

   \end{array}$$2. Subtract column by column from right to left:
   - Units:$7 - 4 = 3$.
   - Tens: $8 - 5 = 3$.
   - Hundreds: $3 - 6 $ requires borrowing, so it becomes$13 - 6 = 7$, borrow 1 from the thousands place.
   - Thousands: After borrowing, it is $2 - 7 $ which requires another borrow, so it becomes$12 - 7 = 5$, borrow 1 from the ten thousands place.
   - Ten thousands: After borrowing, it is $4 - 8 $ requires another borrow, so it becomes$14 - 8 = 6$.
   - Hundred thousands: After borrowing, it is $0 - 9 $ which requires a borrow, so it becomes$10 - 9 = 1$.

Therefore, the difference is:
$$6,052,387 - 987,654 = 5,064,733$$x??

#### Finding Prime Factors for Larger Numbers
To find the prime factorization of larger numbers, start with smaller primes and divide until you can’t divide further by any other prime.

:p How do you find the prime factors of a large number?
??x
You begin with small primes like 2, then proceed to higher primes if necessary. For example, for 147:
- Divide by 3: $147 / 3 = 49 $- Factor 49: Since it’s not divisible by 2, try 3 (it isn’t), then 5 (it isn’t), and finally 7:$49 = 7 \times 7 $ Thus, the prime factorization of 147 is$3 \times 7 \times 7 $ or$3 \times 7^2$.
x??

---

#### Determining Prime Numbers
A prime number has only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. For example, 37 is a prime number because it can only be divided by 1 and 37.

Yes, 37 is a prime number since its only factors are 1 and 37.
x??

---

#### Finding Factors of a Number
Factors are numbers that can be multiplied together to produce a given product. For example, for 158, the factors are 2, 79, 1158, and 279.

:p What is a factor?
??x
A factor is a number that divides another number evenly (with no remainder). For 158, the complete set of factors includes both smaller pairs like $2 \times 79 $ and larger numbers like$1158 = 2 \times 23 \times 25.3$, but only 2 and 79 are directly paired without further factorization.
x??

---

#### Direct Proportionality
Direct proportionality means that as one quantity increases, the other does so in a fixed ratio. For example, if $7 $ is proportional to$28 $, it implies a multiplication by $4$.

:p What is direct proportionality?
??x
Direct proportionality indicates that two quantities increase or decrease at a constant rate relative to each other. If 7 is directly proportional to 28, this means the factor of proportionality is 4 (since $7 \times 4 = 28$). To find the unknown proportional in another scenario, multiply by the same factor.

#### Proportion Problem

Background context: This problem involves finding a proportional relationship between two quantities. The given information states that 48 large flowers are needed to make 6 wreaths, and you need to determine how many large flowers are required for 18 wreaths.

:p What is the number of large flowers needed for 18 wreaths?
??x
To solve this problem, we can set up a proportion based on the given information. The ratio of wreaths to flowers is $\frac{48}{6}$, which simplifies to $\frac{8}{1}$. For 18 wreaths, you need to multiply both sides of the proportion by 3 because $\frac{6}{18} = \frac{1}{3}$.

$$\frac{48}{6} = \frac{x}{18}$$

Cross-multiplying gives:
$$48 \times 18 = x \times 6$$

Solving for $x$:

$$x = \frac{48 \times 18}{6} = 48 \times 3 = 144$$

So, you need 144 large flowers.

??x
You need 144 large flowers to make 18 wreaths.
x??

#### Ratio and Scaling Down

Background context: The problem involves scaling down a recipe from serving nine troops to three troops. The initial ratio of chicken to potatoes is 9:12, but you are only feeding a third of the original amount.

:p What is the new ratio of chicken to potatoes for three troops?
??x
To find the new ratio, we need to scale down both parts of the original ratio by $\frac{1}{3}$.

Original ratio: 9:12

Dividing each part by 3:

$$\frac{9}{3} : \frac{12}{3} = 3 : 4$$

So, the new ratio is 3:4.

??x
The new ratio of chicken to potatoes for three troops is 3:4.
x??

#### Composite Number

Background context: A composite number is a whole number that has more than two factors. Specifically, it can be divided evenly by itself, 1, and at least one other whole number.

:p What defines a composite number?
??x

#### Round-Trip Distance
Round-trip problems often require setting up equations for each leg of a journey and solving them together. This involves understanding that the distance is the same in both directions.

:p How far does Ilhan live from work if he travels at different speeds on his way to and from work?
??x
Let $t$ be the time in hours it takes for Ilhan to travel to work:
- Distance to work:$36t $- Distance from work:$27(175 - t)$ Since the distances are equal:
$$36t = 27(175 - t)$$
$$36t = 4725 - 27t$$
$$63t = 4725$$
$$t = \frac{4725}{63}$$
$$t = 75$$

Distance to work:
$$d = 36 \times 75 = 2700 / 10 = 27 \text{ miles}$$

So, Ilhan lives 27 miles from his workplace.

??x
Let $t$ be the time in hours until they meet:
- Distance Ayanna travels:$65t $- Distance Cori travels:$70t$ Total distance covered:
$$65t + 70t = 135t$$

Since their combined speed is 135 miles per hour, the equation simplifies to:
$$135t = 270$$
$$t = \frac{270}{135} = 2 \text{ hours}$$

So, it will take them 2 hours to meet.
