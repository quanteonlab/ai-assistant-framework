#### Vocabulary Lessons
Vocabulary lessons are crucial for improving your performance in the Word Knowledge subtest. Understanding roots, prefixes, and suffixes can help you decode unfamiliar words and distinguish between synonyms and antonyms.

:p What are the primary components of vocabulary that are important for the Word Knowledge subtest?
??x
The primary components include:
- Roots: The base part of a word.
- Prefixes: A group of letters added to the beginning of a root that changes its meaning.
- Suffixes: A group of letters added to the end of a root that modifies or extends its meaning.

For example, in the word "uncommunicative":
- Un (prefix) means not.
- Communicative is derived from "communicate" (root).
- -ive (suffix) indicates the quality or action associated with the verb.

Understanding these components helps you break down complex words and identify their meanings.
