#### Units of Measurement and Conversion
Background context explaining that this question involves converting between units, specifically square feet to square yards for carpeting.

:p A carpet stain protector costs $0.65 per square yard to apply. How much will it cost to apply the protector to a 16-foot-x-18-foot carpet?
??x
First, we need to convert the area from square feet to square yards.
\[ \text{Area in square yards} = \frac{\text{Area in square feet}}{9} \]
The area of the carpet is:
\[ 16 \times 18 = 288 \text{ square feet} \]
Converting this to square yards:
\[ \text{Square yards} = \frac{288}{9} = 32 \text{ square yards} \]
Now, we can find the cost by multiplying the area in square yards by the cost per square yard.
\[ \text{Cost} = 32 \times 0.65 \]

??x
The calculation is:
\[ 32 \times 0.65 = 20.80 \]
So, the answer is \(C\) or $20.80.

??x
The cost to apply the protector is \(C\) or $20.80.

#### Cost Analysis and Profit Calculation
Background context explaining that this question involves calculating profit based on given costs and selling prices per unit.

:p A printing plant has a monthly overhead of $6,000. It costs 18 cents to print each card, and the cards sell for 30 cents each. How many cards must the printing plant sell each month in order to make a profit?
??x
To find out how many cards need to be sold to break even, we first calculate the cost per card:
\[ \text{Cost per card} = \$0.18 \]
The selling price per card is $0.30.

To break even, the total revenue should equal the total cost.
Let \(x\) be the number of cards that need to be sold. The equation for breaking even is:
\[ 0.30x - 6000 = 0.18x \]
Solving for \(x\):
\[ 0.30x - 0.18x = 6000 \]
\[ 0.12x = 6000 \]
\[ x = \frac{6000}{0.12} \]
\[ x = 50,000 \]

??x
The answer is \(B\) or 50,000 cards.

#### Percentage and Wage Adjustments
Background context explaining that this question involves calculating a new wage after a percentage increase.

:p Joe received an hourly wage of $8.15. His boss gave him a 7 percent raise. How much does Joe make per hour now?
??x
To find the new wage, we need to calculate 7% of the original wage and add it to the original wage.
\[ \text{Raise} = 8.15 \times 0.07 \]
\[ \text{New Wage} = 8.15 + (8.15 \times 0.07) \]

??x
The calculation is:
\[ 8.15 \times 0.07 = 0.5705 \]
Adding this to the original wage:
\[ 8.15 + 0.5705 = 8.7205 \]
Rounding to two decimal places, we get $8.72.

??x
Joe's new hourly wage is \(C\) or $8.72.

#### Speed and Distance Problems
Background context explaining that this question involves using the formula for distance: distance = speed × time.

:p A train headed south for Wichita left the station at the same time a train headed north for Des Moines left the same station. The train headed for Wichita traveled at 55 miles per hour, and the train headed for Des Moines traveled at 70 miles per hour. How many miles apart are the trains at the end of 3 hours?
??x
To find out how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train travels in that time and then add those distances together.

For the train headed for Wichita:
\[ \text{Distance} = 55 \times 3 = 165 \text{ miles} \]

For the train headed for Des Moines:
\[ \text{Distance} = 70 \times 3 = 210 \text{ miles} \]

Adding these distances gives us the total distance between them.

??x
The total distance is:
\[ 165 + 210 = 375 \text{ miles} \]
So, the answer is \(D\) or 375 miles.
x??

---

#### Time and Work Problems
Background context explaining that this question involves calculating time spent traveling a certain distance at a given speed.

:p A recruiter travels 1,100 miles during a 40-hour workweek. If they spend \(\frac{2}{5}\) of their time traveling, how many hours do they spend traveling?
??x
To find out the number of hours spent traveling, we need to calculate \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the total working hours.

\[ \text{Total working hours} = 40 \]
\[ \text{Hours spent traveling} = \frac{2}{5} \times 40 \]

??x
The calculation is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 40 = 16 \]
So, the recruiter spends \(16\) hours traveling.

??x
The answer is \(A\) or 16 hours.
x??

---

#### Unit Conversion and Cost Calculation
Background context explaining that this question involves converting units and performing cost calculations for gasoline usage.

:p Your car uses gasoline at the rate of 21 miles per gallon. If gasoline costs $2.82 per gallon, and you drive for 7 hours at a speed of 48 miles per hour, how much will you pay for gasoline for the trip?
??x
First, we need to determine the total distance driven:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 48 \times 7 = 336 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate how many gallons of gasoline are used. Using the rate of 21 miles per gallon:
\[ \text{Gallons used} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Rate}} = \frac{336}{21} = 16 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost of gasoline:
\[ \text{Cost} = \text{Gallons used} \times \text{Price per gallon} = 16 \times 2.82 \]

??x
The calculation is:
\[ 16 \times 2.82 = 45.12 \]
So, the answer is \(B\) or $45.12.
