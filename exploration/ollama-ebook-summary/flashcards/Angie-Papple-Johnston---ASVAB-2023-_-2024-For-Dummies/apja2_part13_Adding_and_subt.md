#### Converting Improper Fractions to Mixed Numbers
Background context: An improper fraction is a fraction with a numerator larger than or equal to its denominator. To simplify an improper fraction, it can be converted into a mixed number (a combination of a whole number and a proper fraction). The process involves dividing the numerator by the denominator.

:p How do you convert an improper fraction like 7/3 into a mixed number?
??x
To convert 7/3 to a mixed number, divide the numerator by the denominator. Here, 7 divided by 3 gives a quotient of 2 with a remainder of 1. The remainder becomes the new numerator over the original denominator: 
- Quotient = 2
- Remainder = 1
Therefore, $\frac{7}{3} = 2\frac{1}{3}$.

??x
The answer includes detailed steps:
To convert an improper fraction like $\frac{7}{3}$ to a mixed number:

1. Divide the numerator (7) by the denominator (3).
2. The quotient is 2 and the remainder is 1.
3. Use the remainder as the new numerator over the original denominator: 
   - Quotient = 2
   - Remainder = 1

Thus, $\frac{7}{3}$ becomes $2\frac{1}{3}$.

#### Converting Mixed Numbers to Improper Fractions
Background context: To perform operations like multiplication or division on mixed numbers, they must first be converted into improper fractions. The process involves converting the whole number part of the mixed number into a fraction and then adding it to the existing fractional part.

:p How do you convert 72/3 (or 7 2/3) back to an improper fraction?
??x
To convert $7\frac{2}{3}$ into an improper fraction, follow these steps:

1. Multiply the whole number (7) by the denominator (3): 
   - $7 \times 3 = 21$
2. Place this new numerator over the existing denominator: 
   - $\frac{21}{3}$
3. Add this fraction to the original fractional part:
   - $\frac{21}{3} + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{21+2}{3} = \frac{23}{3}$ Thus,$7\frac{2}{3}$ as an improper fraction is $\frac{23}{3}$.

??x
The answer includes detailed steps:
To convert the mixed number $7\frac{2}{3}$ to an improper fraction:

1. Multiply the whole number (7) by the denominator (3): 
   - $7 \times 3 = 21$
2. Place this new numerator over the existing denominator: 
   - $\frac{21}{3}$
3. Add this fraction to the original fractional part:
   - $\frac{21}{3} + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{21+2}{3} = \frac{23}{3}$ Thus,$7\frac{2}{3}$ as an improper fraction is $\frac{23}{3}$.

#### Converting Fractions to Decimals
Background context: A fraction can be expressed in decimal form by dividing the numerator by the denominator. Repeating decimals may occur when the division does not result in a whole number.

:p How do you convert 3/5 into a decimal?
??x
To convert $\frac{3}{5}$ to a decimal, divide the numerator (3) by the denominator (5):
- $3 ÷ 5 = 0.6 $ Thus,$\frac{3}{5} = 0.6$.

??x
The answer includes detailed steps:
To convert the fraction $\frac{3}{5}$ to a decimal:

1. Divide the numerator (3) by the denominator (5):
   - $3 ÷ 5 = 0.6 $ Thus,$\frac{3}{5} = 0.6$.

#### Converting Decimals to Percents
Background context: To convert a decimal into a percent, move the decimal point two places to the right and add a percentage sign (%). This is because a percent represents a part per hundred.

:p How do you convert 0.6 into a percent?
??x
To convert $0.6$ to a percent, follow these steps:

1. Move the decimal point two places to the right:
   - Moving from $0.6 $ to$60$
2. Add a percentage sign (%):
   - Thus, $0.6 = 60\%$ Thus,$0.6 $ as a percent is$60\%$.

??x
The answer includes detailed steps:
To convert the decimal $0.6$ to a percent:

1. Move the decimal point two places to the right: 
   - Moving from $0.6 $ to$60$
2. Add a percentage sign (%):
   - Thus, $0.6 = 60\%$ Thus,$0.6 $ as a percent is$60\%$.

#### Adding and Subtracting Decimals
Background context: To add or subtract decimals, you align them by their decimal points and then perform the operations as if they were whole numbers. This ensures that you maintain the correct place value for each digit.

:p How do you add or subtract decimals?
??x
Align the numbers vertically so that the decimal points are in the same column. Then, add or subtract the digits starting from the rightmost digit just as you would with whole numbers. The decimal point of your answer should be directly below the other decimal points.
For example:
```
  14583
+ 05500
-------
  20083
```

To make it easier, add zeros to the end if necessary.

#### Multiplying Decimals
Background context: When multiplying decimals, you first ignore the decimal points and multiply as if they were whole numbers. After finding the product, count the total number of decimal places in both factors and place the decimal point in your answer so that it has the same total number of decimal places.

:p How do you multiply decimals?
??x
First, treat the decimals as whole numbers for multiplication. Then, count the total number of digits after the decimal points in both multiplicands (the numbers being multiplied). Place the decimal point in the product so that there are this many digits to the right of the decimal point.

For example:
```
  3772
x   8
------
105664
```

Since 3.77 has two decimal places and 2.8 has one, the total is three decimal places. So, place the decimal point in 105664 to get 10.566.

If you run out of digits, add zeros as placeholders before placing the decimal point.

#### Dividing Decimals by Whole Numbers
Background context: To divide a decimal by a whole number, move the decimal point in the dividend (the number being divided) to make it a whole number. Perform the division on this new number and then place the decimal point back in the quotient based on how many places you moved the decimal.

:p How do you divide a decimal by a whole number?
??x
Move the decimal point in the dividend as far right as necessary to convert it into a whole number, keeping track of how many places you move it. Then, perform the division operation. After getting your answer, place the decimal point back in the quotient so that it has the same number of decimal places as the original dividend.

For example:
```
1254 ÷ 4
```

Move the decimal point two places to the right: $125 \div 4 = 31.25$.

Since we moved the decimal point two places, place it back in the quotient:

```
0.3125
```

#### Dividing Decimals by Decimals
Background context: When dividing one decimal by another, both numbers are converted to whole numbers first. This is achieved by moving the decimal points of both the divisor and dividend the same number of places so that the divisor becomes a whole number. The quotient then gets placed with the correct number of decimal places based on these movements.

:p How do you divide decimals by other decimals?
??x
Convert both the divisor and dividend to whole numbers by moving their decimal points rightward the same number of places. For example, if dividing 0.15 by 0.25:

Move the decimal point in the divisor (0.25) two places: $25$.

Then, move the decimal point in the dividend (0.15) two places as well: $15$.

Now divide these whole numbers: $15 ÷ 25 = 0.60$.

#### Understanding Percents
Background context: A percent is a fraction based on one-hundredths. It can be converted to a decimal or fraction by moving the decimal point two places to the left, adding zeros as needed. The ASVAB often tests your ability to calculate percents in various real-world scenarios.
:p How do you convert 35% to a decimal?
??x
To convert 35% to a decimal, follow these steps:
1. Remove the percent sign (35).
2. Move the decimal point two places to the left: 0.35.
Therefore, 35% is equivalent to 0.35 in decimal form.

#### Adding and Subtracting with Percents
Background context: To perform operations like addition or subtraction using percents, you first convert them into fractions or decimals before applying arithmetic rules.
:p What is the result of adding 12% and 8%?
??x
To add 12% and 8%, follow these steps:
1. Convert both percentages to decimals: 12% = 0.12, 8% = 0.08.
2. Add the decimal equivalents: 0.12 + 0.08 = 0.20.
3. Convert the result back to a percent (optional): 0.20 is equivalent to 20%.
Therefore, 12% + 8% equals 20% or 0.20 in decimal form.

#### Multiplying and Dividing with Percents
Background context: For multiplication and division involving percents, convert the percentages into fractions or decimals first. Then apply arithmetic operations on these values before converting back to a percentage if necessary.
:p How do you calculate 45% of 200?
??x
To find 45% of 200:
1. Convert 45% to decimal form: 45% = 0.45.
2. Multiply the decimal by the number: 0.45 * 200 = 90.
Therefore, 45% of 200 is 90.

#### Dividing with Percents
Background context: When dividing percents, first convert them to decimals or fractions and then apply the division operation. This process is often used in financial calculations, such as determining interest rates or discounts.
:p If you have an increase of 25% on a number, how do you calculate it?
??x
To calculate an increase of 25%:
1. Convert 25% to its decimal form: 25% = 0.25.
2. Multiply the original number by this decimal: If the original number is $N $, then the increased value is $ N * (1 + 0.25) = N * 1.25$.
Therefore, a 25% increase on any number $N$ results in multiplying it by 1.25.

#### Ratios: Comparing Quantities
Background context: A ratio shows the relationship between two quantities. You can express ratios as fractions or by using colons. The ASVAB may require you to interpret and solve problems involving ratios, such as comparing investment amounts or calculating rates like speed or gas mileage.
:p How do you simplify the ratio 30:60?
??x
To simplify the ratio 30:60:
1. Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of both numbers. The GCD of 30 and 60 is 30.
2. Divide both numbers by their GCD: $\frac{30}{30} : \frac{60}{30} = 1 : 2$.
Therefore, the simplified form of the ratio 30:60 is 1:2.

#### Scale Drawings
Background context: Scale drawings are used to represent real-world objects or spaces in a smaller or larger size. The scale indicates the relationship between the actual dimensions and those on the drawing. On the ASVAB, you may need to calculate distances or lengths based on given scales.
:p If a map has a scale of 1 inch to 50 miles, how many inches represent 250 miles?
??x
To solve this:
1. Understand the given scale: 1 inch represents 50 miles.
2. Determine the number of inches for 250 miles: $\frac{250 \text{ miles}}{50 \text{ miles/inch}} = 5 \text{ inches}$.
Therefore, on a map with a scale of 1 inch to 50 miles, 250 miles would be represented by 5 inches.

#### Rates: Speed and Gas Mileage
Background context: Rates such as speed or gas mileage can be calculated using ratios. For example, if you travel 240 miles with 15 gallons of fuel, the rate (gas mileage) is given by dividing the distance traveled by the amount of fuel used.
:p How do you calculate your car's gas mileage from a 240-mile trip using 15 gallons?
??x
To calculate gas mileage:
1. Use the formula for miles per gallon: $\frac{\text{miles driven}}{\text{gallons used}}$.
2. Plug in the values: $\frac{240 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ gallons}} = 16 \text{ miles/gallon}$.
Therefore, your car's gas mileage for a trip of 240 miles using 15 gallons is 16 miles per gallon.
