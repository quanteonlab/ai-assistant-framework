#### Inclined Plane Calculation

To determine how an inclined plane reduces effort, the formula is: 
\[ \text{Length of Ramp} / \text{Height of Ramp} = \text{Weight of Object} / \text{Force} \]

#### Hydraulic Jack Force Calculation

A hydraulic jack uses an incompressible fluid to maintain equal pressure throughout the system. The force at the output end is five times the applied force because the area at the output end of the jack is five times the area where James applies the force.

Centrifugal force is not a real force but rather an apparent force resulting from the inertia of objects moving in circles. When a car turns, for example, your body tends to move outward as it continues on its original path.
