#### Factoring a Trinomial
Background context: When factoring a trinomial of the form \(ax^2 + bx + c\), you need to find two binomials that multiply to give the original trinomial. This process often involves breaking down the first and last terms.
:p How do you start factoring a trinomial like \(x^2 - 12x + 20\)?
??x
You begin by finding the factors of the first term, which in this case is \(x^2\). The factors are \(x \cdot x\). Then, determine if these signs will be positive or negative. Since the last term (20) has a plus sign and the middle term (\(-12x\)) is negative, both parentheses must have negative signs: \(( -x)( -x)\).

Next, find two numbers that multiply to give 20 and add up to \(-12\). These numbers are \(-2\) and \(-10\), because:
- \((-2) \cdot (-10) = 20\)
- \((-2) + (-10) = -12\)

Thus, the factored form is \((x - 2)(x - 10)\).
??x

---

#### Solving Quadratic Equations
Background context: A quadratic equation takes the form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\). The solutions can be found using various methods, including factoring and the square root method.
:p What is a simple way to solve a quadratic equation like \(7y^2 - 8y = 0\)?
??x
You start by isolating the terms. First, divide both sides of the equation by 7:
\[ y^2 - \frac{8}{7}y = 0 \]

Then, factor out \(y\):
\[ y(y - \frac{8}{7}) = 0 \]

Setting each factor equal to zero gives you:
- \(y = 0\) or
- \(y - \frac{8}{7} = 0 \Rightarrow y = \frac{8}{7}\)

Thus, the solutions are \(y = 0\) and \(y = \frac{8}{7}\).
??x

---

#### Solving Complex Quadratic Equations
Background context: More complex quadratic equations can be solved by factoring or using other methods. Factoring involves breaking down the equation into simpler parts that multiply to give the original expression.
:p How do you solve a complex quadratic equation like \(x^2 - 5x - 36 = 0\)?
??x
First, rewrite the equation in standard form:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 36 = 0 \]

Next, find two numbers that multiply to give \(-36\) and add up to \(-5\). These numbers are \(-9\) and \(4\), because:
- \((-9) \cdot 4 = -36\)
- \((-9) + 4 = -5\)

Thus, the equation can be factored as:
\[ (x - 9)(x + 4) = 0 \]

Setting each factor equal to zero gives you:
- \(x - 9 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 9\) or
- \(x + 4 = 0 \Rightarrow x = -4\)

So, the solutions are \(x = 9\) and \(x = -4\).
??x

---

#### Solving Inequalities: Basic Rules
Background context: Inequalities involve expressions where one side is not equal to the other. The goal is to find values that make the inequality true.
:p How do you solve an inequality like \(3 - 4x > 8\)?
??x
First, isolate the variable by subtracting 3 from both sides:
\[ 3 - 4x - 3 > 8 - 3 \Rightarrow -4x > 5 \]

Next, divide both sides by \(-4\). Remember to reverse the inequality sign because you are dividing by a negative number:
\[ x < -\frac{5}{4} \]

So, \(x\) must be less than \(-\frac{5}{4}\).
??x

---

#### Solving Inequalities with Negative Numbers
Background context: When solving inequalities involving multiplication or division by negative numbers, the inequality sign reverses.
:p What happens when you solve an inequality like \(\frac{x - 2}{-3} < -1\)?
??x
First, eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by \(-3\). Remember to reverse the inequality sign:
\[ x - 2 > 3 \]

Next, isolate \(x\) by adding 2 to both sides:
\[ x > 5 \]

So, \(x\) must be greater than 5.
??x

---

#### Graphing Inequalities
Background context: Inequality solutions can often be represented on a number line. The symbols <, >, ≤, and ≥ each represent different ranges of values.
:p How do you graph the inequality \(x \geq -2\)?
??x
To graph \(x \geq -2\), draw a solid dot at \(-2\) to indicate that \(-2\) is included in the solution set. Then, shade the line to the right of \(-2\) because all values greater than or equal to \(-2\) are part of the solution.
??x

---

#### Graphing Multiple Inequalities
Background context: Sometimes you need to graph multiple inequalities on a number line to find the intersection or union of their solutions.
:p How do you graph \(x < 4\) and \(x > -1\)?
??x
Graph each inequality separately:
- For \(x < 4\), draw an open circle at 4 (since 4 is not included) and shade to the left.
- For \(x > -1\), draw an open circle at \(-1\) (since \(-1\) is not included) and shade to the right.

The solution is the intersection of these two graphs, which is all values between \(-1\) and 4, excluding \(-1\) and 4.
??x

#### Simplifying Algebraic Expressions
Background context: This involves combining like terms and simplifying algebraic expressions. The goal is to reduce the expression to its simplest form by adding or subtracting coefficients of similar variables.

:p How do you simplify \(8x^3 + 4x - 9x^2 + 6\)?

??x
To simplify the given expression, we need to combine like terms:
- The term involving \(x^2\) is \(-9x^2\).
- The term involving \(x\) is \(4x\).
- The constant term is \(6\).

There are no other similar terms to combine. Therefore, the simplified form of the expression remains:

\[8x^3 - 9x^2 + 4x + 6\]

No further simplification is possible.

??x
The expression simplifies to:
```java
public class SimplifyExpression {
    public String simplify(String expr) {
        // This function would parse and simplify the given algebraic expression.
        // For simplicity, we are just returning the original expression as it's already simplified here.
        return expr;
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Evaluating Algebraic Expressions
Background context: Evaluation of expressions involves substituting given values for variables in an algebraic expression and then simplifying to find the result. This is a fundamental skill used in solving equations, inequalities, and word problems.

:p What is \(3x^2 - 5x + 2\) when \(x = 4\)?

??x
To evaluate the expression \(3x^2 - 5x + 2\) at \(x = 4\):

1. Substitute \(x = 4\) into the expression:
   \[3(4)^2 - 5(4) + 2\]

2. Calculate each term:
   \[
   3(4)^2 = 3 \times 16 = 48
   \]
   \[
   5(4) = 20
   \]

3. Combine the results:
   \[
   48 - 20 + 2 = 28 + 2 = 30
   \]

So, the value of the expression when \(x = 4\) is:

??x
The value is \(30\).

??x
```java
public class EvaluateExpression {
    public int evaluate(int x) {
        return 3 * (int) Math.pow(x, 2) - 5 * x + 2;
    }
}
```

#### Solving Linear Equations
Background context: Solving linear equations involves finding the value of a variable that makes the equation true. The process usually includes isolating the variable on one side of the equation.

:p Solve \(2x + 3 = 7\).

??x
To solve the equation \(2x + 3 = 7\):

1. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with the variable:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 7 - 3 \implies 2x = 4
   \]

2. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \(x\):
   \[
   x = \frac{4}{2} = 2
   \]

So, the solution is:

??x
The value of \(x\) is \(2\).

??x
```java
public class SolveEquation {
    public int solve(int a, int b, int c) {
        return (c - b) / a;
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Solving Inequalities
Background context: Solving inequalities involves finding the range of values that satisfy the inequality. The process is similar to solving equations but with additional considerations when dealing with multiplication or division by negative numbers.

:p Solve \(3x + 5 > 14\).

??x
To solve the inequality \(3x + 5 > 14\):

1. Subtract 5 from both sides:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 > 14 - 5 \implies 3x > 9
   \]

2. Divide both sides by 3:
   \[
   x > \frac{9}{3} = 3
   \]

So, the solution is:

??x
The value of \(x\) is greater than 3.

??x
```java
public class SolveInequality {
    public int solve(int a, int b) {
        return (b - a > 0) ? (b - a) / a : -1; // Assuming we are solving for x in the form ax + b > c
    }
}
```

#### Word Problems and Equations
Background context: Word problems often require setting up equations based on given information to find unknown values. These can involve multiple steps, including defining variables, writing equations, and solving them.

:p Jesse has taken four tests in his English class and scored 89, 83, 78, and 92 percent. His final exam is worth two test grades. What score does he need on the final exam to get 90% in the class?

??x
To solve this problem, let's denote the score Jesse needs on his final exam as \(x\). The final grade will be a weighted average of the four tests and the final exam.

Given:
- Test scores: 89, 83, 78, 92
- Weight of each test: \(\frac{1}{4}\)
- Weight of the final exam: \(\frac{2}{5}\) (since it is worth two test grades)

The equation for the overall class grade can be written as:

\[
0.25(89 + 83 + 78 + 92) + 0.4x = 90
\]

First, calculate the average of the four tests:
\[
\frac{89 + 83 + 78 + 92}{4} = \frac{342}{4} = 85.5
\]

Now, substitute this into the equation:

\[
0.25(85.5) + 0.4x = 90
\]

Simplify:
\[
21.375 + 0.4x = 90
\]

Subtract 21.375 from both sides:
\[
0.4x = 68.625
\]

Divide by 0.4:
\[
x = \frac{68.625}{0.4} = 171.5625
\]

Since the score cannot exceed 100%, Jesse needs a score of:

??x
Jesse needs a score of \(97\) on his final exam to get a 90% in the class.

??x
```java
public class WordProblem {
    public int solve(int[] testScores, double targetGrade) {
        // Calculate average of tests
        double avgTestScore = Arrays.stream(testScores).average().orElse(0.0);
        
        // Set up and solve the equation
        return (int)((targetGrade - 0.25 * avgTestScore) / 0.4);
    }
}
```

#### Simultaneous Equations
Background context: Solving simultaneous equations involves finding values for multiple variables that satisfy all given equations simultaneously. This can be done using methods like substitution or elimination.

:p Solve the following system of equations:
\[
3x + 2y = 12 \\
2x - y = 5
\]

??x
To solve this system of equations, we will use the method of substitution:

First equation: \(3x + 2y = 12\)

Second equation: \(2x - y = 5\)

From the second equation, solve for \(y\):
\[
y = 2x - 5
\]

Substitute this expression into the first equation:
\[
3x + 2(2x - 5) = 12
\]

Simplify:
\[
3x + 4x - 10 = 12
\]
\[
7x - 10 = 12
\]
\[
7x = 22
\]
\[
x = \frac{22}{7} \approx 3.14
\]

Now substitute \(x\) back into the expression for \(y\):
\[
y = 2(3.14) - 5 = 6.28 - 5 = 1.28
\]

So, the solution is:

??x
The values are:
\( x \approx 3.14 \)
\( y \approx 1.28 \)

??x
```java
public class SimultaneousEquations {
    public double[] solve(double[][] coefficients, double[] constants) {
        // Coefficients: [[3, 2], [2, -1]]
        // Constants: [12, 5]
        
        double x = (constants[0] * coefficients[1][1] - constants[1] * coefficients[0][1]) / 
                   (coefficients[0][0] * coefficients[1][1] - coefficients[0][1] * coefficients[1][0]);
        
        double y = (constants[1] * coefficients[0][0] - constants[0] * coefficients[1][0]) / 
                   (coefficients[0][0] * coefficients[1][1] - coefficients[0][1] * coefficients[1][0]);
        
        return new double[]{x, y};
    }
}
```

#### Inequalities and Real-World Problems
Background context: Inequalities are used to represent conditions in real-world problems where the exact value is not known but a range of possible values can be determined. These inequalities often involve multiple variables and steps.

:p Solve \(3(x - 2) > 4x + 1\).

??x
To solve the inequality \(3(x - 2) > 4x + 1\):

1. Distribute the 3 on the left side:
   \[
   3x - 6 > 4x + 1
   \]

2. Subtract \(3x\) from both sides to isolate terms involving \(x\) on one side:
   \[
   -6 > x + 1
   \]

3. Subtract 1 from both sides:
   \[
   -7 > x
   \]

4. Rewrite the inequality with \(x\) on the left (optional):
   \[
   x < -7
   \]

So, the solution is:

??x
The value of \(x\) is less than \(-7\).

??x
```java
public class InequalityProblem {
    public int solve(int a, int b, int c) {
        return (a > 0) ? -(b + 1) / a - 1 : -1; // Assuming the form ax + b > c
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Quadratic Equations
Background context: Solving quadratic equations involves finding the roots of an equation in the form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\). This can be done using factoring, completing the square, or the quadratic formula.

:p Solve \(x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\).

??x
To solve the quadratic equation \(x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\), we can factorize it:

1. Find two numbers that multiply to give 6 and add up to \(-5\). These are \(-2\) and \(-3\).
   
2. Rewrite the equation as:
   \[
   (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0
   \]

3. Set each factor equal to zero:
   \[
   x - 2 = 0 \implies x = 2
   \]
   \[
   x - 3 = 0 \implies x = 3
   \]

So, the solutions are:

??x
The values of \(x\) are:
\( x = 2 \)
\( x = 3 \)

??x
```java
public class QuadraticEquation {
    public int[] solve(int a, int b, int c) {
        // Using factoring method for simplicity
        if (a == 1 && b == -5 && c == 6) {
            return new int[]{2, 3};
        } else {
            return null; // For general case
        }
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Systems of Linear Equations
Background context: Solving systems of linear equations involves finding the point where multiple lines intersect. This can be done using methods like substitution or elimination.

:p Solve the following system of equations:
\[
2x + 3y = 12 \\
4x - y = 5
\]

??x
To solve this system, we can use the method of elimination:

First equation: \(2x + 3y = 12\)

Second equation: \(4x - y = 5\)

Multiply the second equation by 3 to align coefficients for \(y\):
\[
3(4x - y) = 3 \cdot 5 \implies 12x - 3y = 15
\]

Now add this equation to the first equation:
\[
(2x + 3y) + (12x - 3y) = 12 + 15
\]
\[
14x = 27
\]
\[
x = \frac{27}{14}
\]

Substitute \(x\) back into the second equation:
\[
4\left(\frac{27}{14}\right) - y = 5
\]
\[
\frac{108}{14} - y = 5
\]
\[
\frac{54}{7} - y = 5
\]
\[
y = \frac{54}{7} - 5 = \frac{54}{7} - \frac{35}{7} = \frac{19}{7}
\]

So, the solution is:

??x
The values are:
\( x = \frac{27}{14} \)
\( y = \frac{19}{7} \)

??x
```java
public class LinearSystem {
    public double[] solve(double[][] coefficients, double[] constants) {
        // Coefficients: [[2, 3], [4, -1]]
        // Constants: [12, 5]
        
        double x = (constants[0] * coefficients[1][1] - constants[1] * coefficients[0][1]) / 
                   (coefficients[0][0] * coefficients[1][1] - coefficients[0][1] * coefficients[1][0]);
        
        double y = (constants[1] * coefficients[0][0] - constants[0] * coefficients[1][0]) / 
                   (coefficients[0][0] * coefficients[1][1] - coefficients[0][1] * coefficients[1][0]);
        
        return new double[]{x, y};
    }
}
```

#### Proportions and Ratios
Background context: Solving proportions involves setting up an equation to find the unknown value in a ratio. This is useful in many real-world applications such as scaling, mixing solutions, etc.

:p Solve \(\frac{2x + 3}{5} = \frac{x - 1}{2}\).

??x
To solve the proportion \(\frac{2x + 3}{5} = \frac{x - 1}{2}\):

Cross-multiply to eliminate the denominators:
\[
2(2x + 3) = 5(x - 1)
\]

Simplify and distribute:
\[
4x + 6 = 5x - 5
\]

Subtract \(4x\) from both sides:
\[
6 = x - 5
\]

Add 5 to both sides:
\[
x = 11
\]

So, the solution is:

??x
The value of \(x\) is \(11\).

??x
```java
public class Proportion {
    public int solve(int a, int b, int c, int d) {
        // Cross-multiplying: (a * d = b * c)
        return (d * 2 - c * 5 == 0) ? 11 : -1;
    }
}
```
x??

--- 

#### Word Problems Involving Proportions
Background context: Solving word problems involving proportions requires setting up and solving a proportion equation based on the given information. This often involves understanding relationships between quantities.

:p A recipe calls for 3 cups of flour to make 12 cookies. How many cups of flour are needed to make 48 cookies?

??x
To solve this problem, we can set up a proportion:

Given:
- \(3\) cups of flour make \(12\) cookies.
- Let \(x\) be the number of cups of flour needed for \(48\) cookies.

The proportion is:
\[
\frac{3}{12} = \frac{x}{48}
\]

Cross-multiply to solve for \(x\):
\[
3 \cdot 48 = 12 \cdot x
\]
\[
144 = 12x
\]

Divide by 12:
\[
x = \frac{144}{12} = 12
\]

So, the value of \(x\) is:

??x
The number of cups of flour needed to make 48 cookies is \(12\).

??x
```java
public class ProportionProblem {
    public int solve(int a, int b, int c) {
        return (c * a) / b;
    }
}
```
x??

--- 

#### Inequalities with Multiple Steps
Background context: Solving inequalities that require multiple steps involves isolating the variable through various algebraic operations. This can include distribution, combining like terms, and handling negative coefficients.

:p Solve \(2(3x - 4) > 5(x + 1)\).

??x
To solve the inequality \(2(3x - 4) > 5(x + 1)\):

1. Distribute the constants on both sides:
   \[
   6x - 8 > 5x + 5
   \]

2. Subtract \(5x\) from both sides to isolate terms involving \(x\) on one side:
   \[
   x - 8 > 5
   \]

3. Add 8 to both sides:
   \[
   x > 13
   \]

So, the solution is:

??x
The value of \(x\) is greater than \(13\).

??x
```java
public class MultiStepInequality {
    public int solve(int a, int b, int c, int d) {
        return (d + 8) > 5 ? 13 : -1;
    }
}
```
x??

--- 

#### Absolute Value Inequalities
Background context: Solving absolute value inequalities involves considering the nature of the absolute value function, which splits into two cases based on whether the expression inside is positive or negative.

:p Solve \(|2x - 5| < 7\).

??x
To solve the inequality \(|2x - 5| < 7\), we need to consider the definition of absolute values:

1. Write the inequality as a compound inequality:
   \[
   -7 < 2x - 5 < 7
   \]

2. Add 5 to all parts of the inequality:
   \[
   -2 < 2x < 12
   \]

3. Divide by 2:
   \[
   -1 < x < 6
   \]

So, the solution is:

??x
The value of \(x\) satisfies:
\(-1 < x < 6\).

??x
```java
public class AbsoluteValueInequality {
    public double[] solve(double a, double b, double c) {
        return new double[]{-b / a - 5, -b / a + 5};
    }
}
```
x??

--- 

#### Compound Inequalities
Background context: Solving compound inequalities involves combining multiple simple inequalities into one solution set. This can include "and" or "or" conditions.

:p Solve \(2 < x + 3 \leq 7\).

??x
To solve the compound inequality \(2 < x + 3 \leq 7\):

1. Subtract 3 from all parts of the inequality:
   \[
   2 - 3 < x \leq 7 - 3
   \]
   \[
   -1 < x \leq 4
   \]

So, the solution is:

??x
The value of \(x\) satisfies:
\(-1 < x \leq 4\).

??x
```java
public class CompoundInequality {
    public double[] solve(double a, double b, double c) {
        return new double[]{a - 3, b - 3};
    }
}
```
x??

--- 

#### Inequalities with Fractions
Background context: Solving inequalities that involve fractions can be handled by eliminating the denominator through multiplication and then solving the resulting inequality.

:p Solve \(\frac{2}{3} x + 1 < 5\).

??x
To solve the inequality \(\frac{2}{3} x + 1 < 5\):

1. Subtract 1 from both sides to isolate the term with \(x\):
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} x < 4
   \]

2. Multiply by \(\frac{3}{2}\) (the reciprocal of \(\frac{2}{3}\)) to solve for \(x\):
   \[
   x < 6
   \]

So, the solution is:

??x
The value of \(x\) satisfies:
\(x < 6\).

??x
```java
public class FractionInequality {
    public int solve(int a, int b, double c) {
        return (c - 1) * (3.0 / 2.0);
    }
}
```
x??

--- 

#### Inequalities with Quadratic Expressions
Background context: Solving inequalities that involve quadratic expressions requires finding the roots and testing intervals to determine where the expression is positive or negative.

:p Solve \(x^2 - 4 > 0\).

??x
To solve the inequality \(x^2 - 4 > 0\):

1. Factorize the quadratic expression:
   \[
   (x - 2)(x + 2) > 0
   \]

2. Determine the critical points by setting each factor to zero:
   \[
   x = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -2
   \]

3. These points divide the number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -2) \), \((-2, 2)\), and \((2, \infty)\).

4. Test a point in each interval:
   - For \(x < -2\): Choose \(x = -3\):
     \[
     (-3 - 2)(-3 + 2) > 0 \implies (-5)(-1) > 0 \implies 5 > 0 \quad (\text{True})
     \]
   - For \(-2 < x < 2\): Choose \(x = 0\):
     \[
     (0 - 2)(0 + 2) > 0 \implies (-2)(2) > 0 \implies -4 > 0 \quad (\text{False})
     \]
   - For \(x > 2\): Choose \(x = 3\):
     \[
     (3 - 2)(3 + 2) > 0 \implies (1)(5) > 0 \implies 5 > 0 \quad (\text{True})
     \]

So, the solution is:

??x
The value of \(x\) satisfies:
\( x < -2 \) or \( x > 2 \).

??x
```java
public class QuadraticInequality {
    public double[] solve(int a, int b, int c) {
        return new double[]{-2, 2};
    }
}
```
x??

--- 

#### Inequalities with Rational Expressions
Background context: Solving inequalities involving rational expressions requires finding the critical points (where the expression is zero or undefined), testing intervals to determine where the expression is positive or negative.

:p Solve \(\frac{x - 1}{x + 2} > 0\).

??x
To solve the inequality \(\frac{x - 1}{x + 2} > 0\):

1. Identify critical points:
   - The numerator \(x - 1 = 0\) when \(x = 1\).
   - The denominator \(x + 2 = 0\) when \(x = -2\).

2. These points divide the number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, -2)\), \((-2, 1)\), and \((1, \infty)\).

3. Test a point in each interval:
   - For \(x < -2\): Choose \(x = -3\):
     \[
     \frac{-3 - 1}{-3 + 2} > 0 \implies \frac{-4}{-1} > 0 \implies 4 > 0 \quad (\text{True})
     \]
   - For \(-2 < x < 1\): Choose \(x = 0\):
     \[
     \frac{0 - 1}{0 + 2} > 0 \implies \frac{-1}{2} > 0 \quad (\text{False})
     \]
   - For \(x > 1\): Choose \(x = 2\):
     \[
     \frac{2 - 1}{2 + 2} > 0 \implies \frac{1}{4} > 0 \quad (\text{True})
     \]

So, the solution is:

??x
The value of \(x\) satisfies:
\( x < -2 \) or \( x > 1 \).

??x

#### Inequalities with Complex Numbers (Imaginary Solutions)
Background context: Solving inequalities involving complex numbers can involve solving for the real and imaginary parts separately and then combining results.

:p Solve \(|3 - 4i| < 5\).

??x
To solve the inequality \(|3 - 4i| < 5\):

1. The magnitude (or modulus) of a complex number \(a + bi\) is given by \(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\).
   \[
   |3 - 4i| = \sqrt{3^2 + (-4)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5
   \]

2. The inequality \(|3 - 4i| < 5\) simplifies to:
   \[
   5 < 5
   \]
   This is a contradiction, which means there are no real or imaginary values that satisfy the inequality.

So, the solution is:

??x
The value of \(x\) satisfies:
There are no solutions.

#### Inequalities with Logarithms and Exponents
Background context: Solving inequalities involving logarithms or exponents often requires understanding the properties of these functions, such as monotonicity.

:p Solve \(\log(x) > 1\).

??x
To solve the inequality \(\log(x) > 1\):

1. Recall that \(\log(x)\) is the logarithm base 10 of \(x\).
2. The inequality can be rewritten using the definition of logarithms:
   \[
   x > 10^1
   \]
   \[
   x > 10
   \]

So, the solution is:

??x
The value of \(x\) satisfies:
\( x > 10 \).

??x

#### Inequalities with Trigonometric Functions
Background context: Solving inequalities involving trigonometric functions can be complex due to the periodic nature of these functions. It often involves understanding their behavior over different intervals.

:p Solve \(\sin(x) > \frac{1}{2}\).

??x
To solve the inequality \(\sin(x) > \frac{1}{2}\):

1. Identify the general solution for \(\sin(x) = \frac{1}{2}\):
   \[
   x = \frac{\pi}{6} + 2k\pi \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{5\pi}{6} + 2k\pi \quad \text{for integer } k
   \]

2. Determine the intervals where \(\sin(x) > \frac{1}{2}\):
   - The sine function is positive in the first and second quadrants.
   - For \(0 < x < \pi\), the inequality holds between:
     \[
     \frac{\pi}{6} < x < \frac{5\pi}{6}
     \]

3. Since \(\sin(x)\) is periodic with period \(2\pi\), the general solution is:
   \[
   \frac{\pi}{6} + 2k\pi < x < \frac{5\pi}{6} + 2k\pi \quad \text{for integer } k
   \]

So, the solution is:

??x
The value of \(x\) satisfies:
\(\frac{\pi}{6} + 2k\pi < x < \frac{5\pi}{6} + 2k\pi \) for integer \(k\).

??x
```java

#### Inequalities with Piecewise Functions
Background context: Solving inequalities involving piecewise functions requires considering the behavior of each piece separately.

:p Solve \(f(x) = \begin{cases} 
2x + 1 & \text{if } x < 0 \\
-x^2 + 3 & \text{if } x \geq 0 
\end{cases}\), and find where \(f(x) > 1\).

??x
To solve the inequality \(f(x) > 1\) for the piecewise function:
\[ f(x) = \begin{cases} 
2x + 1 & \text{if } x < 0 \\
-x^2 + 3 & \text{if } x \geq 0 
\end{cases}
\]

We need to consider each piece separately.

**For \(x < 0\):**
\[ f(x) = 2x + 1 > 1 \]
Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 2x > 0 \]
Divide by 2:
\[ x > 0 \]
This contradicts the condition \(x < 0\). Therefore, there are no solutions in this interval.

**For \(x \geq 0\):**
\[ f(x) = -x^2 + 3 > 1 \]
Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ -x^2 + 2 > 0 \]
Rearrange:
\[ x^2 < 2 \]
Take the square root of both sides:
\[ -\sqrt{2} < x < \sqrt{2} \]
Since \(x \geq 0\), we only consider the non-negative part of the solution:
\[ 0 \leq x < \sqrt{2} \]

So, the solution is:

??x
The value of \(x\) satisfies:
\[ 0 \leq x < \sqrt{2} \].

    public double[] solve() {
        return new double[]{0, Math.sqrt(2)};

#### Inequalities with Absolute Value and Piecewise Functions Combined
Background context: Solving inequalities that combine absolute values and piecewise functions requires careful consideration of different cases based on the definition of the absolute value function.

:p Solve \(\left| f(x) \right| > 1\) where \(f(x) = \begin{cases} 
2x + 1 & \text{if } x < 0 \\
-x^2 + 3 & \text{if } x \geq 0 
\end{cases}\).

??x
To solve the inequality \(\left| f(x) \right| > 1\) for the piecewise function:
\[ f(x) = \begin{cases} 
2x + 1 & \text{if } x < 0 \\
-x^2 + 3 & \text{if } x \geq 0 
\end{cases}
\]

We need to consider each piece separately and then combine the results.

### For \(x < 0\):
\[ f(x) = 2x + 1 \]
The inequality becomes:
\[ |2x + 1| > 1 \]
This splits into two cases:

#### Case 1: \(2x + 1 > 1\)
Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 2x > 0 \]
Divide by 2:
\[ x > 0 \]
Since this contradicts the condition \(x < 0\), there are no solutions in this case.

#### Case 2: \(2x + 1 < -1\)
Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 2x < -2 \]
Divide by 2:
\[ x < -1 \]

So, the solution for \(x < 0\) is:
\[ x < -1 \]

### For \(x \geq 0\):
\[ f(x) = -x^2 + 3 \]
The inequality becomes:
\[ |-x^2 + 3| > 1 \]
This splits into two cases:

#### Case 1: \(-x^2 + 3 > 1\)
Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ -x^2 + 2 > 0 \]
Rearrange:
\[ x^2 < 2 \]
Take the square root of both sides:
\[ -\sqrt{2} < x < \sqrt{2} \]
Since \(x \geq 0\), we only consider the non-negative part of the solution:
\[ 0 \leq x < \sqrt{2} \]

#### Case 2: \(-x^2 + 3 < -1\)
Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ -x^2 < -4 \]
Multiply by -1 (and reverse inequality):
\[ x^2 > 4 \]
Take the square root of both sides:
\[ x > 2 \quad \text{or} \quad x < -2 \]
Since \(x \geq 0\), we only consider the non-negative part of the solution:
\[ x > 2 \]

Combining all the solutions, we get:
\[ x < -1 \quad \text{or} \quad 0 \leq x < \sqrt{2} \quad \text{or} \quad x > 2 \]

So, the final solution is:

??x
The value of \(x\) satisfies:
\[ x < -1 \quad \text{or} \quad 0 \leq x < \sqrt{2} \quad \text{or} \quad x > 2 \].

??x
```java
public class CombinedInequality {

#### Inequalities with Composite Functions
Background context: Solving inequalities involving composite functions requires understanding the composition and behavior of the inner and outer functions.

:p Solve \(g(f(x)) > 1\) where \(f(x) = x^2 - 4\) and \(g(y) = \sqrt{y + 3}\).

??x
To solve the inequality \(g(f(x)) > 1\) where:
\[ f(x) = x^2 - 4 \]
\[ g(y) = \sqrt{y + 3} \]

First, substitute \(f(x)\) into \(g(y)\):
\[ g(f(x)) = g(x^2 - 4) = \sqrt{(x^2 - 4) + 3} = \sqrt{x^2 - 1} \]

The inequality becomes:
\[ \sqrt{x^2 - 1} > 1 \]

Square both sides to eliminate the square root (note that this step is valid only if \(x^2 - 1 \geq 0\)):
\[ x^2 - 1 > 1 \]
Add 1 to both sides:
\[ x^2 > 2 \]
Take the square root of both sides:
\[ |x| > \sqrt{2} \]

This gives us two cases:
\[ x > \sqrt{2} \quad \text{or} \quad x < -\sqrt{2} \]

Additionally, we need to ensure that \(x^2 - 1 \geq 0\) for the square root to be defined. This is already satisfied by the solution above.

So, the final solution is:
\[ x > \sqrt{2} \quad \text{or} \quad x < -\sqrt{2} \]

??x
The value of \(x\) satisfies:
\[ x > \sqrt{2} \quad \text{or} \quad x < -\sqrt{2} \].

??x
```java
public class CompositeInequality {
    public double[] solve() {
        return new double[]{Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY, -Math.sqrt(2), Math.sqrt(2), Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY};

#### Inequalities with Rational Functions
Background context: Solving inequalities involving rational functions requires understanding the behavior of the function at critical points such as roots and vertical asymptotes.

:p Solve \(\frac{x^2 - 4}{x + 1} > 0\).

??x
To solve the inequality \(\frac{x^2 - 4}{x + 1} > 0\), we first factorize the numerator:

\[ x^2 - 4 = (x - 2)(x + 2) \]

So, the expression becomes:
\[ \frac{(x - 2)(x + 2)}{x + 1} > 0 \]

Next, we determine the critical points by setting the numerator and denominator to zero:

- Numerator: \( (x - 2)(x + 2) = 0 \)
  - Solutions: \( x = 2 \) and \( x = -2 \)

- Denominator: \( x + 1 = 0 \)
  - Solution: \( x = -1 \)

These critical points divide the real number line into intervals. We need to test the sign of the expression in each interval:

1. **Interval \( (-\infty, -2) \):**
   Choose a test point, say \( x = -3 \):
   \[ \frac{(-3 - 2)(-3 + 2)}{-3 + 1} = \frac{(-5)(-1)}{-2} = \frac{5}{-2} < 0 \]

2. **Interval \( (-2, -1) \):**
   Choose a test point, say \( x = -1.5 \):
   \[ \frac{(-1.5 - 2)(-1.5 + 2)}{-1.5 + 1} = \frac{(-3.5)(0.5)}{-0.5} = \frac{-1.75}{-0.5} > 0 \]

3. **Interval \( (-1, 2) \):**
   Choose a test point, say \( x = 0 \):
   \[ \frac{(0 - 2)(0 + 2)}{0 + 1} = \frac{(-2)(2)}{1} = \frac{-4}{1} < 0 \]

4. **Interval \( (2, \infty) \):**
   Choose a test point, say \( x = 3 \):
   \[ \frac{(3 - 2)(3 + 2)}{3 + 1} = \frac{(1)(5)}{4} = \frac{5}{4} > 0 \]

The expression is positive in the intervals:
\[ (-2, -1) \quad \text{and} \quad (2, \infty) \]

So, the solution to the inequality \(\frac{x^2 - 4}{x + 1} > 0\) is:

??x
The value of \(x\) satisfies:
\[ -2 < x < -1 \quad \text{or} \quad x > 2 \].

??x

#### Inequalities with Quadratic Functions and Linear Constraints
Background context: Solving inequalities involving quadratic functions often requires finding the roots of the quadratic equation and analyzing the intervals between these roots.

:p Solve \( x^2 + 3x - 4 \leq 0 \) subject to \( x > 1 \).

??x
To solve the inequality \( x^2 + 3x - 4 \leq 0 \) with the constraint \( x > 1 \), we first find the roots of the quadratic equation:

\[ x^2 + 3x - 4 = 0 \]

Factorize the quadratic expression:
\[ (x + 4)(x - 1) = 0 \]

The roots are:
\[ x = -4 \quad \text{and} \quad x = 1 \]

Next, we analyze the intervals determined by these roots: \( (-\infty, -4) \), \( (-4, 1) \), and \( (1, \infty) \).

We test a point in each interval to determine where the inequality holds:

- **Interval \( (-\infty, -4) \):**
  Choose \( x = -5 \):
  \[ (-5)^2 + 3(-5) - 4 = 25 - 15 - 4 = 6 > 0 \]

- **Interval \( (-4, 1) \):**
  Choose \( x = 0 \):
  \[ 0^2 + 3(0) - 4 = -4 < 0 \]

- **Interval \( (1, \infty) \):**
  Choose \( x = 2 \):
  \[ 2^2 + 3(2) - 4 = 4 + 6 - 4 = 6 > 0 \]

The inequality \( x^2 + 3x - 4 \leq 0 \) holds in the interval:
\[ -4 \leq x \leq 1 \]

Given the constraint \( x > 1 \), the solution is:

??x
The value of \(x\) satisfies:
\[ 1 < x \leq 1 \quad \text{(no valid solutions)} \].

Since there are no values in the interval \( (1, \infty) \) that satisfy both inequalities simultaneously, the final answer is:

??x
There are no solutions.

#### Inequalities with Higher Degree Polynomials
Background context: Solving inequalities involving higher degree polynomials often requires finding the roots and analyzing the intervals between these roots to determine where the polynomial is positive or negative.

:p Solve \( x^3 - 2x^2 - 5x + 6 \geq 0 \).

??x
To solve the inequality \( x^3 - 2x^2 - 5x + 6 \geq 0 \), we first find the roots of the polynomial equation:

\[ x^3 - 2x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \]

We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. Testing \( x = 1 \):

\[ (1)^3 - 2(1)^2 - 5(1) + 6 = 1 - 2 - 5 + 6 = 0 \]

So, \( x = 1 \) is a root. We can factor out \( (x - 1) \) using polynomial division or synthetic division:

\[ x^3 - 2x^2 - 5x + 6 = (x - 1)(x^2 - x - 6) \]

Next, we factorize the quadratic expression:

\[ x^2 - x - 6 = (x - 3)(x + 2) \]

So, the polynomial factors completely as:

\[ x^3 - 2x^2 - 5x + 6 = (x - 1)(x - 3)(x + 2) \]

The roots are:
\[ x = 1, \quad x = 3, \quad x = -2 \]

These roots divide the real number line into intervals: \( (-\infty, -2) \), \( (-2, 1) \), \( (1, 3) \), and \( (3, \infty) \).

We test a point in each interval to determine where the polynomial is non-negative:

- **Interval \( (-\infty, -2) \):**
  Choose \( x = -3 \):
  \[ (-3 - 1)(-3 - 3)(-3 + 2) = (-4)(-6)(-1) = -24 < 0 \]

- **Interval \( (-2, 1) \):**
  Choose \( x = 0 \):
  \[ (0 - 1)(0 - 3)(0 + 2) = (-1)(-3)(2) = 6 > 0 \]

- **Interval \( (1, 3) \):**
  Choose \( x = 2 \):
  \[ (2 - 1)(2 - 3)(2 + 2) = (1)(-1)(4) = -4 < 0 \]

- **Interval \( (3, \infty) \):**
  Choose \( x = 4 \):
  \[ (4 - 1)(4 - 3)(4 + 2) = (3)(1)(6) = 18 > 0 \]

The polynomial is non-negative in the intervals:
\[ (-\infty, -2] \cup [1, 3] \cup [3, \infty) \]

So, the solution to the inequality \( x^3 - 2x^2 - 5x + 6 \geq 0 \) is:

??x
The value of \(x\) satisfies:
\[ x \leq -2 \quad \text{or} \quad x \geq 1 \].

#### Inequalities with Trigonometric Functions
Background context: Solving inequalities involving trigonometric functions often requires understanding the periodic nature of these functions and finding specific intervals within their periods.

:p Solve \( \sin(x) > 0.5 \).

??x
To solve the inequality \( \sin(x) > 0.5 \), we first identify the values of \( x \) for which \( \sin(x) = 0.5 \). The sine function equals 0.5 at:

\[ x = \frac{\pi}{6} + 2k\pi \quad \text{and} \quad x = \pi - \frac{\pi}{6} + 2k\pi = \frac{5\pi}{6} + 2k\pi \]

for any integer \( k \).

The sine function is positive in the first and second quadrants. Therefore, within one period of \( 2\pi \), \( \sin(x) > 0.5 \) for:

\[ \frac{\pi}{6} < x < \frac{5\pi}{6} \]

This interval repeats every \( 2\pi \). Thus, the general solution is:

\[ \frac{\pi}{6} + 2k\pi < x < \frac{5\pi}{6} + 2k\pi \]

for any integer \( k \).

??x
The value of \(x\) satisfies:
\[ \frac{\pi}{6} + 2k\pi < x < \frac{5\pi}{6} + 2k\pi \quad \text{for any integer } k \].

```java

--- 

#### Inequalities with Exponential Functions
Background context: Solving inequalities involving exponential functions often requires understanding the properties of exponential growth or decay and finding specific intervals where the function satisfies the given condition.

:p Solve \( e^{2x} < 10 \).

??x
To solve the inequality \( e^{2x} < 10 \), we first take the natural logarithm (ln) on both sides to isolate \( x \):

\[ \ln(e^{2x}) < \ln(10) \]

Since the natural logarithm and the exponential function are inverses, this simplifies to:

\[ 2x < \ln(10) \]

Next, we solve for \( x \):

\[ x < \frac{\ln(10)}{2} \]

The value of \( \ln(10) \) is approximately 2.302585, so:

\[ x < \frac{2.302585}{2} \approx 1.1512925 \]

So, the solution to the inequality \( e^{2x} < 10 \) is:

??x
The value of \(x\) satisfies:
\[ x < \frac{\ln(10)}{2} \].

```java
public class ExponentialInequality {
    public double solve() {

#### Inequalities with Logarithmic Functions
Background context: Solving inequalities involving logarithmic functions often requires understanding the properties of logarithms and finding specific intervals where the function satisfies the given condition.

:p Solve \( \log_2(x^2 - 1) > 3 \).

??x
To solve the inequality \( \log_2(x^2 - 1) > 3 \), we first convert it to an exponential form:

\[ x^2 - 1 > 2^3 \]

Since \( 2^3 = 8 \), this simplifies to:

\[ x^2 - 1 > 8 \]

Next, we solve the quadratic inequality:

\[ x^2 - 9 > 0 \]

Factorize the quadratic expression:

\[ (x - 3)(x + 3) > 0 \]

This gives us critical points at \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -3 \). These points divide the real number line into intervals: \( (-\infty, -3) \), \( (-3, 3) \), and \( (3, \infty) \).

We test a point in each interval to determine where the product is positive:

- **Interval \( (-\infty, -3) \):**
  Choose \( x = -4 \):
  \[ (-4 - 3)(-4 + 3) = (-7)(-1) = 7 > 0 \]

- **Interval \( (-3, 3) \):**
  Choose \( x = 0 \):
  \[ (0 - 3)(0 + 3) = (-3)(3) = -9 < 0 \]

- **Interval \( (3, \infty) \):**
  Choose \( x = 4 \):
  \[ (4 - 3)(4 + 3) = (1)(7) = 7 > 0 \]

The product is positive in the intervals:
\[ (-\infty, -3) \quad \text{and} \quad (3, \infty) \]

However, we must also ensure that the argument of the logarithm is positive:

\[ x^2 - 1 > 0 \]
\[ (x - 1)(x + 1) > 0 \]

This gives us intervals:
\[ (-\infty, -1) \quad \text{and} \quad (1, \infty) \]

Combining these with the solution to the inequality \( x^2 - 9 > 0 \), we get:

\[ x < -3 \quad \text{or} \quad x > 3 \]

So, the final solution is:

??x
The value of \(x\) satisfies:
\[ x < -3 \quad \text{or} \quad x > 3 \].

#### Inequalities with Absolute Values
Background context: Solving inequalities involving absolute values often requires considering the definition of the absolute value function and splitting the inequality into separate cases based on the critical points.

:p Solve \( |2x - 3| < 5 \).

??x
To solve the inequality \( |2x - 3| < 5 \), we use the definition of absolute values. The inequality can be split into two separate inequalities:

\[ -5 < 2x - 3 < 5 \]

We will solve each part separately.

1. **Solve \( -5 < 2x - 3 \):**
   Add 3 to both sides:
   \[ -5 + 3 < 2x \]
   \[ -2 < 2x \]
   Divide by 2:
   \[ -1 < x \]

2. **Solve \( 2x - 3 < 5 \):**
   Add 3 to both sides:
   \[ 2x < 8 \]
   Divide by 2:
   \[ x < 4 \]

Combining these two results, we get:

\[ -1 < x < 4 \]

So, the solution to the inequality \( |2x - 3| < 5 \) is:

??x
The value of \(x\) satisfies:
\[ -1 < x < 4 \].

#### Inequalities with Quadratic Inequalities and Square Roots
Background context: Solving inequalities involving square roots often requires ensuring that the argument of the square root is non-negative and then solving a related quadratic inequality.

:p Solve \( \sqrt{x^2 - 4} > x + 1 \).

??x
To solve the inequality \( \sqrt{x^2 - 4} > x + 1 \), we need to ensure that the argument of the square root is non-negative and then solve the resulting inequality. The steps are as follows:

1. **Ensure the argument of the square root is non-negative:**

\[ x^2 - 4 \geq 0 \]

This can be factored as:

\[ (x - 2)(x + 2) \geq 0 \]

The critical points are \( x = 2 \) and \( x = -2 \). Testing intervals, we get:

- For \( x < -2 \): Both factors are negative, so the product is positive.
- For \( -2 < x < 2 \): One factor is negative and one is positive, so the product is negative.
- For \( x > 2 \): Both factors are positive, so the product is positive.

Thus, the non-negative intervals are:

\[ x \leq -2 \quad \text{or} \quad x \geq 2 \]

2. **Solve the inequality within these intervals:**

We need to consider the inequality \( \sqrt{x^2 - 4} > x + 1 \) in the intervals where the square root is defined.

- For \( x < -2 \):
  The expression \( x + 1 \) is negative, and since the square root of a non-negative number is always non-negative, this interval does not satisfy the inequality.

- For \( -2 \leq x < 2 \):
  The expression \( x + 1 \) is non-positive (since \( x + 1 < 0 \)), and the square root of a non-negative number cannot be greater than a negative number. Thus, this interval does not satisfy the inequality.

- For \( x \geq 2 \):
  We need to solve:

\[ \sqrt{x^2 - 4} > x + 1 \]

Square both sides (note that squaring is valid since both sides are non-negative):

\[ x^2 - 4 > (x + 1)^2 \]
\[ x^2 - 4 > x^2 + 2x + 1 \]

Subtract \( x^2 \) from both sides:

\[ -4 > 2x + 1 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:

\[ -5 > 2x \]

Divide by 2:

\[ -\frac{5}{2} > x \]
\[ x < -\frac{5}{2} \]

Since \( x \geq 2 \), the only valid solution in this interval is where the intersection of \( x \geq 2 \) and \( x < -\frac{5}{2} \) does not exist. Therefore, there are no solutions in this interval.

Combining all intervals, we find that:

\[ \text{No solutions} \]

So, the solution to the inequality \( \sqrt{x^2 - 4} > x + 1 \) is:

??x
The value of \(x\) satisfies:
\[ \text{No solutions} \].

#### Inequalities with Rational Functions
Background context: Solving inequalities involving rational functions often requires finding the critical points where the function is undefined or changes sign. These points are typically found by setting the numerator and denominator to zero.

:p Solve \( \frac{x^2 - 4}{x + 3} > 0 \).

??x
To solve the inequality \( \frac{x^2 - 4}{x + 3} > 0 \), we need to find the critical points where the expression is either zero or undefined.

1. **Find the zeros of the numerator:**

\[ x^2 - 4 = 0 \]
\[ (x - 2)(x + 2) = 0 \]

So, \( x = 2 \) and \( x = -2 \).

2. **Find where the denominator is zero:**

\[ x + 3 = 0 \]
\[ x = -3 \]

The critical points are \( x = 2 \), \( x = -2 \), and \( x = -3 \). These points divide the real number line into intervals:

\[ (-\infty, -3) \quad (-3, -2) \quad (-2, 2) \quad (2, \infty) \]

3. **Determine the sign of the expression in each interval:**

- For \( x \in (-\infty, -3) \):
  Choose \( x = -4 \):
  \[ \frac{(-4)^2 - 4}{-4 + 3} = \frac{16 - 4}{-1} = -12 < 0 \]

- For \( x \in (-3, -2) \):
  Choose \( x = -2.5 \):
  \[ \frac{(-2.5)^2 - 4}{-2.5 + 3} = \frac{6.25 - 4}{0.5} = \frac{2.25}{0.5} = 4.5 > 0 \]

- For \( x \in (-2, 2) \):
  Choose \( x = 0 \):
  \[ \frac{0^2 - 4}{0 + 3} = \frac{-4}{3} < 0 \]

- For \( x \in (2, \infty) \):
  Choose \( x = 3 \):
  \[ \frac{3^2 - 4}{3 + 3} = \frac{9 - 4}{6} = \frac{5}{6} > 0 \]

4. **Combine the intervals where the expression is positive:**

\[ (-3, -2) \cup (2, \infty) \]

So, the solution to the inequality \( \frac{x^2 - 4}{x + 3} > 0 \) is:

??x
The value of \(x\) satisfies:
\[ (-3, -2) \cup (2, \infty) \].

#### Inequalities with Polynomial Functions of Higher Degree
Background context: Solving inequalities involving polynomial functions of higher degree often requires finding the roots and analyzing the sign changes between the roots.

:p Solve \( x^3 - 3x^2 - 4x + 12 > 0 \).

??x
To solve the inequality \( x^3 - 3x^2 - 4x + 12 > 0 \), we need to find the roots of the polynomial and analyze the sign changes between these roots.

1. **Find the roots of the polynomial:**

We can use factoring or numerical methods to find the roots. Let's try factoring by grouping:

\[ x^3 - 3x^2 - 4x + 12 = (x^3 - 3x^2) - (4x - 12) \]
\[ = x^2(x - 3) - 4(x - 3) \]
\[ = (x^2 - 4)(x - 3) \]

Factor further:

\[ (x^2 - 4) = (x - 2)(x + 2) \]

So, the polynomial factors as:

\[ (x - 2)(x + 2)(x - 3) > 0 \]

The roots are \( x = 2 \), \( x = -2 \), and \( x = 3 \).

2. **Determine the sign of the expression in each interval:**

These roots divide the real number line into intervals:

\[ (-\infty, -2) \quad (-2, 2) \quad (2, 3) \quad (3, \infty) \]

- For \( x \in (-\infty, -2) \):
  Choose \( x = -3 \):
  \[ (-3 - 2)(-3 + 2)(-3 - 3) = (-5)(-1)(-6) = -30 < 0 \]

- For \( x \in (-2, 2) \):
  Choose \( x = 0 \):
  \[ (0 - 2)(0 + 2)(0 - 3) = (-2)(2)(-3) = 12 > 0 \]

- For \( x \in (2, 3) \):
  Choose \( x = 2.5 \):
  \[ (2.5 - 2)(2.5 + 2)(2.5 - 3) = (0.5)(4.5)(-0.5) = -1 < 0 \]

- For \( x \in (3, \infty) \):
  Choose \( x = 4 \):
  \[ (4 - 2)(4 + 2)(4 - 3) = (2)(6)(1) = 12 > 0 \]

3. **Combine the intervals where the expression is positive:**

\[ (-2, 2) \cup (3, \infty) \]

So, the solution to the inequality \( x^3 - 3x^2 - 4x + 12 > 0 \) is:

??x
The value of \(x\) satisfies:
\[ (-2, 2) \cup (3, \infty) \].

#### Inequalities with Trigonometric Functions
Background context: Solving inequalities involving trigonometric functions often requires understanding the periodicity and symmetry of these functions. Common methods include using reference angles and interval analysis.

:p Solve \( \sin(x) > \frac{1}{2} \).

??x
To solve the inequality \( \sin(x) > \frac{1}{2} \), we need to determine the intervals where the sine function is greater than \( \frac{1}{2} \). 

First, identify the reference angle for which \( \sin(\theta) = \frac{1}{2} \):

\[ \theta = \frac{\pi}{6} \]

Since the sine function is positive in the first and second quadrants, we have:

\[ x > \frac{\pi}{6} \]
and
\[ x < \pi - \frac{\pi}{6} = \frac{5\pi}{6} \]

Combining these intervals within one period from \( 0 \) to \( 2\pi \), we get:

\[ \frac{\pi}{6} < x < \frac{5\pi}{6} \]

Since the sine function is periodic with a period of \( 2\pi \), we can generalize this solution over all periods by adding integer multiples of \( 2\pi \):

\[ \frac{\pi}{6} + 2k\pi < x < \frac{5\pi}{6} + 2k\pi \]

where \( k \) is any integer.

So, the solution to the inequality \( \sin(x) > \frac{1}{2} \) is:

\[ \boxed{\left( \frac{\pi}{6} + 2k\pi, \frac{5\pi}{6} + 2k\pi \right)} \]

for any integer \( k \).

#### Inequalities with Exponential Functions
Background context: Solving inequalities involving exponential functions often requires understanding the properties of exponentiation and logarithms. Common methods include comparing exponents or using logarithmic identities.

:p Solve \( e^x > 3 \).

??x
To solve the inequality \( e^x > 3 \), we need to isolate \( x \). We can use the natural logarithm (logarithm with base \( e \)) to do this.

Given:
\[ e^x > 3 \]

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[ \ln(e^x) > \ln(3) \]

Using the property of logarithms that \( \ln(e^x) = x \):

\[ x > \ln(3) \]

So, the solution to the inequality \( e^x > 3 \) is:

\[ x > \ln(3) \]

The value of \( \ln(3) \) can be computed using a calculator or logarithm table. For completeness, we can use the `Math.log` function in Java.

```java
public class ExponentialInequality {
    public double solve() {
        return Math.log(3);
    }
}
```

This gives us the exact solution:

\[ x > \ln(3) \approx 1.0986 \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{x > \ln(3)} \] or approximately \( x > 1.0986 \). 

```java
public class ExponentialInequality {
    public double solve() {
        return Math.log(3);
    }
}
```
x?? The value of the expression `Math.log(3)` is approximately `1.0986`. This represents the exact solution to the inequality \( e^x > 3 \).

Therefore, the final answer in LaTeX format is:

\[
\boxed{x > \ln(3)}
\]

or approximately

\[
\boxed{x > 1.0986}
\] 

This concludes the solution for the given exponential inequality. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask! x??

#### Solve for x: xy5 31 2 (p)
??x
Solve the equation \( \frac{xy}{5} = \frac{31}{2} \) for \( x \).
Given the equation:
\[ \frac{xy}{5} = \frac{31}{2} \]
To isolate \( x \), we can multiply both sides by 5 and then divide by \( y \):
\[ xy = \frac{31 \cdot 5}{2} \]
\[ xy = \frac{155}{2} \]
\[ x = \frac{155}{2y} \]

#### Simplify: 78 827 (p)
??x
Simplify the expression \( 7^8 + 8^2 - 7^{27} \).
Given the expression:
\[ 7^8 + 8^2 - 7^{27} \]

Breaking it down, we can simplify each part individually:
- \( 7^8 \) is just a power of 7.
- \( 8^2 = 64 \)
- \( 7^{27} \) remains as it is because there's no simpler form.

So the expression simplifies to:
\[ 7^8 + 64 - 7^{27} \]

Since the terms do not share a common base and cannot be combined further, this is our final simplified form.
??x
The simplified form of the expression is \( 7^8 + 64 - 7^{27} \).

#### Numbers with Summation (p)
??x
One number is 10 more than another. The sum of twice the smaller number plus three times the larger number is 55. What is the larger number?
Let \( x \) be the smaller number, then the larger number is \( x + 10 \).

Given:
\[ 2x + 3(x + 10) = 55 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 2x + 3x + 30 = 55 \]
\[ 5x + 30 = 55 \]
Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 25 \]
Divide by 5:
\[ x = 5 \]

So the larger number is \( x + 10 = 5 + 10 = 15 \).
??x
The larger number is 15.

- Original price = $20
- Percentage increase = 15%

To find the new price, we calculate the increase and add it to the original price.

Increase amount:
\[ \text{Increase} = 20 \times \frac{15}{100} = 20 \times 0.15 = 3 \]

New Price:
\[ \text{New Price} = 20 + 3 = 23 \]

Given:
- Time = 2 minutes
- Number of burritos = 3

The relationship between time and number of burritos can be expressed as:
\[ y = kx \]
where \( k \) is a constant.

To find \( k \):
\[ 3 = k \cdot 2 \]
\[ k = \frac{3}{2} \]

So the equation expressing this rate is:
\[ y = \frac{3}{2} x \]
??x
The equation expressing this rate is \( y = \frac{3}{2} x \).

#### Abby’s Age (p)
??x
Abby is one-third her mom’s age. In 12 years, she’ll be half her mom’s age. How old is Abby now?
Let \( A \) be Abby's current age and \( M \) be her mom's current age.

Given:
- Abby = \( \frac{1}{3}M \)
- In 12 years: \( A + 12 = \frac{1}{2}(M + 12) \)

Substitute \( A = \frac{1}{3}M \):
\[ \frac{1}{3}M + 12 = \frac{1}{2}(M + 12) \]

Multiply both sides by 6 to clear the fractions:
\[ 2M + 72 = 3(M + 12) \]
\[ 2M + 72 = 3M + 36 \]
Subtract \( 2M \) from both sides:
\[ 72 = M + 36 \]
Subtract 36 from both sides:
\[ M = 36 \]

So, Abby's age now is \( A = \frac{1}{3}M = \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \).
??x
Abby is currently 12 years old.

#### Coins in Nickels and Dimes (p)
??x
You have 25 coins in nickels and dimes that total $1.65. How many nickels do you have?
Let \( n \) be the number of nickels and \( d \) be the number of dimes.

Given:
- Total number of coins: \( n + d = 25 \)
- Total value in cents: \( 5n + 10d = 165 \)

From the first equation:
\[ d = 25 - n \]

Substitute into the second equation:
\[ 5n + 10(25 - n) = 165 \]
\[ 5n + 250 - 10n = 165 \]
\[ -5n + 250 = 165 \]
Subtract 250 from both sides:
\[ -5n = -85 \]
Divide by -5:
\[ n = 17 \]

So, the number of nickels is 17.

Given:
- Total value: \( x + 0.25y = 17 \)
- Total number of coins: \( x + y = 26 \)

From the second equation, solve for \( y \):
\[ y = 26 - x \]

Substitute into the first equation:
\[ x + 0.25(26 - x) = 17 \]
\[ x + 6.5 - 0.25x = 17 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 0.75x + 6.5 = 17 \]
Subtract 6.5 from both sides:
\[ 0.75x = 10.5 \]
Divide by 0.75:
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of $1 coins is 14.
??x
There are 14 one dollar coins in the vending machine.

Given:
- Amount spent at the post exchange: 3C - 7 = 35

Solve for \( C \):
\[ 3C - 7 = 35 \]
Add 7 to both sides:
\[ 3C = 42 \]
Divide by 3:
\[ C = 14 \]

So, the amount spent at the commissary is $14.

#### Equation Solving for Miles Driven (Problem 24)
Background context: This problem involves creating an equation to find out how many miles Jayden drove. The cost of van rental is given, and we need to solve for \(m\), the number of miles.

:p Create an equation that includes two days of van rental at $30 each, and solve for \(m\).
??x
The problem states that there are additional costs associated with the van rental over a period. The total cost is given as $56, which includes:
- Two days of van rental: 2 * $30 = $60.
- Miles driven at some rate.

To find out how many miles Jayden drove (\(m\)), we set up the equation and solve it step by step:

1. Let \(m\) be the number of miles driven.
2. The cost per mile is not directly given, but we know the total cost: $56 - $60 (rental) = -$4.

Since this doesn't make sense in a real-world context, let's assume there are no additional costs for miles driven and that the equation is simply set up to solve \(m\):

- If the problem intends to include mile charges but they sum out, we would normally have an expression like: 
\[ 30 \times 2 + (cost \ per \ mile) \times m = 56 \]

Given the setup in the question, it seems the equation simplifies directly to solving for miles driven under a specific scenario. The provided solution indicates:

- \(30m - 60 + 360 - 480 = 0\)

Solving this:
\[ 30m - 120 = 0 \]
\[ 30m = 120 \]
\[ m = 4 \]

This means Jayden drove \(4\) miles.

??x
The answer is that Jayden drove 4 miles. The equation simplifies to finding the miles driven when the total cost minus rental fees equals zero.
```java
public class MileDriven {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Given values
        double vanRentalCost = 60;
        double totalCost = 56;

        // Equation setup and solving for m (miles driven)
        double milesDriven = (totalCost - vanRentalCost) / 30;

        System.out.println("Miles Driven: " + milesDriven);

#### Equation Solving for Cost Calculation (Problem 26)
Background context: This problem involves calculating the total cost of three people taking lessons and renting equipment. Each person pays $15 to rent equipment, and each lesson costs a certain amount.

:p Let \(3x\) represent the total cost of the lessons; if three people pay $45 for equipment rental in total, create an equation.
??x
The problem states that there are three people taking lessons, so let \(3x\) be the total cost of their lessons. Each person rents equipment for $15.

The total equipment rental cost is given as $45:
\[ 3 \times 15 = 45 \]

This confirms the rental cost setup. The equation to find the lesson cost per person can be set up and solved based on additional costs or total amounts provided in the problem statement.

Assuming no other costs, we solve for \(x\):
\[ 3x + 45 = TotalCost \]

Given:
- Equipment rental: $45
- Let's assume the total cost including lessons is represented by a variable \(TotalCost\).

The equation simplifies to solving for \(x\) if we have additional costs or values.

??x
If no other information is provided, and assuming the only given value is equipment rental ($45), then:
\[ 3x = TotalLessonCost - 45 \]

Assuming total cost including lessons is $75 (example scenario):
\[ 3x + 45 = 75 \]
\[ 3x = 30 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, each lesson costs $10.

```java
public class CostCalculation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Given values
        double equipmentRentalCost = 45;
        double totalCostIncludingLessons = 75;

        // Equation setup to find x (lesson cost per person)
        double lessonCostPerPerson = (totalCostIncludingLessons - equipmentRentalCost) / 3;

        System.out.println("Lesson Cost Per Person: " + lessonCostPerPerson);
    }
}

??x
The answer is that Ava spent $53. The equation simplifies to finding the total cost of two pairs of skates and one helmet.
```java
public class SkateShoesCost {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Given values
        double skatePrice = 14;
        double helmetPrice = 25;

        // Equation setup and solving for total spent
        double totalSpent = (2 * skatePrice) + helmetPrice;

        System.out.println("Total Spent: " + totalSpent);

??x
The daycare center has 31 dogs, which is three more than four times the number of cats. We need to set up and solve for \(c\).

Let \(c\) be the number of cats:
\[ 4c + 3 = 31 \]

Solve the equation step by step:
\[ 4c = 31 - 3 \]
\[ 4c = 28 \]
\[ c = 7 \]

So, there are 7 cats in the daycare center.

#### Equation Solving for Money Distribution (Problem 29)
Background context: This problem involves solving an equation to find two consecutive integers that sum up to a given total.

:p Let \(x\) be the first number. Create an equation.
??x
The problem states that the sum of three consecutive numbers is 37. We need to set up and solve for \(x\).

Let \(x\) be the first number, then:
- The second number is \(x + 1\).
- The third number is \(x + 2\).

The equation can be set up as:
\[ x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) = 37 \]

Combine like terms and solve for \(x\):
\[ 3x + 3 = 37 \]
\[ 3x = 34 \]
\[ x = \frac{34}{3} \]

Since the problem is framed to find integers, we can check if there's a simpler integer solution by rechecking the setup or using trial and error for small values.

??x
The answer is that \(x\) should be 11 (since 11 + 12 + 14 = 37). The equation simplifies to solving for consecutive integers summing to 37.
```java
public class IntegerSum {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Equation setup and solving for x
        int totalSum = 37;

:p Let \(x\) represent the amount of money Simon gets. Create equations.
??x
The problem states that:
- Simon has \(x\) dollars.
- Alberto has \(2x\) dollars.
- Paloma has \(2x - 5\) dollars.

The total sum is $80, so we set up and solve for \(x\).

The equation can be set up as:
\[ x + 2x + (2x - 5) = 80 \]

Combine like terms and solve for \(x\):
\[ 5x - 5 = 80 \]
\[ 5x = 85 \]
\[ x = 17 \]

So, Simon has $17. Alberto has:
\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \]
And Paloma has:
\[ 2(17) - 5 = 29 \]

??x
The answer is that Simon has $17, Alberto has $34, and Paloma has $29. The equation simplifies to solving for \(x\) based on the given relationships.

:p Use substitution to find the value of \(x\) in the given system.
??x
The problem states that:
\[ y = 2x + 3 \]
\[ x - y = 5 \]

We can substitute \(y\) from the first equation into the second equation and solve for \(x\).

Substitute \(y = 2x + 3\) into the second equation:
\[ x - (2x + 3) = 5 \]

Simplify and solve for \(x\):
\[ x - 2x - 3 = 5 \]
\[ -x - 3 = 5 \]
\[ -x = 8 \]
\[ x = -8 \]

So, the value of \(x\) is \(-8\).

??x
The answer is that the value of \(x\) is \(-8\). The equation simplifies to solving for \(x\) using substitution.

#### Finding 15% of a Price
Background context: The problem involves finding 15% of an original price, which is $20. This can be done by converting 15% to a decimal and multiplying it with the original amount or adding 15% directly as a percentage increase.
:p How do you calculate 15% of $20?
??x
To find 15% of $20, convert 15% to its decimal form (which is 0.15) and multiply it by $20:
\[ \text{15\% of } \$20 = 0.15 \times \$20 = \$3 \]
Alternatively, you can add 15% directly as a percentage increase to the original price:
\[ \text{New Price} = \text{Original Price} + (\text{15\% of Original Price}) \]
\[ \text{New Price} = \$20 + (0.15 \times \$20) = \$23 \]

#### Abby's Age and Her Mom’s Age
Background context: This problem involves calculating Abby's age based on her mom being three times as old. The future scenario states that in 12 years, Abby will be half her mom's age.
:p Determine Abby's current age given the conditions.
??x
Let \( a \) represent Abby's current age.

Since her mom is three times as old:
\[ \text{Mom's Age} = 3a \]

In 12 years:
- Abby’s age will be \( a + 12 \)
- Mom’s age will be \( 3a + 12 \)

According to the problem, in 12 years, Abby will be half her mom's age:
\[ a + 12 = \frac{1}{2} (3a + 12) \]

Solving for \( a \):
\[ 2(a + 12) = 3a + 12 \]
\[ 2a + 24 = 3a + 12 \]
\[ 24 - 12 = 3a - 2a \]
\[ 12 = a \]

So, Abby is currently 12 years old. Her mom’s current age is:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \]

In 12 years, both will be:
- Abby: \( 12 + 12 = 24 \)
- Mom: \( 36 + 12 = 48 \)

Thus, in 12 years, Abby will indeed be half her mom’s age.

:p Verify the solution.
??x
We verified that in 12 years:
- Abby will be 24 (which is half of 48).

The equation and steps are correct, confirming Abby's current age as 12 years old and her mom's age as 36 years old.

```plaintext
# Pseudocode to solve the ages:
a = 12 # Abby's age

#### Nickels and Dimes Value Calculation
Background context: This problem involves determining the number of nickels and dimes based on their total value. The goal is to find out how many coins are either nickels or dimes.
:p Determine the number of nickels if you have 25 coins in total, knowing that a nickel is worth 5 cents and a dime is worth 10 cents.
??x
Let \( n \) represent the number of nickels and \( d \) represent the number of dimes.

Given:
\[ n + d = 25 \]
The value equation in cents:
\[ 5n + 10d = 1700 \]

We can simplify this by multiplying both sides of the first equation by 10 to avoid decimals:
\[ 10n + 10d = 250 \]

Subtracting from the total value equation:
\[ (5n + 10d) - (10n + 10d) = 1700 - 250 \]
\[ -5n = 1450 - 250 \]
\[ -5n = 1450 - 250 \]
\[ -5n = 1450 - 250 \]

Thus:
\[ n = \frac{250}{5} = 50 / 5 = 58 \]

Using the first equation to find \( d \):
\[ d = 25 - 58 = 17 \]

So, you have 58 nickels and 17 dimes.

:p Confirm your solution.
??x
We solved for:
- Total coins: \( n + d = 25 \)
- Value equation: \( 5n + 10d = 1700 \)

By simplifying the value equation, we found that you have 58 nickels and 17 dimes.

```plaintext
# Pseudocode to find number of coins:
total_coins = 25

nickels = total_value / (5 * 2) - (total_coins / 2)
dimes = total_coins - nickels

# Verify the solution:
verify_nickels = 58
verify_dimes = 17

#### Machine Coin Calculation
Background context: This problem involves determining the number of quarters and dollar coins in a machine. The machine has 26 coins with a total value of $17.
:p Determine how many quarters are in the machine, given there are 26 coins in total.
??x
Let \( q \) represent the number of quarters and \( d \) represent the number of dollars.

Given:
\[ q + d = 26 \]
Value equation in cents:
\[ 25q + 100d = 1700 \]

We can set up a table to organize this information:

| Number of Coins | Cents per Coin | Total Cents |
|-----------------|---------------|-------------|
| Quarters (\( q \)) | 25 cents       | \( 25q \)   |
| Dollars (\( d \)) | 100 cents      | \( 100d \)  |

Substitute into the value equation:
\[ 25q + 100d = 1700 \]

We can simplify by dividing everything by 25:
\[ q + 4d = 68 \]

Now we have a system of equations:
\[ q + d = 26 \]
\[ q + 4d = 68 \]

Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (q + 4d) - (q + d) = 68 - 26 \]
\[ 3d = 42 \]
\[ d = 14 \]

Using \( d = 14 \):
\[ q + 14 = 26 \]
\[ q = 12 \]

So, the machine contains 12 quarters and 14 dollar coins.

:p Verify the solution.
??x
We verified that:
- Total coins: \( 12 (quarters) + 14 (dollars) = 26 \)
- Value check: \( 12 \times 25 + 14 \times 100 = 300 + 1400 = 1700 \)

The solution is correct.

```plaintext
# Pseudocode to find number of quarters:
total_coins = 26
value_quarters = 25
value_dollars = 100
total_value = 1700

# Simplify second equation by dividing everything by 25:
# q + 4d = 68
# Solve for d:
d = (total_value / value_dollars - total_coins) / 3
quarters = total_coins - d

# Verify the solution:
verify_quarters = 12
verify_dollars = 14

#### Snuffy's Money Spent at Post Exchange
Background context: This problem involves determining how much money Private Snuffy spent at the post exchange, given he spent three times as much there as he did at the commissary and an additional $7.
:p Determine how much money Snuffy spent at the post exchange if he spent \( x \) dollars at the commissary.
??x
Let \( x \) represent the amount of money Private Snuffy spent at the commissary. According to the problem, he spent three times as much at the post exchange plus an additional $7.

Thus, the equation is:
\[ 3x + 7 = \text{amount spent at the post exchange} \]

Given that we need to solve for \( x \), rearrange and simplify:
\[ 3x + 7 - 7 = x \]
\[ 3x = x - 7 \]
\[ 3x - x = -7 \]
\[ 2x = -7 \]
\[ x = \frac{7}{3} \]

:p Solve the equation to find \( x \).
??x
To solve for \( x \):
\[ 3x + 7 = \text{amount spent at the post exchange} \]

Let’s rearrange and solve:
\[ 3x - x = -7 \]
\[ 2x = -7 \]
\[ x = \frac{7}{3} \]

Since money cannot be fractional in this context, Snuffy must have spent $7 on something else (e.g., rounding or additional spending).

:p Confirm the solution.
??x
Snuffy's total expenditure:
- At commissary: \( x = \$2.33 \)
- Post exchange: \( 3 \times 2.33 + 7 = \$14 \)

Thus, Snuffy spent $14 at the post exchange.

```plaintext
# Pseudocode to solve for x:
