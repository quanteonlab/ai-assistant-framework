:p How is the AFQT score calculated, and what does it measure?
??x
The AFQT score is a composite of four subtests: Arithmetic Reasoning (AR), Mathematics Knowledge (MK), Paragraph Comprehension (PC), and Verbal Expression (VE). The VE subtest is derived from Word Knowledge (WK) and Paragraph Comprehension (PC).

The formula to calculate the AFQT score is:

$$\text{AFQT} = 2 \times (\text{AR}) + (\text{MK}) + (\text{PC}) + \left(0.6 \times (\text{VE})\right)$$

This score measures your ability to be trained for military service and determines eligibility for various jobs.
