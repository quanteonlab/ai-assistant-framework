#### Plant Reproduction: Angiosperms and Gymnosperms

Background context explaining the difference between angiosperms and gymnosperms. Angiosperms produce flowers that contain stigma (which produces pollen) and carpels (which catch pollen), while gymnosperms produce seeds directly on cone scales.

:p What are angiosperms known for in their reproduction process?
??x
Angiosperms are known for producing flowers, which contain the stigma (that produces pollen) and carpels (that catch pollen). This process often involves pollination by insects, birds, or wind.

#### Plant Reproduction: Bryophytes and Ferns

Background context explaining bryophytes and ferns. These are considered primitive plants that reproduce through spores rather than seeds.

:p How do bryophytes and ferns reproduce?
??x
Bryophytes and ferns reproduce through spores, which contain both male and female reproductive organs. Fertilization occurs before the plant releases a spore.

#### Cell Structure: Common Features

Background context explaining that nearly all cells share certain common features such as a nucleus, cytoplasm, cell membrane, and ribosomes.

:p What are the four things most cells have in common?
??x
Most cells have a nucleus (controlling cellular activity), cytoplasm (a gel-like substance containing chemicals for life processes), cell membrane (protecting the nucleus and cytoplasm), and ribosomes (manufacturing proteins).
