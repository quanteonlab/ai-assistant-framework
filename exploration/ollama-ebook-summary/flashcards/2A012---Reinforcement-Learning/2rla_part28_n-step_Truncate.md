#### Off-line λ-return Algorithm Performance

:p How did TD(λ) perform compared to the off-line λ-return algorithm?

??x
TD(λ) performed virtually identically at low (less than optimal) λ values, but was worse at high λ values. This is evident from Figure 12.6 which shows the RMS error over the first 10 episodes.

For example, in terms of performance metrics:
- When λ = 0 and λ = 0.4, both methods performed similarly.
- At higher λ values (e.g., λ = 0.95 to λ = 1), TD(λ) showed worse results compared to the off-line algorithm.

Here is a simplified comparison using pseudocode:

```java
// Pseudocode for comparing two algorithms over episodes
for(int episode = 1; episode <= 10; episode++) {
    // Calculate error for each algorithm
    double tdError = calculateTDError(episode);
    double offLineLambdaError = calculateOffLineLambdaError(episode);

    // Log the errors or plot them
    logErrors(tdError, offLineLambdaError);
}
```

#### TD(λ) Convergence

:p Under what conditions does Linear TD(λ) converge in the on-policy case?

??x
Linear TD(λ) converges in the on-policy case if the step-size parameter is reduced over time according to the usual conditions. These conditions are often represented as:
\[ \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \alpha_k = \infty \]
and
\[ \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \alpha_k^2 < \infty \]

Where \( \alpha_k \) is the step-size parameter at time k.

This ensures that the updates are sufficiently large initially but reduce over time, leading to convergence. Convergence is not necessarily to the minimum-error weight vector; instead, it converges to a nearby vector that depends on λ.

```java
// Pseudocode for updating weights using TD(λ) with decreasing step-size
for(int k = 0; k < T; k++) {
    // Update rule: w_{k+1} = w_k + alpha * (R_{k+1} + lambda * G_{k+1} - w_k^T * s_{k+1}) * s_{k+1}
    double newWeight = weightUpdateRule(currentWeight, reward, nextRewardEstimate, stepSize);
    currentWeight = newWeight;
    
    // Decrease the step-size
    decreaseStepSize(stepSize);
}

// Function to perform weight update using TD(λ)
private double weightUpdateRule(double w, double r, double g, double alpha) {
    return w + alpha * (r + lambda * g - w * stateVector);
}
```

#### Truncated λ-return Methods

:p What is the formula for the truncated λ-return and how does it differ from the regular λ-return?

??x
The truncated λ-return \( G_t^{\lambda, h} \) is defined as:
\[ G_t^{\lambda, h} = (1 - \lambda)^{h-t-1} \sum_{n=1}^{h-t} \lambda^{n-1} G_{t:t+n} + \lambda^{h-t-1} G_{t:h}, \quad 0 \leq t < h \leq T. \]

This formula truncates the λ-return after a horizon \( h \), making it feasible to compute in real-time without waiting for the entire episode.

The key difference is that \( G_t^{\lambda, h} \) uses rewards up to time \( h \) rather than extending all the way to time \( T \). This makes the truncated λ-return more practical and faster to calculate.

```java
// Pseudocode for calculating truncated lambda return
public double calculateTruncatedLambdaReturn(int t, int h, double lambda, List<Double> rewards) {
    double sum = 0;
    for (int n = 1; n <= h - t; n++) {
        double weight = Math.pow(lambda, n - 1);
        sum += weight * rewards.get(t + n - 1);
    }
    return (1 - lambda) * Math.pow(lambda, h - t - 1) * sum;
}
```

x??

#### Example: Approximating λ-return with TD(λ)

:p How can the error term of the off-line λ-return algorithm be expressed as a sum of TD errors?

??x
The error term in the off-line λ-return algorithm can be written as:
\[ \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} (G_t^{\lambda} - w^T s_t) \]

This can be approximated by expressing it as the sum of TD errors for a single fixed weight vector \( w \). Specifically, if we denote the error term in off-line λ-return as:
\[ E_t = G_t^{\lambda} - w^T s_t, \]
and use the recursive relationship obtained from Exercise 12.1 to express each step's contribution as a TD update.

For example, using (6.6) and the recursive relationship of \( G_t^{\lambda} \):
\[ E_t = \sum_{n=0}^{T-t-1} \lambda^n (R_{t+n+1} - w^T s_{t+n+1}) + \lambda^{T-t-1}(G_{t:T} - w^T s_T). \]

The sum of these terms over all t can be shown to match the sum of TD(λ) updates.

```java
// Pseudocode for showing equivalence between off-line lambda return and sum of TD errors
public double calculateOffLineLambdaError(int t, int T, double lambda, List<Double> rewards, List<Double> states, double[] weightVector) {
    double error = 0;
    for (int n = 0; n < T - t - 1; n++) {
        double tdError = rewards.get(t + n) - dotProduct(weightVector, states.get(t + n));
        error += Math.pow(lambda, n) * tdError;
    }
    return error + Math.pow(lambda, T - t - 1) * (calculateLambdaReturn(T, lambda, rewards) - dotProduct(weightVector, states.get(T)));
}
```

#### Sum of TD(λ) Updates

:p If the weight updates over an episode were computed on each step but not actually used to change the weights, what would be the sum of these updates compared to the off-line λ-return algorithm?

??x
If the weight updates over an episode were computed on each step but not actually used to change the weights (i.e., \( w \) remained fixed), then the sum of TD(λ)'s weight updates would be the same as the sum of the off-line λ-return algorithm's updates.

This is because both algorithms compute the same errors at each step, and the accumulation over time would yield identical sums. The key insight here is that the recursive relationship in \( G_t^{\lambda} \) and the TD(λ) update rule are essentially equivalent when considering just the error terms.

For example:
```java
// Pseudocode for summing weight updates without applying them
public double calculateSumTDUpdates(List<Double> rewards, List<Double> states, double[] weightVector, double lambda) {
    double sum = 0;
    for (int t = 0; t < rewards.size(); t++) {
        double tdError = rewards.get(t) - dotProduct(weightVector, states.get(t));
        sum += Math.pow(lambda, t) * tdError;
    }
    return sum;
}
```

#### Online Ө-Return Algorithm Overview
Online Ө-return algorithm is an approach to improve learning efficiency by redoing updates on each time step, using the latest horizon. This method allows for more accurate value function estimation by incorporating recent data into the target values.

:p What is the main idea behind the online Ө-return algorithm?
??x
The main idea of the online Ө-return algorithm is to continuously update weight vectors based on a growing horizon of data, ensuring that each step uses the latest information available. This approach aims to approximate the offline Ө-return algorithm more closely while allowing updates sooner and influencing behavior earlier.
x??

---

#### Truncation Parameter n in Ө-Return
The parameter `n` in truncated Ө-return involves balancing between approximating the offline Ө-return method effectively (by making `n` large) and ensuring timely updates that can influence current behavior (by keeping `n` small).

:p How does choosing the truncation parameter `n` affect the online Ө-return algorithm?
??x
Choosing the truncation parameter `n` affects the balance between accuracy and timeliness. Larger values of `n` make the method closer to the offline Ө-return, but smaller values allow for updates sooner and influence behavior more quickly.

The trade-off is that while larger `n` can lead to better long-term performance by considering more data, it also delays the updates and thus reduces their immediate impact.
x??

---

#### Definition of Truncated Ө-Return
The truncated Ө-return is defined as \( G_{t:h} = (1 - \theta)^{h-t-1} \sum_{n=1}^{h-t} \theta^{n-1}G_{t:t+n} + \theta^{h-t-1} G_{t:h} \).

:p What does the formula for truncated Ө-return represent?
??x
The formula represents a weighted sum of returns over time steps, where `h` is the current horizon and `t` is the initial step. It balances immediate rewards with future predictions by discounting past values and bootstrapping from future estimates.
x??

---

#### Proving Equation (12.10)
Equation (12.10) states that \( G_{t:t+n} = \hat{v}(S_t, w_{t-1}) + \sum_{i=t+1}^{t+n-1} (\gamma^{\alpha_i}) (R_{i+1} + \hat{v}(S_{i+1}, w_i) - \hat{v}(S_t, w_{t-1})) \).

:p How can we prove equation (12.10)?
??x
To prove equation (12.10), we need to show that the `k-step Ө-return` \( G_{t:t+k} \) can be written as a sum of a value estimate and discounted future rewards.

Starting from the definition, the truncated Ө-return is:
\[ G_{t:h} = (1 - \theta)^{h-t-1} \sum_{n=1}^{h-t} \theta^{n-1}G_{t:t+n} + \theta^{h-t-1} G_{t:h}. \]

For the specific case of \( k \)-step return:
\[ G_{t:t+k} = \hat{v}(S_t, w_{t-1}) + \sum_{i=t+1}^{t+k} (\gamma^{\alpha_i}) (R_{i+1} + \hat{v}(S_{i+1}, w_i) - \hat{v}(S_t, w_{t-1})). \]

This equation shows that the return can be decomposed into a value estimate at time `t` and a sum of discounted future rewards, validating the use of TD errors in updating the value function.
x??

#### Concept of Redoing Updates
Redoing updates involves revisiting previous steps to incorporate new data, starting from the initial weights \( w_0 \) every time the horizon is extended.

:p How does redoing updates work in the online Ө-return algorithm?
??x
In the online Ө-return algorithm, updates are redone on each step by extending the horizon. Starting with the initial weights \( w_0 \), as new data becomes available, the targets for updates are recalculated to include this data, leading to more accurate value function estimates.

For example:
- At time `t=1`, update target is \( G_{0:1} = R_1 + \hat{v}(S_1, w_0) - \hat{v}(S_0, w_0) \).
- When data horizon extends to step 2, targets are recalculated using new weights and data.
x??

---

#### Update Target Calculation
The update target for the first time step is \( G_{t:h} = \hat{v}(S_t, w_{t-1}) + \sum_{i=t+1}^{t+h-1} (\gamma^{\alpha_i}) (R_{i+1} + \hat{v}(S_{i+1}, w_i) - \hat{v}(S_t, w_{t-1})) \).

:p How is the update target calculated for each time step in the online Ө-return algorithm?
??x
The update target for each time step \( t \) in the online Ө-return algorithm is calculated by bootstrapping from previous value estimates and incorporating future rewards. Specifically:
\[ G_{t:h} = \hat{v}(S_t, w_{t-1}) + \sum_{i=t+1}^{t+h-1} (\gamma^{\alpha_i}) (R_{i+1} + \hat{v}(S_{i+1}, w_i) - \hat{v}(S_t, w_{t-1})). \]

This target uses the latest weights and data to provide a more accurate estimate of the return.
x??

---

#### Example Update Sequence
An example sequence for updating weight vectors in the online Ө-return algorithm is given as follows:
\[ h=1: \quad w_1^1 = w_1^0 + \alpha (G_{0:1} - \hat{v}(S_0, w_1^0)) r(S_0, w_1^0), \]
\[ h=2: \quad w_2^1 = w_2^0 + \alpha (G_{0:2} - \hat{v}(S_0, w_2^0)) r(S_0, w_2^0), \quad w_2^2 = w_2^1 + \alpha (G_{1:2} - \hat{v}(S_1, w_2^1)) r(S_1, w_2^1). \]

:p How does the online Ө-return algorithm update weight vectors?
??x
The online Ө-return algorithm updates weight vectors by extending the horizon and recalculating targets for each step. For instance:

- At \( h=1 \):
\[ w_1^1 = w_1^0 + \alpha (G_{0:1} - \hat{v}(S_0, w_1^0)) r(S_0, w_1^0). \]

- At \( h=2 \):
\[ w_2^1 = w_2^0 + \alpha (G_{0:2} - \hat{v}(S_0, w_2^0)) r(S_0, w_2^0), \]
\[ w_2^2 = w_2^1 + \alpha (G_{1:2} - \hat{v}(S_1, w_2^1)) r(S_1, w_2^1). \]

This process ensures that each update uses the latest information to provide a more accurate value function estimate.

#### True Online TD(λ) Algorithm

**Background context:** The text discusses the true online TD(λ) algorithm, which is a more efficient implementation of the λ-return algorithm for linear function approximation. This method aims to reduce computational complexity while maintaining performance comparable to the standard forward-view algorithm.

The key difference lies in how weight vectors are handled. Instead of maintaining and updating all previous weight vectors, only the diagonal elements (wt t) are used, significantly reducing memory requirements and computational overhead.

**Relevant formulas:** 
- The update rule for wt+1 is given by:
  \[
  w_{t+1} = w_t + \alpha \lambda^t z_t + \alpha x_t^\top (\lambda^t (z_t - z_{t-1}) x_t)
  \]
  where \( z_t \) and \( z_{t-1} \) are defined as:
  \[
  z_t = \lambda z_{t-1} + \frac{\lambda}{\alpha} x_t^\top (x_t - V^*)
  \]

**C/Java code example:**
```java
public class TrueOnlineTDAlgorithm {
    private double alpha; // Step size
    private double lambda; // Trace decay rate
    
    public void updateWeights(double[] xt, double vt, double vOld) {
        z = lambda * z + (lambda / alpha) * dotProduct(xt, xt) - (lambda / alpha) * dotProduct(xt, V);
        
        w = w + alpha * lambda * t * z * dotProduct(xt, xt) + alpha * x_t * (z - z_prev) * x_t;
    }
    
    private double dotProduct(double[] a, double[] b) {
        // Compute the dot product of two vectors
        return 0; // Placeholder for actual implementation
    }
}
```

:p What is the purpose of the true online TD(λ) algorithm?
??x
The purpose of the true online TD(λ) algorithm is to provide an efficient and compact way of implementing the λ-return algorithm using eligibility traces. It reduces memory requirements by only keeping track of the diagonal weight vectors, thus making it more computationally feasible compared to the conventional forward-view approach.
x??

#### Diagonal Weight Vectors

**Background context:** The text emphasizes that in the true online TD(λ) algorithm, only the diagonal elements (wt t) are essential for computing new weight vectors. These diagonal elements play a crucial role in the n-step returns during updates.

**Relevant formulas:**
- The sequence of weight vectors is organized as a triangle:
  \[
  w_{0}^{0}, w_{1}^{0}, w_{1}^{1}, w_{2}^{0}, w_{2}^{1}, w_{2}^{2}, \ldots, w_{T}^{0}, w_{T}^{1}, \ldots, w_{T}^{T}
  \]
- The diagonal elements \( w_t^t \) are the only ones necessary for efficient computation.

**C/Java code example:**
```java
public class DiagonalWeightVectors {
    private double[][] weightTriangle = new double[episodeLength][episodeLength];
    
    public void setDiagonalWeights(double[] weights) {
        for (int i = 0; i < weights.length; i++) {
            weightTriangle[i][i] = weights[i];
        }
    }
}
```

:p What are the diagonal weight vectors in the true online TD(λ) algorithm?
??x
The diagonal weight vectors \( w_t^t \) in the true online TD(λ) algorithm refer to the sequence of weight vectors along the main diagonal of the triangle. These vectors play a key role in the n-step returns and are used to compute new weight vectors efficiently.
x??

#### Pseudocode for True Online TD(λ)

**Background context:** The text provides pseudocode for implementing the true online TD(λ) algorithm, focusing on reducing computational complexity while maintaining performance.

**Pseudocode:**
```java
// Initialize parameters and variables
w = initializeWeightVector(); // e.g., w=0
z = 0; // Initialize eligibility trace
Vold = 0; // Previous value function

for each episode {
    x = initialFeatureVector();
    
    for each step in the episode {
        chooseActionA(); // Choose action based on policy π
        
        observe(R, x0); // Observe reward and next state feature vector
        V = w .x; // Compute current value estimate
        V0 = w .x0; // Compute value estimate of the next state
        delta = R + lambda * V0 - V;
        
        z = lambda * z + (lambda / alpha) * dotProduct(x, x) - (lambda / alpha) * dotProduct(x, V);
        
        w = w + alpha * (delta + Vold) * z . x + alpha * x . (z - zOld) . x;
        Vold = V0;
        x = x0;
    }
}
```

:p What is the pseudocode for the true online TD(λ) algorithm?
??x
The pseudocode for the true online TD(λ) algorithm involves maintaining a single weight vector and updating it using eligibility traces. It computes the value function estimates and updates the weight vector efficiently, focusing on the diagonal elements of the weight vectors.

```java
// Pseudocode for True Online TD(λ)
w = initializeWeightVector(); // Initialize weight vector to zero or other values
z = 0; // Initialize eligibility trace
Vold = 0; // Previous value function

for each episode {
    x = initialFeatureVector();
    
    for each step in the episode {
        chooseActionA(); // Choose action based on policy π
        
        observe(R, x0); // Observe reward and next state feature vector
        V = w .x; // Compute current value estimate
        V0 = w .x0; // Compute value estimate of the next state
        delta = R + lambda * V0 - V;
        
        z = lambda * z + (lambda / alpha) * dotProduct(x, x) - (lambda / alpha) * dotProduct(x, V);
        
        w = w + alpha * (delta + Vold) * z . x + alpha * x . (z - zOld) . x;
        Vold = V0;
        x = x0;
    }
}
```

#### Update Rule for True Online TD(λ)

**Background context:** The update rule for the true online TD(λ) algorithm is crucial for understanding how weight vectors are updated efficiently. It involves a combination of eligibility traces and value function estimates.

**Relevant formulas:**
- The update rule is given by:
  \[
  w_{t+1} = w_t + \alpha \lambda^t z_t + \alpha x_t^\top (\lambda^t (z_t - z_{t-1}) x_t)
  \]
  where \( z_t \) and \( z_{t-1} \) are defined as:
  \[
  z_t = \lambda z_{t-1} + \frac{\lambda}{\alpha} x_t^\top (x_t - V^*)
  \]

**C/Java code example:**
```java
public class UpdateRule {
    private double alpha; // Step size
    private double lambda; // Trace decay rate
    
    public void updateWeights(double[] xt, double vt, double vOld) {
        z = lambda * z + (lambda / alpha) * dotProduct(xt, xt) - (lambda / alpha) * dotProduct(xt, V);
        
        w = w + alpha * lambda * t * z * dotProduct(xt, xt) + alpha * x_t * (z - z_prev) * x_t;
    }
    
    private double dotProduct(double[] a, double[] b) {
        // Compute the dot product of two vectors
        return 0; // Placeholder for actual implementation
    }
}
```

:p What is the update rule for true online TD(λ)?
??x
The update rule for true online TD(λ) involves updating weight vectors using a combination of eligibility traces and value function estimates. The formula is:
\[
w_{t+1} = w_t + \alpha \lambda^t z_t + \alpha x_t^\top (\lambda^t (z_t - z_{t-1}) x_t)
\]
where \( z_t \) is updated as:
\[
z_t = \lambda z_{t-1} + \frac{\lambda}{\alpha} x_t^\top (x_t - V^*)
\]

This rule ensures that the algorithm efficiently updates weight vectors while maintaining performance close to the full online TD(λ) algorithm.
