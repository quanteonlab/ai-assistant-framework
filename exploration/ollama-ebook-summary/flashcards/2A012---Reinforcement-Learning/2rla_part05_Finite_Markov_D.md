**Starting Chapter:** Finite Markov Decision Processes. The AgentEnvironment Interface

---

#### Agent-Environment Interface
MDPs frame the problem of learning from interaction to achieve a goal. The agent is the decision-maker and interacts with the environment, which includes everything outside the agent.

The interaction sequence can be represented as follows:
- At each discrete time step $t = 0,1,2,...$, the environment provides the agent with its current state $ S_t \in S$.
- Based on this state, the agent selects an action $A_t \in A(s)$.
- The environment then transitions to a new state $S_{t+1} \in S $ and provides the agent with a reward$R_{t+1} \in R$.

This interaction is depicted as:
$$S_0, A_0, R_1, S_1, A_1, R_2, S_2, A_2, R_3,...$$:p What does the agent–environment interaction in a Markov decision process consist of?
??x
The interaction involves discrete time steps where at each step $t $, the environment provides the state $ S_t $ to the agent. The agent then chooses an action $ A_t $ based on this state, and the environment transitions to a new state $ S_{t+1}$and gives the agent a reward $ R_{t+1}$. This process forms a sequence of states, actions, rewards.
```java
// Pseudocode for one time step in MDP interaction
public class Interaction {
    State getS() { /* Environment provides current state */ }
    Action selectA(State s) { /* Agent selects action based on state */ }
    Reward getR(Action a) { /* Environment returns reward for the selected action */ }
    State transitionS() { /* Environment transitions to next state */ }
}
```

#### Finite Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)
Finite MDPs are a classical formalization of sequential decision making where actions influence both immediate and future rewards. In MDPs, we estimate values for each action $q^\ast(s, a)$ in each state $s$, or the value of each state given optimal actions.

:p What is a Finite Markov Decision Process (MDP)?
??x
A Finite Markov Decision Process is a mathematical framework for modeling decision-making problems where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision maker. It involves states, actions, rewards, and transitions between states based on chosen actions.
In an MDP:
- States $S$ represent possible situations or configurations of the environment.
- Actions $A(s)$ represent choices available in each state.
- Rewards $R$ are numerical values that the agent aims to maximize over time.

The value functions and Bellman equations play a crucial role in determining optimal policies. The goal is to find an optimal policy that maximizes expected rewards.
x??

---
#### Returns, Value Functions, and Bellman Equations
In MDPs, returns are defined as cumulative discounted rewards over multiple time steps. The value function $v^\ast(s)$ represents the long-term reward starting from state $ s $, while the action-value function $ q^\ast(s, a)$gives the expected return starting from state $ s$and taking action $ a$.

The Bellman equation for the action-value function is:
$$q^\ast(s, a) = \sum_{s', r} p(s', r | s, a) [r + \gamma v^\ast(s')]$$:p What are returns, value functions, and Bellman equations in MDPs?
??x
Returns in an MDP are the sum of discounted rewards over time. The value function $v^\ast(s)$ is the expected cumulative reward starting from state $ s $. The action-value function $ q^\ast(s, a)$represents the expected return when taking action $ a$in state $ s$.

The Bellman equation for the action-value function combines immediate rewards with discounted future values:
$$q^\ast(s, a) = \sum_{s', r} p(s', r | s, a) [r + \gamma v^\ast(s')]$$where $ p(s', r | s, a)$is the probability of transitioning to state $ s'$and receiving reward $ r$, and $\gamma$ is the discount factor.

This equation ensures that the value of an action in a given state considers both immediate rewards and future rewards.

#### Trade-offs Between Breadth and Mathematical Tractability
MDPs provide a mathematically idealized form for reinforcement learning, allowing precise theoretical statements. However, there's a tension between broad applicability and mathematical tractability.

:p What are the trade-offs in MDPs regarding breadth of applicability and mathematical tractability?
??x
There is a balance to be struck between making an MDP broadly applicable (encompassing many real-world scenarios) and maintaining mathematical tractability, which allows for precise theoretical analysis. While broad applicability ensures that MDPs can model diverse problems, it may introduce complexity, making the models harder to solve mathematically.

Mathematical tractability, on the other hand, simplifies analysis but might limit the scope of real-world scenarios that can be accurately modeled.
x??

#### Markov Decision Process (MDP) Dynamics

Background context: In an MDP, the dynamics are defined by a function $p$, which gives the probability of transitioning to a new state and receiving a reward given the current state and action. This function is crucial because it characterizes how the environment evolves based on the agent's actions.

Relevant formulas:
$$p(s_0, r | s, a) = P_r \{ S_t = s_0, R_t = r | S_{t-1} = s, A_{t-1} = a \}$$

The dynamics function $p $ is defined as an ordinary deterministic function of four arguments: the current state$s $, action$ a $, next state$ s_0 $, and reward$ r$.

:p What does the function $p(s_0, r | s, a)$ represent in an MDP?
??x
The function $p(s_0, r | s, a)$ represents the probability of transitioning to the next state $ s_0 $ and receiving a reward $ r $ given that the current state is $ s $ and the action taken was $a$.

Example:
```java
public double transitionProbability(State s, Action a, State nextState, Reward reward) {
    // This function would return the probability of moving to 'nextState' with 'reward'
    return p(nextState, reward | s, a);
}
```
x??

---

#### Markov Property

Background context: The Markov property states that future states depend only on the current state and action. Formally, this means that given $S_{t-1}$ and $A_{t-1}$, earlier states and actions do not provide additional information about the future.

Relevant formulas:
$$\sum_{s_0 \in S} \sum_{r \in R} p(s_0, r | s, a) = 1$$

This equation ensures that for any given state $s $ and action$a$, all possible transitions sum to one probability.

:p What is the Markov property in an MDP?
??x
The Markov property states that future states depend only on the current state and action. Given $S_{t-1}$ and $A_{t-1}$, earlier states and actions do not provide additional information about the future.

Example:
```java
public boolean hasMarkovProperty(State currentState, Action lastAction) {
    // This method would check if the current state and previous action determine the next state and reward.
    return true; // Assuming the environment is Markovian
}
```
x??

---

#### Transition Probabilities

Background context: Given $p(s_0 | s, a)$, the transition probability from state $ s$to state $ s_0$ given action $ a$, can be computed by summing over all possible rewards.

Relevant formulas:
$$p(s_0 | s, a) = \sum_{r \in R} p(s_0, r | s, a)$$:p How is the transition probability from state $ s $ to state $ s_0 $ given action $ a$ computed?
??x
The transition probability from state $s $ to state$s_0 $ given action$a$ can be computed by summing over all possible rewards:
$$p(s_0 | s, a) = \sum_{r \in R} p(s_0, r | s, a)$$

Example:
```java
public double transitionProbability(State currentState, Action lastAction, State nextState) {
    double probability = 0.0;
    for (Reward reward : possibleRewards) {
        probability += p(nextState, reward | currentState, lastAction);
    }
    return probability;
}
```
x??

---

#### Expected Rewards

Background context: The expected rewards for state-action pairs and state-action-next-state triples can be computed using the dynamics function $p$.

Relevant formulas:
$$r(s, a) = E[R_t | S_{t-1} = s, A_{t-1} = a] = \sum_{s_0 \in S} \sum_{r \in R} r \cdot p(s_0, r | s, a)$$
$$r(s, a, s_0) = E[R_t | S_{t-1} = s, A_{t-1} = a, S_t = s_0] = \sum_{r \in R} r \cdot p(s_0, r | s, a)$$:p How is the expected reward for state-action pairs computed?
??x
The expected reward for state-action pairs can be computed as:
$$r(s, a) = E[R_t | S_{t-1} = s, A_{t-1} = a] = \sum_{s_0 \in S} \sum_{r \in R} r \cdot p(s_0, r | s, a)$$

Example:
```java
public double expectedReward(State currentState, Action lastAction) {
    double expectedReward = 0.0;
    for (State nextState : possibleNextStates) {
        for (Reward reward : possibleRewards) {
            expectedReward += reward * p(nextState, reward | currentState, lastAction);
        }
    }
    return expectedReward;
}
```
x??

---

#### Expected Rewards for State-Action-Next-State Triples

Background context: The expected rewards for state-action-next-state triples can be computed by considering the joint probability of transitioning to $s_0$ and receiving a reward.

Relevant formulas:
$$r(s, a, s_0) = E[R_t | S_{t-1} = s, A_{t-1} = a, S_t = s_0] = \sum_{r \in R} r \cdot p(s_0, r | s, a)$$:p How is the expected reward for state-action-next-state triples computed?
??x
The expected reward for state-action-next-state triples can be computed as:
$$r(s, a, s_0) = E[R_t | S_{t-1} = s, A_{t-1} = a, S_t = s_0] = \sum_{r \in R} r \cdot p(s_0, r | s, a)$$

Example:
```java
public double expectedReward(State currentState, Action lastAction, State nextState) {
    double expectedReward = 0.0;
    for (Reward reward : possibleRewards) {
        expectedReward += reward * p(nextState, reward | currentState, lastAction);
    }
    return expectedReward;
}
```

#### MDP Framework Flexibility and Applications
The MDP framework is abstract and flexible, allowing its application to various types of problems. Time steps need not refer to fixed intervals of real time but can represent successive stages of decision making and acting. Actions can range from low-level controls (e.g., voltages applied to a robot arm) to high-level decisions (e.g., deciding whether or not to have lunch).

:p What is the MDP framework's flexibility in terms of how it handles time steps?
??x
The MDP framework allows for flexible interpretation of "time steps," which do not need to correspond to fixed intervals of real time. Instead, they can symbolize successive stages of decision-making and acting.
x??

---
#### Variety of Actions and States
Actions within the MDP framework are versatile; they can be low-level controls such as motor voltages or high-level decisions like whether to have lunch or go to graduate school. States can take various forms—ranging from direct sensor readings to symbolic descriptions, including memory-based perceptions or subjective states.

:p Can you give an example of a state in the MDP framework?
??x
A state in the MDP framework could be a symbolic description of objects in a room. For instance, an agent might use such a state to represent its belief about where an object is located based on past sensor readings and memory.
x??

---
#### Agent-Environment Boundary
The agent-environment boundary can vary depending on context; for example, the motors and mechanical linkages of a robot or sensory hardware are typically considered part of the environment. Similarly, in a person or animal model, muscles, skeleton, and sensory organs fall within the environmental boundaries.

:p How does the MDP framework define the agent's control over its environment?
??x
In the MDP framework, anything that cannot be arbitrarily changed by the agent is considered part of its environment. This means controls like motor voltages or physical actions are external to the agent, while knowledge and perceptions can still belong to the agent.
x??

---
#### Rewards in the MDP Framework
Rewards are computed within an agent's physical body but are treated as external elements when modeling tasks using the MDP framework. Even if the agent knows everything about its environment, rewards remain outside its control.

:p What does the MDP framework consider external to the agent?
??x
In the MDP framework, rewards are considered external to the agent despite knowing their computation based on actions and states. This is because the reward function defines the task and must be beyond arbitrary change by the agent.
x??

---
#### Agent-Environment Boundary in Complex Systems
For complex systems like robots, multiple agents might operate at different levels, with higher-level decisions forming part of lower-level decision-making processes.

:p How does the MDP framework handle multi-agent scenarios in a single system?
??x
In the MDP framework, multiple agents can operate within a complex system. Higher-level agents make decisions that form states for lower-level agents. This hierarchical structure allows for more nuanced modeling of interactions between different control levels.
x??

---
#### Flexibility in Defining Control Limits
The agent-environment boundary represents absolute control limits rather than knowledge limits and can vary depending on the specific task or decision-making process.

:p How is the agent-environment boundary determined?
??x
The agent-environment boundary is determined by selecting particular states, actions, and rewards for a specific task. This selection identifies the task of interest and defines what the agent controls versus what is external to it.
x??

#### MDP Framework Overview
The Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework is a foundational concept used for goal-directed learning from interaction. It abstracts any problem of learning goal-directed behavior into three signals: actions, states, and rewards. The objective here is to understand how these three components interact to achieve the desired goal.
:p What are the three key signals in the MDP framework?
??x
The three key signals in the MDP framework are:
- Actions (choices made by the agent)
- States (basis on which choices are made)
- Rewards (agent’s goals defined)

These signals help define how an agent interacts with its environment and learns optimal behaviors.
x??

---
#### Bioreactor Example
In a bioreactor application, reinforcement learning is used to control temperatures and stirring rates. The actions involve setting target temperatures and stirring rates, which are then passed to lower-level control systems. The states include thermocouple readings and symbolic inputs representing the ingredients in the vat, and the rewards measure the rate of useful chemical production.
:p What are the key components of the bioreactor reinforcement learning example?
??x
The key components of the bioreactor reinforcement learning example are:
- **Actions**: Target temperatures and stirring rates set to control heating elements and motors.
- **States**: Thermocouple readings, symbolic inputs representing ingredients in the vat, and target chemical.
- **Rewards**: Measures the rate at which useful chemicals are produced.

These components help define the interaction between the agent (controller) and the environment (bioreactor).
x??

---
#### Pick-and-Place Robot Example
For a pick-and-place robot task using reinforcement learning, actions involve controlling motor voltages directly to achieve smooth movements. States include joint angles and velocities. Rewards are +1 for successful picking and placing of objects, with additional small negative rewards for jerkiness in motion.
:p What are the key components of the pick-and-place robot reinforcement learning example?
??x
The key components of the pick-and-place robot reinforcement learning example are:
- **Actions**: Voltages applied to each motor at each joint to control movement.
- **States**: Latest readings of joint angles and velocities.
- **Rewards**: +1 for successfully picking up an object and placing it, -0.1 (as a penalty) for jerkiness in motion.

These components help define the interaction between the agent (controller) and the environment (robot).
x??

---
#### State and Action Representation
In reinforcement learning tasks, states and actions often have structured representations. States can include multiple sensor readings or symbolic inputs, while actions typically involve vector targets like temperatures and stirring rates for a bioreactor.
:p How are states and actions represented in reinforcement learning tasks?
??x
In reinforcement learning tasks:
- **States** are usually composed of lists or vectors containing sensor readings or symbolic inputs. For example, thermocouple readings and ingredient status in a bioreactor.
- **Actions** often consist of vector targets, such as target temperatures and stirring rates for controlling heating elements.

These structured representations help the agent understand its environment and make informed decisions.
x??

#### Recycling Robot MDP Example
Background context: This example describes a mobile robot tasked with collecting empty soda cans in an office environment. The system is modeled as a finite Markov Decision Process (MDP), where states, actions, and rewards are defined to simulate the robot's decision-making process.
:p What are the key components of the Recycling Robot MDP?
??x
The key components include:
- **States**: High battery charge level (`high`), Low battery charge level (`low`)
- **Actions**:
  - `search`: Actively search for cans
  - `wait`: Remain stationary and wait for someone to bring a can
  - `recharge`: Head back to the home base to recharge (only applicable in low state)
- **Rewards**: 
  - Positive reward when collecting a can (`+1`)
  - Negative reward if battery runs down (`-3`)

The robot's decision-making is based on its current charge level. The transition probabilities and expected rewards are defined as follows:
```markdown
sa s0 p(s0|s, a) r(s, a, s0)
high search high ↵ rsearch
high search low 1 – ↵ rsearch
low search high 1 – 3 – rsearch
low search low 3 –  rsearch
high wait high 1 rwait
high wait low 0 - 
low wait high 0 - 
low wait low 1 rwait
low recharge high 1 0 
low recharge low 0 - 
```

#### Different Levels of Actions in Driving

Background context: The example discusses the different levels at which actions can be defined for a driving task, from the most granular (muscle twitches) to the highest level (choices about where to drive). This highlights the flexibility in defining an agent's action space.
:p At what levels could actions be defined for a driving task?
??x
Actions could be defined at several levels:
- **Low-level**: Muscle twitches controlling limbs, directly manipulating the steering wheel and pedals.
- **Mid-level**: Tire torques or forces applied to the road surface.
- **High-level**: Decisions about where to drive, such as choosing a route or destination.

The appropriate level depends on the problem's complexity and the desired abstraction. For example, reinforcement learning might benefit from higher-level actions that align more closely with human driving decisions.
x??

---

#### MDP Adequacy for All Goal-Directed Learning Tasks

Background context: The question explores whether the Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework can represent all goal-directed learning tasks effectively and identifies potential exceptions.
:p Is the MDP framework adequate to represent all goal-directed learning tasks?
??x
The MDP framework is flexible but not universally applicable. It works well for tasks with clear states, actions, and rewards where the future only depends on the current state (Markov property). However, it may struggle with:
- Tasks involving complex, non-Markovian dependencies.
- Tasks requiring long-term planning or strategic thinking beyond simple immediate rewards.

For instance, tasks that involve deep hierarchical planning, complex cognitive strategies, or long-term goals might need more sophisticated models like hierarchical MDPs, Partially Observable MDPs (POMDPs), or neural-based reinforcement learning frameworks.
x??

---

#### Example Tasks in MDP Framework

Background context: The exercise asks to devise three example tasks that fit into the MDP framework, with each task being as different from the others as possible. This stretches the limits of the MDP by creating diverse scenarios.
:p Devise an example task for the MDP framework that is vastly different from a simple robot recycling scenario?
??x
Example Task: A Chess Agent

- **States**: Each state represents a unique board configuration, where each piece's position and type are encoded.
- **Actions**: Actions correspond to legal moves of any piece on the board.
- **Rewards**: Rewards are +1 for winning the game, -1 for losing, and 0 otherwise. The goal is to maximize cumulative rewards over time.

This task differs significantly from the recycling robot example in terms of complexity, state space size, action space, and reward structure. It involves deep strategic thinking and long-term planning.
x??

---

#### Transition Graph Representation of MDPs
The dynamics of a finite Markov Decision Process (MDP) can be summarized by a transition graph. This graph consists of two types of nodes: state nodes and action nodes. Each state has a corresponding state node, which is represented as a large open circle labeled with the name of the state. Action nodes are smaller solid circles connected to their respective state nodes via lines. Taking an action from a state moves you along this line to an action node.

From each action node, arrows represent possible transitions to other states. Each arrow corresponds to a tuple (s, s0, a) where $s $ is the current state,$s_0 $ is the next state, and$a $ is the action taken. The probability of transitioning from state $ s $ to state $ s_0 $ when taking action $ a $ is denoted by $ p(s_0 | s, a)$, and the expected reward for this transition is denoted by $ r(s, a, s_0)$. 

:p What is a transition graph in MDPs?
??x
A transition graph in MDPs visually represents the dynamics of an MDP. It includes state nodes (large open circles labeled with states) and action nodes (small solid circles connected to state nodes via lines), where transitions are represented by arrows labeled with transition probabilities and expected rewards.
x??

---

#### Reward Hypothesis
In reinforcement learning, the agent's goal is defined through a reward signal passed from the environment. At each time step $t $, the reward $ R_t $ is a simple number in the real number space $ R$. The objective for the agent is to maximize the total cumulative reward over time.

Formally, this can be expressed as maximizing the expected value of the sum of rewards over episodes:
$$E\left[ \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} R_t \right]$$

For example, when programming a robot to walk, researchers might provide a reward on each step proportional to the distance traveled forward. Similarly, for escaping a maze, the agent receives a reward of 1 for every time step until escape.

:p What is the reward hypothesis?
??x
The reward hypothesis posits that all goals and purposes can be well thought of as maximizing the expected value of the cumulative sum of a scalar signal (reward). This formalization allows us to use reward signals to define an agent's objectives.
x??

---

#### Types of Rewards in Reinforcement Learning
Rewards are used to shape the behavior of agents in reinforcement learning. For instance, in robot training scenarios:
- Walking: Reward based on forward motion.
- Maze Escape: Continuous positive reward for time steps before escape.
- Recycling Soda Cans: Zero most of the time; +1 per can collected with potential negative rewards for collisions or insults.

:p How are rewards used to train robots?
??x
Rewards in reinforcement learning guide an agent's behavior by providing feedback on actions. By setting up appropriate reward structures, we can influence the agent to perform tasks that align with our goals, such as walking forward, escaping a maze quickly, or collecting recyclables.
x??

---

#### Designing Reward Functions
Designing effective reward functions is crucial in reinforcement learning. For complex tasks like playing checkers or chess:
- Win: +1
- Lose: -1
- Draw and nonterminal positions: 0

However, rewards should not be too specific to avoid suboptimal behavior; for example, a chess agent should only be rewarded for winning the game, not just achieving certain board states.

:p What are some examples of reward functions in reinforcement learning?
??x
Examples of reward functions include:
- Walking: +1 per step based on forward motion.
- Maze Escape: +1 per time step until escape.
- Recycling Soda Cans: +1 for each can collected, -1 for collisions, and 0 otherwise.

For games like checkers or chess, rewards are designed to align with the main goal (winning) rather than intermediate steps.
x??

---

#### Return Calculation for Episodic Tasks
Episodic tasks are those where the interaction between the agent and environment can be naturally divided into episodes, each ending with a terminal state followed by a reset to a standard starting state. The return $G_t $ is defined as the sum of rewards from time step$t+1$ onwards.
:p What is the definition of return in episodic tasks?
??x
The return $G_t $ in episodic tasks is the sum of all future rewards starting from time step$t+1$:
$$G_t = R_{t+1} + R_{t+2} + R_{t+3} + \cdots + R_T$$where $ T$ is a final time step, and this sequence ends in the terminal state.
x??

---

#### Concept of Terminal State
In episodic tasks, episodes end with a special state known as the terminal state. This state signifies the completion of an episode before resetting to a standard starting state or sampling from a standard distribution of starting states for the next episode.
:p What is the role of the terminal state in episodic tasks?
??x
The terminal state marks the end of each episode, following which the environment resets and starts anew. It ensures that episodes are distinct and complete entities before moving on to another set of interactions.
x??

---

#### Definition of Continuing Tasks
Continuing tasks do not naturally break into episodes but continue indefinitely without a clear endpoint. These tasks might involve ongoing processes or applications where the interaction does not have a defined final state.
:p What distinguishes continuing tasks from episodic tasks?
??x
Continuing tasks differ from episodic tasks because they do not terminate in an obvious way and can continue indefinitely. Examples include long-term control systems or robotic applications with no clear end point, making the use of discounting necessary for defining return.
x??

---

#### Discounted Return for Continuing Tasks
For continuing tasks, direct summing of rewards is problematic as there's no natural terminal state to define a final time step $T $. Instead, discounted returns are used where future rewards are weighted by their time steps. The discounted return is defined using the discount rate $0 \leq \gamma \leq 1$.
:p How is the discounted return calculated for continuing tasks?
??x
The discounted return $G_t$ for continuing tasks is given by:
$$G_t = R_{t+1} + \gamma R_{t+2} + \gamma^2 R_{t+3} + \cdots = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \gamma^k R_{t+k+1}$$where $0 \leq \gamma \leq 1$ is the discount rate that reduces the value of rewards given further into the future.
x??

---

#### Role of Discounting in Return
Discounting helps manage infinite returns by reducing the value of future rewards. This prevents overly long-term strategies from dominating short-term rewards and ensures that immediate actions are considered more heavily than distant ones.
:p What is the role of discounting in return calculations?
??x
Discounting assigns lower values to future rewards, making them less influential compared to immediate rewards. This is represented mathematically by multiplying future rewards with a discount factor $\gamma^k$, ensuring that actions closer to the present have more impact on the agent's strategy.
x??

---

#### Episodic vs Continuing Tasks
Episodic tasks are naturally segmented into episodes, each ending in a terminal state. In contrast, continuing tasks do not have such natural breaks and can continue indefinitely. The choice between these affects how returns and rewards are calculated.
:p What is the difference between episodic and continuing tasks?
??x
In episodic tasks, interactions end in clear episodes defined by terminal states. These episodes allow for straightforward summing of rewards to calculate return. In contrast, continuing tasks do not have natural terminations, making direct summing impractical, necessitating discounted returns.
x??

---

#### Summary of Key Concepts
1. **Episodic Tasks**: Natural division into episodes with terminal states and reset to starting state.
2. **Terminal State**: Marks the end of an episode in episodic tasks.
3. **Continuing Tasks**: Indefinite interaction without natural terminations, requiring discounted returns for calculation.
4. **Discount Rate ($\gamma$)**: Determines the present value of future rewards, influencing the agent's long-term strategy.

---

#### Myopic Agents and Discounting
Myopic agents are concerned only with maximizing immediate rewards, which can be modeled by setting $\gamma = 0 $ in the return formula. If$\gamma < 1$, an infinite sum of reward terms can still converge to a finite value, provided that the sequence of rewards is bounded.
:p What does it mean for an agent to be "myopic"?
??x
An agent is "myopic" when it focuses solely on maximizing immediate rewards without considering future consequences. This means it makes decisions based only on the immediate reward at each step and does not take into account potential future rewards, which can lead to suboptimal long-term outcomes.
x??

---

#### Discounted Return in Reinforcement Learning
The discounted return $G_t $ is a key concept in reinforcement learning that considers the value of future rewards. It involves summing up future rewards weighted by$\gamma^k $, where $0 < \gamma < 1$.
:p What is the formula for the discounted return $G_t$?
??x
The formula for the discounted return $G_t$ is given by:
$$G_t = R_{t+1} + \gamma R_{t+2} + \gamma^2 R_{t+3} + \cdots$$

This can also be written as:
$$

G_t = R_{t+1} + \gamma (R_{t+2} + \gamma (R_{t+3} + \cdots))$$or$$

G_t = R_{t+1} + \gamma G_{t+1}$$where $0 < \gamma < 1$.
x??

---

#### Continuing vs. Episodic Tasks
In reinforcement learning, tasks can be categorized into continuing or episodic based on whether they terminate naturally or require explicit termination.
:p How do continuing and episodic tasks differ in the context of reinforcement learning?
??x
Continuing tasks continue indefinitely unless explicitly terminated by an external condition, whereas episodic tasks have natural endpoints. In episodic tasks, the return is often defined as the total reward collected over a single episode, while in continuing tasks, the return can be infinite if the agent can keep receiving positive rewards indefinitely.
x??

---

#### Pole-Balancing Example
The pole-balancing task involves keeping a pole upright on a cart by applying appropriate forces. It can be treated either as an episodic task where episodes end when the pole falls or as a continuing task with discounting applied to future rewards.
:p What are two ways of treating the pole-balancing problem in reinforcement learning?
??x
The pole-balancing problem can be treated as:
1. An **episodic task** where each episode ends when the pole falls past a certain angle, and the return is the number of time steps until failure.
2. A **continuing task** using discounting, where a reward of $\gamma $ is given for not failing at each step, and a penalty of$1 - \gamma$ is applied upon failure.
x??

---

#### Modified Equations for Episodic Tasks
For episodic tasks, the return formula needs to be adjusted slightly compared to continuing tasks. The modified version of equation (3.3) should account for the natural termination of episodes.
:p How do you modify the equations in Section 3.1 for an episodic task?
??x
For episodic tasks, the return $G_t$ is modified to:
$$G_t = \sum_{k=t+1}^{T}\gamma^k R_k$$where $ T$ is the termination time of the episode. This ensures that the return formula accounts for the finite number of steps in each episode.
x??

---

#### Return Calculation with Discounting
The discounted return at a given time step can be calculated using the recursive relationship derived from the definition of $G_t$.
:p What is the recursive relationship for calculating the return $G_t$?
??x
The return $G_t$ can be calculated recursively as:
$$G_t = R_{t+1} + \gamma G_{t+1}$$

This formula allows us to compute the discounted return by summing up immediate rewards and discounting future returns.

#### Example of Discounted Return Calculation
Given a sequence of rewards $R_1, R_2, R_3, R_4, R_5 $ with$\gamma = 0.5$, we can calculate the discounted return for each time step using the provided sequence and the discounting factor.
:p What are $G_0, G_1, ..., G_5 $ when$\gamma = 0.5 $ and the rewards are$R_1 = -1, R_2 = 2, R_3 = 6, R_4 = 3, R_5 = 2 $, with$ T = 5$?
??x
To calculate the discounted returns:
- Start from the end of the sequence and work backwards.
$$G_5 = R_6 + \gamma G_6 = 0 + 0.5 \cdot 0 = 0$$
$$

G_4 = R_5 + \gamma G_5 = 2 + 0.5 \cdot 0 = 2$$
$$

G_3 = R_4 + \gamma G_4 = 6 + 0.5 \cdot 2 = 7$$
$$

G_2 = R_3 + \gamma G_3 = 3 + 0.5 \cdot 7 = 5.5$$
$$

G_1 = R_2 + \gamma G_2 = -1 + 0.5 \cdot 5.5 = 2.25$$
$$

G_0 = R_1 + \gamma G_1 = -1 + 0.5 \cdot 2.25 = -0.25$$

Thus, the discounted returns are:
$$

G_0 = -0.25, G_1 = 2.25, G_2 = 5.5, G_3 = 7, G_4 = 2, G_5 = 0$$x??

#### Infinite Reward Sequence Example
For a reward sequence where the first reward is $R_1 = 2 $ and all subsequent rewards are constant at 7 with$\gamma = 0.9$, we can calculate the discounted returns.
:p What are $G_1 $ and$G_0 $ when$\gamma = 0.9 $ and the sequence is$R_1 = 2, R_2 = 7, R_3 = 7, \ldots$?
??x
To find $G_1$:
$$G_1 = R_1 + \gamma (R_2 + \gamma (R_3 + \cdots)) = 2 + 0.9 (7 + 0.9 (7 + 0.9 (\cdots)))$$

This is a geometric series:
$$

G_1 = 2 + 0.9 \cdot \frac{7}{1 - 0.9} = 2 + 0.9 \cdot 70 = 65.8$$

To find $G_0$:
$$G_0 = R_0 + \gamma (R_1 + \gamma (R_2 + \cdots)) = 0 + 0.9 (2 + 0.9 (7 + 0.9 (7 + \cdots)))$$

This is also a geometric series:
$$

G_0 = 0 + 0.9 \cdot 65.8 = 59.22$$

Thus, the discounted returns are:
$$

G_1 = 65.8, G_0 = 59.22$$x??

---

#### Proving the Discounted Return Formula
The second equality in equation (3.10) can be proven using algebraic manipulation and properties of geometric series.
:p How do you prove the second equality in equation (3.10)?
??x
The second equality in equation (3.10) is:
$$

G_t = R_{t+1} + \gamma \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \gamma^k R_{t+k+2} = R_{t+1} + \gamma G_{t+1}$$

Starting from the right-hand side:
$$

R_{t+1} + \gamma (R_{t+2} + \gamma (R_{t+3} + \cdots))$$

This can be rewritten as:
$$

R_{t+1} + \gamma (R_{t+2} + \gamma G_{t+2}) = R_{t+1} + \gamma G_{t+1}$$

Where $G_{t+1}$ is the discounted return starting from time step $t+1$:
$$G_{t+1} = R_{t+2} + \gamma (R_{t+3} + \cdots)$$

This completes the proof.

#### Unified Notation for Episodic and Continuing Tasks
Background context: In reinforcement learning, tasks are categorized into episodic and continuing. Episodic tasks have a finite sequence of time steps within each episode, while continuing tasks do not naturally break down into episodes. The book introduces unified notation to handle both types of tasks smoothly.

:p What is the primary challenge in using a single notation for both episodic and continuing tasks?
??x
The primary challenge is that episodic tasks are mathematically easier because actions affect only finite rewards within an episode, whereas continuing tasks involve infinite time steps. To unify these, special conventions are needed.
x??

---

#### Notation for Episodes and Actions in Episodic Tasks
Background context: In episodic tasks, each action affects a finite number of rewards during the episode. To handle this, we need to refer not only to $S_t $ but also to$S_{t,i}$,$ A_{t,i}$, etc., where $ i$ denotes the episode index.

:p How do we denote state and action at time $t$ in a specific episode?
??x
We use $S_{t,i}$ for the state representation at time $t$ of episode $i$, and similarly for actions, rewards, policies, etc. For example, if we are not distinguishing between episodes, we might simply write $ S_t$.
x??

---

#### Unified Return Calculation
Background context: Returns in episodic tasks can be summed over a finite number of terms, while in continuing tasks, returns sum over an infinite sequence. A unified approach is needed to handle both.

:p How do we unify the return calculation for episodic and continuing tasks?
??x
We introduce a special absorbing state that marks episode termination and transitions only to itself with zero rewards. This allows us to use the same formula for calculating the return as in continuing tasks: $G_t = \sum_{k=t+1}^T \gamma^{k-t-1} R_k $, where $ T $is the end of an episode, and$\gamma$ is the discount factor.
x??

---

#### General Return Formula
Background context: The unified return formula can be expressed as:
$$G_t = \sum_{k=t+1}^{\infty} \gamma^{k-t-1} R_k$$where $ T = 1$ if all episodes terminate, and the sum remains defined.

:p What is the general form of the return calculation in both episodic and continuing tasks?
??x
The general form of the return calculation is:
$$G_t = \sum_{k=t+1}^{\infty} \gamma^{k-t-1} R_k$$where $ T$ can be finite if episodes terminate, or infinite for continuing tasks.
x??

---

#### Episodic and Continuing Tasks Notation
Background context: The book uses conventions to write equations without explicitly referencing episode numbers when not needed. This helps in expressing the close parallels between episodic and continuing tasks.

:p How do we write the return $G_t$ in a simplified notation?
??x
We can write:
$$G_t = \sum_{k=t+1}^T \gamma^{k-t-1} R_k$$where $ T $ is the end of an episode if it terminates, or $\infty$ for continuing tasks. This unified form simplifies the notation and expresses both types of tasks.
x??

#### Policies and Value Functions
Background context: Reinforcement learning algorithms often involve estimating value functions, which are functions of states (or state-action pairs) that estimate how good it is to be in a given state or perform an action.

:p What do reinforcement learning algorithms typically involve?
??x
Reinforcement learning algorithms typically involve estimating value functions, which estimate the desirability of being in a state or performing an action in a state. These values are used to guide decision-making processes.
x??

---

#### Policy Definition and Notation
A policy is a mapping from states to probabilities of selecting each possible action. Specifically, for state $s $ and action$a $, if the agent is following policy$\pi $ at time$ t $, then $\pi(a|s)$ represents the probability that $ A_t = a $ given that $S_t = s$. This can be seen as an ordinary function, but the notation emphasizes it defines a distribution over actions for each state.
:p What is the definition of a policy in reinforcement learning?
??x
A policy $\pi $ in reinforcement learning is defined as a mapping from states to probabilities of selecting each possible action. Formally, if at time step$t $, the agent's current state is$ S_t = s $and it follows policy$\pi $, then $\pi(a|s)$ denotes the probability that the action taken at time $ t $ is $A_t = a$. This means for each state, there is a distribution over actions.
x??

---

#### Expectation of Future Reward
Given the current state $S_t = s $, and actions are selected according to policy $\pi $, we need to express the expectation of future reward $ R_{t+1}$in terms of $\pi$ and a four-argument function $p(3.2)$. The four-argument function likely represents the transition dynamics.
:p How can the expectation of $R_{t+1}$ be expressed using policy $\pi$?
??x
The expectation of $R_{t+1}$ given that actions are selected according to policy $\pi$, starting from state $ s$, can be written as:
$$E_\pi[R_{t+1}|S_t = s] = p(3.2, S_t=s, A_t=a, R_{t+1}) \cdot a$$where the four-argument function $ p$ likely represents the probability of transitioning to state and receiving reward given action and current state.
x??

---

#### Value Function Definition
The value function of a state under policy $\pi $, denoted as $ v_\pi(s)$, is defined as the expected return when starting in state $ s$and following policy $\pi$ thereafter. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:
$$v_\pi(s) = E_\pi\left[\sum_{k=0}^\infty \gamma^k R_{t+k+1}|S_t=s\right]$$where $0 < \gamma < 1$ is the discount factor.
:p What is the definition of the value function in terms of policy?
??x
The value function $v_\pi(s)$ for a state $ s $ under a policy $\pi$ is defined as the expected return when starting in state $ s $ and following $\pi$ thereafter. Formally:
$$v_\pi(s) = E_\pi\left[\sum_{k=0}^\infty \gamma^k R_{t+k+1}|S_t=s\right]$$where $0 < \gamma < 1$ is the discount factor that controls how much future rewards are valued.
x??

---

#### Action-Value Function Definition
The action-value function for a state and an action under policy $\pi $, denoted as $ q_\pi(s, a)$, represents the expected return starting from state $ s$, taking action $ a$, and thereafter following policy $\pi$. It is defined as:
$$q_\pi(s, a) = E_\pi\left[\sum_{k=0}^\infty \gamma^k R_{t+k+1}|S_t=s, A_t=a\right]$$:p What is the definition of the action-value function in terms of policy?
??x
The action-value function $q_\pi(s, a)$ for state $ s $ and action $ a $ under policy $\pi$ represents the expected return when starting from state $ s $, taking action $ a$, and then following policy $\pi$. Formally:
$$q_\pi(s, a) = E_\pi\left[\sum_{k=0}^\infty \gamma^k R_{t+k+1}|S_t=s, A_t=a\right]$$x??

---

#### Relationship Between Value Functions and Action-Value Function
The value function $v_\pi(s)$ can be expressed in terms of the action-value function $q_\pi$. Specifically:
$$v_\pi(s) = E_\pi[q_\pi(S_{t+1}, A_{t+1})|S_t=s]$$:p How is the value function related to the action-value function?
??x
The value function $v_\pi(s)$ for a state $ s $ under policy $\pi$ can be expressed as:
$$v_\pi(s) = E_\pi[q_\pi(S_{t+1}, A_{t+1})|S_t=s]$$

This equation states that the expected value of starting from state $s $, taking an action according to policy $\pi $, and then evaluating the immediate reward plus the discounted future rewards is equivalent to averaging over all possible next actions under $\pi$.
x??

---

#### Relationship Between Action-Value Function and Probability Distribution
The action-value function $q_\pi(s, a)$ can be expressed in terms of the value function $ v_\pi $ and the probability distribution given by policy $\pi$:
$$q_\pi(s, a) = E_\pi[R_{t+1} + \gamma v_\pi(S_{t+1})|S_t=s, A_t=a]$$:p How is the action-value function related to the value function and the probability distribution given by policy?
??x
The action-value function $q_\pi(s, a)$ for state $ s $ and action $ a $ under policy $\pi$ can be expressed as:
$$q_\pi(s, a) = E_\pi[R_{t+1} + \gamma v_\pi(S_{t+1})|S_t=s, A_t=a]$$

This equation states that the expected value of starting from state $s $, taking action $ a $, and then evaluating the immediate reward plus the discounted future rewards under policy$\pi$ is equivalent to considering both the immediate reward and the expected future value.
x??

---

#### Monte Carlo Methods for Estimation
Monte Carlo methods estimate values by averaging over many random samples of actual returns. For example, if an agent follows a policy $\pi$ and maintains an average of the actual returns that have followed each state, then as the number of times that state is encountered approaches infinity, this average will converge to the state's value.
:p How can value functions be estimated using Monte Carlo methods?
??x
Value functions can be estimated using Monte Carlo methods by maintaining an average of the actual returns that follow a given state. Specifically:
- For states: Keep an average of returns for each state $s $ encountered, which converges to$v_\pi(s)$.
- For actions in states: Maintain separate averages for each action taken in each state, which converge to $q_\pi(s, a)$.

This method involves averaging over many random samples of actual returns.
x??

---

#### Value Function and Bellman Equation

Background context: In reinforcement learning (RL), the value function $v_\pi(s)$ represents the expected return starting from state $s$ under policy $\pi$. The consistency condition for the value function is given by:

$$v_\pi(s) = E_\pi[G_t|S_t=s] = E_\pi[R_{t+1} + \gamma G_t | S_t=s]$$

Where:
- $G_t $ is the return starting from time step$t$.
- $R_{t+1}$ is the immediate reward at time $t+1$.
- $\gamma$ is the discount factor.

The Bellman equation for $v_\pi(s)$ can be expressed as:
$$v_\pi(s) = \sum_a \pi(a|s) \sum_{s', r} p(s', r | s, a) [r + \gamma v_\pi(s')]$$:p What is the Bellman equation for the value function $ v_\pi(s)$?
??x
The Bellman equation for the value function $v_\pi(s)$ states that the value of a state under policy $\pi$ is equal to the expected sum of discounted future rewards starting from that state. This is computed by considering all possible actions, next states, and rewards, weighted by their respective probabilities.

In pseudocode form, this can be expressed as:

```java
// Pseudocode for Bellman Update
function bellmanUpdate(v, S, A, pi, p, r, gamma) {
    for each state s in S do {
        v[s] = 0;
        for each action a in pi(s) do { // pi(s) is the policy function at state s
            for each next state s' and reward r given (s, a) do {
                v[s] += pi(a | s) * p(s', r | s, a) * (r + gamma * v[s']);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

x?

#### Transition and Reward Dynamics

Background context: The transition dynamics $p(s' | s, a)$ describe the probability of moving to state $s'$ given action $a$ in state $s$. Rewards $ r$are typically associated with these transitions. For any state $ s$, actions $ a \in A(s)$, and next states $ s' \in S$:

$$p(s', r | s, a)$$represents the probability of transitioning to state $ s'$and receiving reward $ r$.

:p What do $p(s', r | s, a)$ represent in reinforcement learning?
??x $p(s', r | s, a)$ represent the transition probabilities and rewards for moving from state $s$ to next state $s'$ given action $a$. They are used in the Bellman equation to calculate the expected value of future states and rewards.

For example:
- If an agent takes action $a $ in state$s $, it transitions to state$ s'$with probability $ p(s' | s, a)$.
- It also receives a reward $r $ from this transition, where$r $ is determined by the function$p(s', r | s, a)$.

In pseudocode, we can see how these dynamics are used in the update rule:

```java
// Pseudocode for calculating value of state s under policy pi
function calculateValue(v, S, A, pi, p, r, gamma) {
    for each state s in S do {
        v[s] = 0;
        for each action a in pi(s) do { // pi(s) is the policy function at state s
            for each next state s' and reward r given (s, a) do {
                v[s] += pi(a | s) * p(s', r | s, a) * (r + gamma * v[s']);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Gridworld Example

Background context: The gridworld is a classic example used to illustrate reinforcement learning concepts. It consists of a rectangular grid where the agent can move in four directions (north, south, east, west). Each action taken by the agent results in a transition to another cell on the grid according to predefined rules.

Example provided:
- At each cell, four actions are possible.
- Actions that take the agent off the grid leave its location unchanged and result in a reward of -1.
- Other actions yield a reward of 0 unless they move the agent out of special states A or B.
- From state A, all four actions yield +10 and transition to A'.
- From state B, all actions yield +5 and transition to B'.

:p Describe the dynamics in a gridworld example?
??x
In a gridworld example, the agent can move in four directions (north, south, east, west) from each cell. The environment transitions the agent based on the chosen action and associated probabilities.

- If an action would take the agent off the grid, its location remains unchanged but it incurs a reward of -1.
- Other actions result in no immediate reward unless they move the agent out of specific states (A or B).
- From state A, taking any action results in +10 reward and moving to state A'.
- From state B, taking any action results in +5 reward and moving to state B'.

The dynamics are defined by transition probabilities $p(s' | s, a)$ which determine the next state based on the current state and action. Rewards are also determined by these transitions.

#### Backup Diagrams for Policies

Background context: The provided text discusses backup diagrams for two types of value functions,$v^{\pi}$ and $q^{\pi}$, which are fundamental concepts in reinforcement learning. These diagrams illustrate how the expected return or action-value changes based on different policies.

:p What is the purpose of the backup diagrams in this context?
??x
The backup diagrams help visualize how the value function $v^{\pi}$(and similarly, the action-value function $ q^{\pi}$) evolves under a given policy $\pi$. These diagrams are useful for understanding the dynamics of the environment and the impact of different actions on the expected return.

---
#### Gridworld Example with Exceptional Reward Dynamics

Background context: The text describes a specific scenario in the Gridworld example, where the agent moves deterministically based on its action. There are exceptional reward dynamics at states A and B, which yield high immediate rewards but also have a chance of leading to the edge of the grid.

:p What are the key features of the Gridworld example described?
??x
The key features include:
- The grid is 4x5 cells.
- Actions (north, south, east, west) result in deterministic movements or a reward of -1 if they would move the agent out of bounds.
- Special states A and B yield rewards +10 and +5 respectively but moving from these states still results in a movement to their respective next states A' and B'.
- The immediate reward from state A is 10, while from B it is 5.

---
#### Value Function for Equiprobable Random Policy

Background context: The value function $v^{\pi}$ was computed under the assumption that the agent selects actions uniformly at random in all states. This scenario involves solving a system of linear equations to find the expected return over multiple steps, considering the discount factor $\gamma = 0.9$.

:p How is the value function $v^{\pi}$ calculated for an equiprobable random policy?
??x
The value function $v^{\pi}$ is calculated using the following formula derived from the Bellman expectation equation:
$$v^{\pi}(s) = \sum_{a} \pi(a|s) \sum_{s',r} p(s', r | s, a) [r + \gamma v^{\pi}(s')]$$
Given that all actions are chosen with equal probability ($\frac{1}{4}$), the equation simplifies to:
$$v^{\pi}(s) = \frac{1}{4} \sum_{a} \sum_{s', r} p(s', r | s, a) [r + 0.9 v^{\pi}(s')]$$---
#### Center State Value Verification

Background context: The text provides the value of a center state as $+0.7$, and asks to verify that this value holds by checking its relationship with its four neighboring states.

:p Verify the Bellman equation for the center state valued at +0.7.
??x
To verify, we use the Bellman equation:
$$v(s) = \sum_{a} \pi(a|s) \sum_{s',r} p(s', r | s, a) [r + \gamma v(s')]$$

Given that the center state $v(s) = 0.7 $, and its neighbors are valued at$+2.3 $,$+0.4 $,$-0.4 $, and $+0.7$:

$$0.7 = \frac{1}{4} (2.3 + 0.4 - 0.4 + 0.7) + 0.9 \cdot v(s')$$

Solving this, we get:
$$0.7 = \frac{1}{4} (3.0) + 0.9 \cdot 0.7$$
$$0.7 = 0.75 + 0.63 - 0.63 - 0.12$$
$$0.7 = 0.7$$

The equation holds true, confirming the value of $+0.7$.

---
Note: The code example here is not directly relevant but can be added for clarity in explaining the logic:
```java
// Example pseudocode to illustrate the calculation
public class GridworldValueFunction {
    private double discountFactor = 0.9;
    public double calculateValue(double centralState, List<Double> neighborStates) {
        // Central state value
        double v = centralState;
        
        // Calculate new value based on neighbors and Bellman equation
        for (double state : neighborStates) {
            v += (1 / 4) * (state + discountFactor * v);
        }
        return v;
    }
}
```

#### Understanding the Impact of Constant Rewards

Background context: In Exercise 3.15, we explore whether the signs of rewards are crucial or if only the intervals between them matter. We use a gridworld example where states have different rewards based on their position (goals, edges, and everywhere else). The key is to prove that adding a constant $c$ to all rewards does not affect the relative values of any states under any policies.

:p How can we prove that adding a constant $c $ to all rewards in a gridworld adds a constant$v_c$ to the values of all states?

??x
Adding a constant $c $ to all rewards will shift each state’s value by this same constant. Let's denote the original reward function as$r(s, a)$, and the modified reward function after adding $ c$as $ r'(s, a) = r(s, a) + c$. The value of any state $ s$under policy $\pi$ is given by:

$$v_{\pi}(s) = \sum_a \pi(a|s) \left( r(s, a) + \gamma \sum_{s'} p(s'|s,a)v_{\pi}(s') \right)$$

When we add the constant $c$:

$$v'_{\pi}(s) = \sum_a \pi(a|s) \left( (r(s, a) + c) + \gamma \sum_{s'} p(s'|s,a)v'_{\pi}(s') \right)$$

This can be rewritten as:
$$v'_{\pi}(s) = \sum_a \pi(a|s) \left( r(s, a) + \gamma \sum_{s'} p(s'|s,a)v'_{\pi}(s') + c \right)$$

Notice that the $c$ term is factored out:
$$v'_{\pi}(s) = \sum_a \pi(a|s) \left( r(s, a) + \gamma \sum_{s'} p(s'|s,a)v'_{\pi}(s') \right) + \sum_a \pi(a|s)c$$

The first part is the original value function $v_{\pi}(s)$, and the second part simplifies to:

$$c = v_c$$

Thus, we have shown that adding a constant $c $ to all rewards adds$v_c$ to the values of all states. This does not affect the relative values of any states under any policies.

#### Impact on Episodic Tasks

Background context: In Exercise 3.16, we consider how adding a constant $c$ affects episodic tasks like maze running compared to continuing tasks as in Exercise 3.15.

:p How does adding a constant $c$ affect the value function and policies for an episodic task?

??x
For episodic tasks such as maze running, where the episode terminates when reaching a goal or failing, adding a constant $c$ to all rewards does not change the overall structure of the problem. The termination condition (reaching the goal or hitting the edge) remains unchanged, and thus the relative values of states remain the same.

To formalize this:
- Let $v_{\pi}(s)$ be the value function for policy $\pi$ in a continuing task.
- For an episodic task with termination on reaching the goal or failing, adding $c$ to all rewards does not change the relative values of states since the terminal state's value remains 0 (or -1 if hitting the edge).

For example, consider a maze where reaching the exit is good and hitting walls bad. If we add a constant reward of +5 everywhere, it shifts all non-terminal states by +5 but leaves the optimal policy unchanged because the relative differences in values still determine the optimal actions.

#### Golf Example

Background context: In Example 3.6, we model playing a hole of golf using reinforcement learning concepts. The state is the ball's location, and actions are selecting clubs (putter or driver). We use the value function to represent the number of strokes required from each location.

:p What is the Bellman equation for action values in this context?

??x
The Bellman equation for action values $q_{\pi}(s,a)$ in this context describes how the expected return from a state-action pair evolves over time. For an optimal policy, we use the Bellman optimality equation:
$$q_{\pi^*}(s, a) = \sum_{s'} p(s'|s,a) \left[ r(s, a, s') + \gamma v_{\pi^*}(s') \right]$$

In this golf example:
- $s$ is the ball's location.
- $a$ can be "putter" or "driver".
- The value function $v_{\pi^*}(s)$ represents the negative number of strokes to complete the hole from state $s$.

Given that we always use the putter, let’s consider:

$$q_{\text{putt}}(s, a=\text{putter}) = -1 + \sum_{s'} p(s'|s,\text{putter}) v_{\pi^*}(s')$$

Where $v_{\pi^*}(s)$ is the value function for using only the putter.
