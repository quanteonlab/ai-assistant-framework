**Starting Chapter:** Monte Carlo Control without Exploring Starts

---

#### On-Policy Monte Carlo Control Without Exploring Starts
Monte Carlo control methods aim to find an optimal policy without assuming exploring starts. The main idea is to iteratively improve a policy by estimating its value function using returns from episodes generated according to that policy.

:p What is the objective of on-policy Monte Carlo control?
??x
The objective is to evaluate and improve the current policy rather than moving towards a completely greedy one, which can prevent further exploration. The algorithm uses first-visit Monte Carlo methods to estimate action-value functions and gradually shifts the policy towards an optimal one.
x??

---

#### \(\epsilon\)-Greedy Policies
\(\epsilon\)-greedy policies are a common approach used in on-policy control methods where most actions are chosen greedily based on current estimates, but with some probability \(\epsilon\) a random action is selected. This ensures that the policy remains stochastic and continues to explore.

:p What defines an \(\epsilon\)-greedy policy?
??x
An \(\epsilon\)-greedy policy assigns a minimal probability of selection to non-greedy actions, while the remaining bulk of the probability (1-\(\epsilon\)+\(\epsilon\) divided by number of actions) is given to the greedy action. Formally, for any state \(s\), if \(a^*\) is the greedy action with respect to the current action-value function \(Q(s, a)\):
\[
\pi(a|s) = 
\begin{cases} 
1 - \epsilon + \frac{\epsilon}{|A(s)|} & \text{if } a = a^* \\
\frac{\epsilon}{|A(s)|} & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]
x??

---

#### Policy Improvement Theorem
The policy improvement theorem is used to ensure that the policy remains improving towards an optimal one. It states that any \(\epsilon\)-greedy policy with respect to \(Q^*\) (the true optimal action-value function) will have a value function greater than or equal to any other \(\epsilon\)-soft policy.

:p How does the policy improvement theorem apply in this context?
??x
The policy improvement theorem states that if \(\pi_0\) is an \(\epsilon\)-greedy policy, then:
\[
v_{\pi}(s) \leq v_{\pi_0}(s)
\]
for all states \(s\), with equality holding only when both policies are optimal among the \(\epsilon\)-soft policies. This ensures that moving towards an \(\epsilon\)-greedy policy is beneficial and prevents premature convergence to a non-optimal policy.

#### On-Policy First-Visit Monte Carlo Control Algorithm
The algorithm uses first-visit Monte Carlo methods to estimate action-value functions and improve the current policy by shifting it towards an \(\epsilon\)-greedy one. It involves generating episodes, updating estimates of \(Q(s, a)\), and adjusting the policy.

:p Describe the main steps of the on-policy first-visit Monte Carlo control algorithm.
??x
The main steps of the algorithm are:
1. Initialize: Set up an arbitrary \(\epsilon\)-soft policy \(\pi\) and action-value functions \(Q(s, a)\).
2. For each episode:
   - Generate an episode following \(\pi\): \(S_0, A_0, R_1, ..., S_T-1, A_{T-1}, R_T\)
   - Loop through the steps in reverse order to update action-value estimates and policy.
3. Update: For each state-action pair, compute the average of returns to get new \(Q(s, a)\) values.
4. Policy Improvement: Set \(\pi(a|s)\) to be an \(\epsilon\)-greedy distribution over actions.

Code Example:
```java
public class MonteCarloControl {
    private double epsilon;
    private ActionValueFunction Q;

    public MonteCarloControl(double epsilon) {
        this.epsilon = epsilon;
        this.Q = new ActionValueFunction();
    }

    public void updatePolicy() {
        for (State state : Q.getStates()) {
            double greedyActionValue = Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY;
            int greedyActionIndex = -1;
            // Find the greedy action
            for (int i = 0; i < Q.getActionCount(state); i++) {
                if (Q.getValue(state, i) > greedyActionValue) {
                    greedyActionValue = Q.getValue(state, i);
                    greedyActionIndex = i;
                }
            }
            // Update policy to be epsilon-greedy
            for (int i = 0; i < Q.getActionCount(state); i++) {
                if (i == greedyActionIndex) {
                    Q.setProbability(state, i, 1 - epsilon + epsilon / Q.getActionCount(state));
                } else {
                    Q.setProbability(state, i, epsilon / Q.getActionCount(state));
                }
            }
        }
    }

    public void train() {
        while (true) {
            // Generate an episode and update action-value estimates
            Episode episode = generateEpisode();
            for (StateActionPair pair : episode.getReturns()) {
                double returnSum = 0;
                for (int i = pair.getTimeStep(); i < episode.getSteps().size(); i++) {
                    returnSum += episode.getReward(i);
                }
                Q.update(pair.getState(), pair.getAction(), returnSum);
            }
            updatePolicy();
        }
    }
}
```

#### Equivalence in New Environment
The equivalence in the new environment ensures that any \(\epsilon\)-soft policy is better or equal to its \(\epsilon\)-greedy counterpart. This is used to prove that moving towards an \(\epsilon\)-greedy policy is beneficial.

:p How does the equivalence in the new environment work?
??x
In a modified environment, policies are required to be \(\epsilon\)-soft. If in state \(s\) and action \(a\):
- With probability \(1 - \epsilon\), the behavior matches the original environment.
- With probability \(\epsilon\), an action is repicked randomly.

The best one can do with general policies here is equivalent to doing well with \(\epsilon\)-soft policies in the original environment. The optimal value function for this new environment, \(v^*\), aligns with the optimal policy among \(\epsilon\)-soft ones.

#### Oﬄ-Policy Prediction via Importance Sampling
Background context: This section discusses oﬄ-policy prediction, a technique used in reinforcement learning to estimate values for an optimal policy using data generated by a different (more exploratory) behavior policy. The goal is to find the best action values without directly following the optimal policy during exploration.

:p What is oﬄ-policy learning and how does it differ from on-policy methods?
??x
Oﬄ-policy learning involves estimating the value function for a target policy using data generated by a different (behavior) policy. Unlike on-policy methods, which use the same policy for both generating experience and updating values, oﬄ-policy methods can use behavior policies that are more exploratory or suboptimal to generate data.

In pseudocode:
```python
for episode in episodes_from_behavior_policy:
    states, actions, rewards = process_episode(episode)
    target_value = estimate_value(states, actions, rewards, target_policy)
```
x??

---

#### Target Policy vs. Behavior Policy
Background context: In the context of oﬄ-policy learning, two policies are used—a target policy that is learned about and an optimal policy, and a behavior policy used to generate data. The behavior policy should ensure sufficient exploration.

:p What are the target and behavior policies in oﬄ-policy learning?
??x
In oﬄ-policy learning, the **target policy** (\(\pi\)) is the policy whose value function we want to estimate or learn. This policy is typically deterministic and represents the optimal policy that we aim to improve upon. The **behavior policy** (b) is used to generate data (episodes) but can be more exploratory.

In pseudocode:
```python
target_policy = determine_optimal_policy()
behavior_policy = choose_exploratory_policy()
```
x??

---

#### Coverage Assumption
Background context: To estimate values for the target policy using episodes from a behavior policy, we need to ensure that every action taken under the target policy is also performed (at least occasionally) by the behavior policy. This assumption is known as **coverage**.

:p What is the coverage assumption in oﬄ-policy learning?
??x
The **coverage assumption** ensures that for any state-action pair where the target policy (\(\pi\)) takes an action, the behavior policy (b) also takes this action with some non-zero probability. Mathematically:
\[ \text{If } \pi(a|s) > 0, \text{ then } b(a|s) > 0. \]

This means that for any state \(s\) and action \(a\), if the target policy would take action \(a\), the behavior policy must also occasionally choose this action in states similar to \(s\).

x??

---

#### Importance Sampling
Background context: To estimate values using data from a different policy, importance sampling is used. This technique adjusts the learning process by weighting episodes according to how likely they are under both policies.

:p How does importance sampling work in oﬄ-policy prediction?
??x
Importance sampling involves adjusting the value estimates based on the probability of each episode being generated by the behavior policy (b) compared to the target policy (\(\pi\)). The basic idea is:
\[ V^\pi(s) = \mathbb{E}_{b}[\sum_{t=0}^{T-1} \gamma^t R_t | S_0=s] / P_b(S_0=s). \]

The importance sampling weight for each state-action pair \((s, a)\) is given by:
\[ w(s, a) = \frac{\pi(a|s)}{b(a|s)}. \]

In pseudocode:
```python
for episode in episodes_from_behavior_policy:
    states, actions, rewards = process_episode(episode)
    importance_weights = calculate_importance_weights(states, actions, target_policy)
    value_estimate = estimate_value_with_weights(states, actions, rewards, importance_weights)
```
x??

---

#### Deterministic Target Policy Example
Background context: In control applications, the target policy is often deterministic and greedy with respect to the current action-value function. The behavior policy remains stochastic for exploration.

:p How is a deterministic target policy used in oﬄ-policy learning?
??x
A **deterministic target policy** in reinforcement learning uses the action that maximizes the estimated value function at each state. This policy becomes more and more optimal as the estimate of the action-value function improves, but it does not explore new actions.

For example, if \(\hat{Q}(s, a)\) is the current estimate of the action-value function:
\[ \pi(a|s) = \begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } a = \arg\max_a \hat{Q}(s, a), \\
0 & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases} \]

The behavior policy, such as an \(\epsilon\)-greedy policy, remains stochastic to explore the environment:
\[ b(a|s) = \begin{cases} 
1 - \epsilon + \frac{\epsilon}{A} & \text{if } a = \arg\max_a \hat{Q}(s, a), \\
\frac{\epsilon}{A} & \text{otherwise},
\end{cases} \]
where \(A\) is the number of actions.

x??

#### Importance Sampling Ratio Definition
Importance sampling is a technique used to estimate expected values under one distribution given samples from another. In o↵-policy learning, it's applied by weighting returns based on the relative probability of trajectories under different policies.

Relevant formulas:
\[
\Pi_{t:T-1} = \prod_{k=t}^{T-1}\frac{\pi(A_k|S_k)}{b(A_k|S_k)}
\]
Where:
- \( \Pi_{t:T-1} \) is the importance-sampling ratio.
- \( b(\cdot | \cdot ) \) and \( \pi(\cdot | \cdot ) \) are the behavior policy and target policy, respectively.

:p What is the formula for the importance-sampling ratio?
??x
The formula for the importance-sampling ratio is:
\[
\Pi_{t:T-1} = \prod_{k=t}^{T-1}\frac{\pi(A_k|S_k)}{b(A_k|S_k)}
\]
This represents the relative probability of a trajectory under two different policies. The numerator and denominator cancel out the state transition probabilities, leaving only policy differences.
x??

---

#### Expected Return with Importance Sampling
The expected return using importance sampling is adjusted to match the target policy's expectation.

Relevant formula:
\[
E[\Pi_{t:T-1} G_t | S_t = s] = v_\pi(s)
\]
Where:
- \( \Pi_{t:T-1} \) is the importance-sampling ratio.
- \( G_t \) is the return from time step \( t \).

:p What does this formula represent?
??x
This formula represents that when weighted by the importance-sampling ratio, the expected return under a behavior policy aligns with the target policy's value function. Specifically:
\[
E[\Pi_{t:T-1} G_t | S_t = s] = v_\pi(s)
\]
This means that adjusting the returns using the importance-sampling ratio corrects for the mismatch in expectations between the policies.
x??

---

#### Monte Carlo Algorithm for O↵-Policy Prediction
The algorithm averages the adjusted returns to estimate the value under the target policy.

Relevant code:
```java
for (State s : states) {
    Set<Integer> T = new HashSet<>();
    double V = 0;
    int count = 0;
    
    for (Episode episode : batch) {
        for (int t = 1; t <= episode.length(); t++) {
            if (episode.state(t) == s) {
                T.add(t);
                Gt = episode.return(t, episode.terminateTime(t));
                ratio = productOfImportanceSamplingRatios(episode, t);
                V += ratio * Gt;
                count++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    V(s) = V / count; // Average the adjusted returns
}
```

:p What is the purpose of this algorithm?
??x
The purpose of this Monte Carlo algorithm is to estimate the value function \( v_\pi(s) \) under a target policy \( \pi \), using data generated by a behavior policy \( b \). It scales each return \( G_t \) with the importance-sampling ratio and then averages them.

Explanation:
- Collect all time steps where state \( s \) is visited.
- For each visit, compute the adjusted return \( \Pi_{t:T(t)-1} G_t \).
- Average these adjusted returns to estimate \( v_\pi(s) \).

Example pseudocode:

```java
public class MonteCarloOEOplicyPrediction {
    public void predictValueFunction() {
        for (State s : states) {
            Set<Integer> T = new HashSet<>();
            double V = 0;
            int count = 0;

            for (Episode episode : batch) {
                for (int t = 1; t <= episode.length(); t++) {
                    if (episode.state(t) == s) {
                        T.add(t);
                        Gt = episode.return(t, episode.terminateTime(t));
                        ratio = productOfImportanceSamplingRatios(episode, t);
                        V += ratio * Gt;
                        count++;
                    }
                }
            }

            V(s) = V / count; // Average the adjusted returns
        }
    }
}
```

#### Ordinary Importance Sampling vs Weighted Importance Sampling

Ordinary importance sampling uses a simple average of weighted returns, while weighted importance sampling uses a weighted average.

Relevant formulas:
- Ordinary Importance Sampling:
  \[
  V(s) = \frac{\sum_{t \in T(s)} \Pi_{t:T(t)-1} G_t}{|T(s)|}
  \]
- Weighted Importance Sampling:
  \[
  V(s) = \frac{\sum_{t \in T(s)} \Pi_{t:T(t)-1} G_t}{\sum_{t \in T(s)} \Pi_{t:T(t)-1}}
  \]

:p What is the difference between ordinary and weighted importance sampling?
??x
The key difference lies in how they handle the weights of the returns:

- **Ordinary Importance Sampling**:
  Uses a simple average of the weighted returns.
  \[
  V(s) = \frac{\sum_{t \in T(s)} \Pi_{t:T(t)-1} G_t}{|T(s)|}
  \]

- **Weighted Importance Sampling**:
  Uses a weighted average, normalizing by the sum of weights.
  \[
  V(s) = \frac{\sum_{t \in T(s)} \Pi_{t:T(t)-1} G_t}{\sum_{t \in T(s)} \Pi_{t:T(t)-1}}
  \]

This means that weighted importance sampling adjusts each return by the importance-sampling ratio and then averages them, while ordinary importance sampling does a simple average.

Example:
```java
public class ImportanceSampling {
    public double estimateValue() {
        for (State s : states) {
            Set<Integer> T = new HashSet<>();
            double V = 0;
            int count = 0;
            
            for (Episode episode : batch) {
                for (int t = 1; t <= episode.length(); t++) {
                    if (episode.state(t) == s) {
                        T.add(t);
                        Gt = episode.return(t, episode.terminateTime(t));
                        ratio = productOfImportanceSamplingRatios(episode, t);
                        
                        // Ordinary Importance Sampling
                        V += ratio * Gt;
                        count++;
                    }
                }
            }
            
            V(s) = V / count; // Simple average
            
            double weightedV = 0;
            int weightedCount = 0;
            
            for (Episode episode : batch) {
                for (int t = 1; t <= episode.length(); t++) {
                    if (episode.state(t) == s) {
                        T.add(t);
                        Gt = episode.return(t, episode.terminateTime(t));
                        ratio = productOfImportanceSamplingRatios(episode, t);
                        
                        // Weighted Importance Sampling
                        weightedV += ratio * Gt;
                        weightedCount++;
                    }
                }
            }
            
            V(s) = weightedV / weightedCount; // Weighted average
        }
    }
}
```

#### Weighted-Average Estimate and Observed Return
Background context: In the weighted-average estimate, the ratio \(\frac{\pi(t)}{b(t)}\) for a single return cancels out in the numerator and denominator. As a result, the estimate is equal to the observed return, independent of the ratio (assuming the ratio is nonzero). Given that this return was the only one observed, it makes sense as an estimate but has certain statistical properties.

:p What happens to the weighted-average estimate when there's only one observed return?
??x
The weighted-average estimate becomes simply the observed return. This is because the ratio \(\frac{\pi(t)}{b(t)}\) cancels out in the formula for the estimate, leaving just the observed return. However, this estimate has a bias towards \(v_{\pi}(s)\) rather than being unbiased.
x??

---

#### First-Visit Importance-Sampling Estimator
Background context: The first-visit version of the ordinary importance-sampling estimator is always unbiased in expectation (i.e., it estimates \(v_{\pi}(s)\)). However, this can result in extreme values if the trajectory observed under the behavior policy has a very low likelihood under the target policy.

:p What happens with an extremely likely trajectory according to \(\pi\) but unlikely according to \(b\)?
??x
The ordinary importance-sampling estimate would be ten times the observed return if the ratio were ten. This is because the estimate multiplies the observed return by the inverse of the likelihood ratio, making it quite different from the observed return even though the episode's trajectory is representative of \(\pi\).
x??

---

#### Bias and Variance Comparison
Background context: Ordinary importance sampling is unbiased but can have an unbounded variance due to potentially unbounded likelihood ratios. Weighted importance sampling has a bias that converges to zero asymptotically, yet it generally has lower variance because the largest weight on any single return is one.

:p Compare the biases and variances of ordinary vs weighted importance sampling.
??x
Ordinary importance sampling is unbiased but can have an unbounded variance due to potentially unbounded likelihood ratios. Weighted importance sampling, while biased with a bias that converges to zero as the number of samples increases, has a lower variance because the largest weight on any single return is one. Assuming bounded returns, the weighted estimator's variance can converge to zero even if the variance of the ratios themselves is infinite.
x??

---

#### MC Estimation in Blackjack
Background context: Consider an MDP with a single nonterminal state and a single action that transitions back to the same state or ends the episode based on probability \(p\). The reward for each transition is +1. Let \(\gamma = 1\).

:p What are the first-visit and every-visit estimators of the value of the nonterminal state given an observed return of 10 over a 10-step trajectory?
??x
For the first-visit estimator, it would be the same as the ordinary importance-sampling estimate since there is only one visit to the state. Given a return of 10 and assuming \(\pi(t)/b(t)\) cancels out, the value is simply the observed return, which is 10.

For the every-visit estimator, it also considers all visits but converges to \(v_{\pi}(s)\). With only one state and trajectory lasting 10 steps with a +1 reward each time, the expected value would be close to 10 under repeated sampling.
x??

---

#### Every-Visit Methods for Importance Sampling
Background context: Both first-visit and every-visit methods of importance sampling are biased but their bias converges to zero as the number of samples increases. The every-visit method is often preferred due to its simplicity in implementation and extension to function approximation.

:p What are the characteristics of every-visit methods for both ordinary and weighted importance-sampling?
??x
Every-visit methods for both types of importance sampling are biased but their bias converges to zero as the number of samples increases. They remove the need to track visited states, making them simpler to implement. Additionally, they can be extended more easily using function approximation.
x??

---

#### Importance Sampling Overview
Importance sampling is a technique used to estimate properties of a particular distribution, while only having samples generated from a different distribution. It's particularly useful in reinforcement learning for off-policy evaluation.

:p What is importance sampling?
??x
Importance sampling allows us to approximate the expectation under one distribution (target policy) using samples from another distribution (behavior policy). This technique is crucial in off-policy evaluation and prediction tasks.
x??

---

#### Weighted Importance Sampling vs Ordinary Importance Sampling
Weighted importance sampling adjusts for the difference between the behavior policy and the target policy, leading to lower variance compared to ordinary importance sampling. Ordinary importance sampling can have infinite variance if certain conditions are met.

:p How does weighted importance sampling differ from ordinary importance sampling?
??x
Weighted importance sampling adjusts each sample's weight based on the ratio of probabilities under the target and behavior policies, reducing variance. In contrast, ordinary importance sampling does not account for these differences in policy, leading to potentially infinite variance.
x??

---

#### Example 5.3: Blackjack State Evaluation
In this example, we evaluate a specific state (dealer showing deuce, player sum is 13 with usable ace) using both off-policy methods under the target policy of sticking on 20 or 21.

:p What was the value estimated for the given state in Example 5.3?
??x
The value of the state was approximately 0.27726, determined by averaging returns from episodes generated by following the target policy.
x??

---

#### Figure 5.3: Error Comparison Between Methods
Figure 5.3 illustrates how weighted importance sampling produces lower error estimates compared to ordinary importance sampling for off-policy learning.

:p What did Figure 5.3 show about the methods' performance?
??x
Figure 5.3 demonstrated that weighted importance sampling had much lower initial error compared to ordinary importance sampling when estimating the value of a single blackjack state using off-policy episodes.
x??

---

#### Infinite Variance in Importance Sampling
Infinite variance can occur in off-policy learning due to loops in trajectories, leading to unsatisfactory convergence properties for ordinary importance sampling.

:p Why does infinite variance occur in off-policy learning?
??x
Infinite variance occurs because the scaled returns have infinite variance when there are loops in trajectories. This is common in off-policy learning as the same state-action pair can be revisited multiple times with varying rewards.
x??

---

#### Example 5.4: One-State MDP
The example (Example 5.4) illustrates a simple one-state Markov Decision Process where importance sampling fails due to infinite variance.

:p Describe the one-state MDP in Example 5.4.
??x
In the one-state MDP, there is only one non-terminal state \( s \), two actions: right and left. The right action leads to termination with a reward of 0, while the left action transitions back to \( s \) 90% of the time or directly to termination with a reward of +1 10% of the time.

The target policy always selects "left". All episodes under this policy consist of some number of transitions back and forth between \( s \) and termination.
x??

---
#### Convergence Issues in Ordinary Importance Sampling
Ordinary importance sampling can produce unstable estimates due to infinite variance, especially when there are loops in trajectories.

:p Why do ordinary importance sampling estimates diverge?
??x
Ordinary importance sampling can diverge because the scaled returns have infinite variance if the behavior policy revisits states infinitely often. This leads to unreliable convergence properties.
x??

#### Code Example for Importance Sampling

:p Provide a simple example of how importance sampling works in pseudocode.
??x
```java
public class ImportanceSamplingExample {
    double totalReturn = 0;
    int numEpisodes = 100000;

    public void run() {
        for (int episode = 0; episode < numEpisodes; episode++) {
            State state = initialState();
            while (!state.isTerminal()) {
                Action action = behaviorPolicy(state);
                state, reward = takeAction(action);
                totalReturn += reward * importanceSamplingWeight(action, state);
            }
        }
        double estimatedValue = totalReturn / numEpisodes;
        System.out.println("Estimated Value: " + estimatedValue);
    }

    private double importanceSamplingWeight(Action action, State state) {
        return targetPolicyProbability(action, state) / behaviorPolicyProbability(action, state);
    }
}
```

This pseudocode demonstrates the basic structure of using importance sampling to estimate values by adjusting weights based on policy differences.

#### Importance Sampling for Value Estimates
Background context explaining the concept of importance sampling and how it relates to Monte Carlo methods. The provided text discusses the use of ordinary and weighted importance-sampling algorithms for estimating value functions in reinforcement learning.

:p Explain why the estimates using ordinary importance sampling fail to converge correctly, while weighted importance sampling always converges.
??x
The ordinary importance sampling algorithm uses a ratio of policy probabilities to weight returns, which can lead to large variances and non-convergence because some episodes contribute zero due to the target policy's behavior. In contrast, the weighted importance-sampling algorithm only considers returns consistent with the target policy, leading to a more stable estimate.

```java
// Pseudocode for Weighted Importance Sampling
public double weightedImportanceSampling(State s, Action a) {
    double weight = 1.0;
    while (true) {
        State nextS = takeAction(a);
        if (nextS.isTerminal()) break;
        weight *= targetPolicy(nextS).getProbabilityOf(a) / policy(nextS).getProbabilityOf(a);
        a = chooseAction(nextS); // Choose action based on the current policy
    }
    return weight * getReturn();
}
```

#### Calculation of Infinite Variance for Importance Sampling

:p Show how to calculate that the variance of importance-sampling-scaled returns is infinite in this example.
??x
To show that the variance of the importance-sampling-scaled returns is infinite, we need to evaluate the expected value of the square of the scaled return. The key observation is that only episodes ending with a left action contribute non-zero values to the importance sampling ratio.

\[
E[b^2 \prod_{t=0}^{T-1} \frac{\pi(A_t|S_t)}{b(A_t|S_t) G_0}] = 0.1 \sum_{k=0}^\infty (0.9)^k (2k+1)
\]

This series diverges, indicating that the variance is infinite.

```java
// Pseudocode for calculating the expectation of squared importance-sampling ratios
public double calculateVariance() {
    double total = 0;
    for (int k = 0; ; k++) {
        double probEpisode = Math.pow(0.9, k);
        double importanceRatio = 2 * k + 1;
        total += probEpisode * importanceRatio * importanceRatio;
    }
    return total; // This will theoretically diverge
}
```

#### Action Value Estimates with Importance Sampling

:p Derive the equation analogous to (5.6) for action values \(Q(s, a)\).
??x
The equation for action value estimates using importance sampling is similar but involves summing over actions instead of states:

\[
Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \frac{\pi(A|S)}{b(A|S)} (G_0 - Q(s, a))
\]

Where \(G_0\) is the return and \(b(A|S)\) is the importance sampling ratio for action \(A\) in state \(S\).

```java
// Pseudocode for updating action values with weighted importance-sampling
public void updateActionValues(State s, Action a, double alpha, double G0) {
    double weight = targetPolicy(s).getProbabilityOf(a) / policy(s).getProbabilityOf(a);
    Q[s][a] += alpha * weight * (G0 - Q[s][a]);
}
```

#### Behavior of Learning Curves with Importance Sampling

:p Explain why the error first increases and then decreases for the weighted importance-sampling method in learning curves.
??x
The initial increase in error can occur because, initially, the algorithm might not have enough data to accurately estimate the action values. As more episodes are collected, the estimates become more refined, leading to a decrease in error.

```java
// Pseudocode for weighted importance sampling learning curve
public void train(int episodes) {
    for (int i = 0; i < episodes; i++) {
        State s = initial_state();
        while (!s.isTerminal()) {
            Action a = chooseAction(s);
            double G0 = simulateEpisode(s, a); // Simulate until terminal state
            updateActionValues(s, a, alpha, G0);
            s = nextState(s, a);
        }
    }
}
```

#### Variance of Estimator with Every-Visit MC

:p Would the variance of the estimator still be infinite if an every-visit MC method was used instead?
??x
No, the variance would not necessarily be infinite. The every-visit Monte Carlo method updates action values based on all visits to a state-action pair, which can smooth out the noisy estimates and reduce the variance.

```java
// Pseudocode for every-visit MC update
public void updateActionValuesEveryVisit(State s, Action a, double G0) {
    Q[s][a] = (N[s][a] * Q[s][a] + G0) / (N[s][a] + 1);
}
```

#### Incremental Monte Carlo Implementation

**Background context:** Monte Carlo methods can be implemented incrementally on an episode-by-episode basis, similar to how they were described in Chapter 2. However, instead of averaging rewards directly, we average returns. This is relevant for both on-policy and off-policy methods.

:p What are the key differences between implementing Monte Carlo prediction using rewards versus returns?
??x
The key difference lies in the averaging step: In traditional Monte Carlo methods, we average over actual observed rewards to estimate values. However, when dealing with returns (G), which include all future rewards from a state or action, we use the formula for estimating value functions based on these returns rather than just immediate rewards.

For instance, if using ordinary importance sampling:
```java
// Pseudocode for updating Q(s, a) using returns G
double return = 0;
for (int t = t_start; t < T; t++) {
    return += rewards[t];
}
Q(s, a) = (1 - alpha) * Q(s, a) + alpha * return;
```
x??

---

#### Ordinary Importance Sampling

**Background context:** In off-policy Monte Carlo methods using ordinary importance sampling, the returns are scaled by the importance sampling ratio \(\rho_t\), which is defined as:
\[
\rho_t = \frac{\pi(A_t|S_t)}{b(A_t|S_t)}
\]
where \(b\) is the behavior policy and \(\pi\) is the target policy. This scaling ensures that the returns are adjusted to reflect what we would have observed under the target policy.

:p How does ordinary importance sampling scale the returns?
??x
Ordinary importance sampling scales the returns by multiplying them with the importance sampling ratio, \(\rho_t\). This adjustment accounts for the difference in probabilities of taking an action \(A_t\) in state \(S_t\) according to the behavior and target policies. The updated return is then used in the value update equation.

For example:
```java
// Pseudocode for updating Q(s, a) using importance sampling
double importanceSamplingRatio = 1.0; // Initialize to 1.0 if b(A|S) == π(A|S)
for (int t = t_start; t < T; t++) {
    importanceSamplingRatio *= pi[a[t]|s[t]] / behaviorPolicy[a[t]|s[t]];
}
double return = 0;
for (int t = t_start; t < T; t++) {
    return += rewards[t] * importanceSamplingRatio;
}
Q(s, a) = (1 - alpha) * Q(s, a) + alpha * return;
```
x??

---

#### Weighted Importance Sampling

**Background context:** For off-policy methods using weighted importance sampling, the returns are not only scaled but also given weights that reflect their relative importance. This leads to a more complex incremental update rule.

:p What is the formula for updating \(V_n\) in the case of weighted importance sampling?
??x
The formula for updating \(V_n\) in weighted importance sampling is:
\[
V_{n+1} = V_n + \frac{W_n(G_n - V_n)}{\sum_{k=1}^{n} W_k}
\]
where \(G_n\) is the return at step \(n\), and \(W_n\) is the weight assigned to this return.

This update ensures that returns are weighted appropriately, leading to a more accurate estimate of the value function. The cumulative sum of weights \(C_n\) helps in maintaining the running average.

For example:
```java
// Pseudocode for updating V using weighted importance sampling
double C = 0; // Cumulative weight
for (int n = 1; n <= N; n++) {
    double G = returns[n];
    double W = weights[n];
    C += W;
    V = (V * n + G * W) / (n + W);
}
```

#### Episode-by-Episode Incremental Algorithm for Monte Carlo Policy Evaluation

**Background context:** The incremental implementation of off-policy Monte Carlo methods can be achieved by processing each episode as a sequence of steps, updating the value function \(Q(s, a)\) based on returns and their corresponding weights.

:p What is the incremental update rule for Q(s, a) in off-policy Monte Carlo control using weighted importance sampling?
??x
The incremental update rule for \(Q(s, a)\) in off-policy Monte Carlo control using weighted importance sampling is:
\[
V_{n+1} = V_n + \frac{W_n(G_n - V_n)}{\sum_{k=1}^{n} W_k}
\]
where \(G_n\) is the return at step \(n\), and \(W_n\) is the weight assigned to this return.

This update ensures that the value function \(Q(s, a)\) converges to the correct target policy values as more episodes are processed. The cumulative sum of weights \(C_n\) helps in maintaining the running average efficiently.

For example:
```java
// Pseudocode for updating Q(s, a) incrementally
double C = 0; // Cumulative weight
for (int n = 1; n <= N; n++) {
    double G = returns[n];
    double W = weights[n];
    C += W;
    V = (V * n + G * W) / (n + W);
}
```

#### Off-Policy Monte Carlo Control

**Background context:** Off-policy methods in Monte Carlo control separate the policy used for behavior generation from the target policy. The behavior policy can be soft and explore all actions, while the target policy is often greedy with respect to an estimated value function.

:p How does off-policy Monte Carlo control work?
??x
Off-policy Monte Carlo control works by generating episodes using a behavior policy \(b\) that may differ from the target policy \(\pi\). The goal is to learn and improve the target policy based on returns generated by following the behavior policy. The key steps include:

1. **Initialization:** Initialize value function estimates \(Q(s, a)\) arbitrarily.
2. **Policy Evaluation:** Generate episodes using a soft policy \(b\) that explores all actions.
3. **Update Rule:** For each return in an episode, update the value function using weighted importance sampling:
   \[
   V_{n+1} = V_n + \frac{W_n(G_n - V_n)}{\sum_{k=1}^{n} W_k}
   \]
4. **Policy Improvement:** After processing an episode, if the action taken was not greedy according to \(Q(s, a)\), move on to the next episode.

For example:
```java
// Pseudocode for off-policy Monte Carlo control
double C = 0; // Cumulative weight
for (int n = 1; n <= N; n++) {
    double G = returns[n];
    double W = weights[n];
    C += W;
    V = (V * n + G * W) / (n + W);
}
```

#### Racetrack Problem

**Background context:** The racetrack problem is a simplified racing environment where the goal is to maximize speed while avoiding collisions. It involves discrete states and actions, with velocity components changing in steps.

:p What are the key features of the racetrack problem?
??x
The key features of the racetrack problem include:

1. **Discrete States:** The car's position on a grid.
2. **Discrete Actions:** Incrementing or decrementing the velocity components by +1, -1, or 0.
3. **Goal:** Maximizing speed while ensuring the car stays within the track boundaries.
4. **Rewards:** Negative rewards for each step until reaching the finish line; penalties for leaving the track.

The problem requires designing a policy that can handle both exploration and exploitation effectively to optimize performance over episodes.

For example:
```java
// Pseudocode for handling racetrack actions
for (int t = 0; t < T; t++) {
    int[] velocityChange = {0, 0}; // Change in x and y directions

    if (Math.random() < epsilon) { // Exploration with probability ε
        Random r = new Random();
        int actionIndex = r.nextInt(NUM_ACTIONS);
        velocityChange = ACTION_SET[actionIndex];
    } else { // Exploitation based on current Q-values
        double maxQValue = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < NUM_ACTIONS; i++) {
            if (qValues[carPosition][i] > maxQValue) {
                maxQValue = qValues[carPosition][i];
                velocityChange = ACTION_SET[i];
            }
        }
    }

    carVelocity += velocityChange;
    updateReward(carPosition, carVelocity); // Apply reward for current state and action
}
```
