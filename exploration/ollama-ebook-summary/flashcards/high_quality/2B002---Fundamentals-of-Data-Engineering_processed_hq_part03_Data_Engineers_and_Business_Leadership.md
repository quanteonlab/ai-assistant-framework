- Storage: Data storage and management.
- Ingestion: Data ingestion processes.
- Transformation: Data processing and transformation.
- Serving data: Making data available for analysis and consumption.

#### Communication with Source System Owners
Background context: Data engineers need to communicate effectively with the owners of source systems to prevent disruptions in the data pipeline. This involves understanding the impact of any changes and maintaining a dialogue about potential issues.
:p What is the importance of communication with source system owners?
??x
The importance of communication with source system owners lies in preventing disruptions to the data pipeline. Data engineers must:
- Understand how changes in the source system could affect the data flow or analytics pipelines.
- Maintain an open line of communication with source system owners to discuss and address any potential issues.

This ensures that modifications to the source systems do not negatively impact downstream processes.
