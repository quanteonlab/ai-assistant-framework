#### Sexual Harassment and Employment Discrimination

Ruth, a supervisor for Subs & Suds restaurant, tells Tim that he can keep his job if he has sex with her. This situation involves potential sexual harassment under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.

:p Is Ruth's behavior an example of sexual harassment?
??x
Yes, Ruth’s behavior is an example of quid pro quo sexual harassment. Quid pro quo harassment occurs when an employee is subjected to unwelcome sexual advances or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature, and submission to such conduct is explicitly or implicitly made a term or condition of employment. In this case, Tim's job security depends on his sexual relationship with Ruth, which is illegal under Title VII.

#### Discrimination Based on Disability

Koko, who has a disability and is well-qualified for the position at Lively Sales Corporation, was rejected. The company eventually hired someone without a disability. Koko could potentially sue Lively for discrimination based on her disability.

:p Could Koko succeed in a suit against Lively?
??x
Yes, Koko could succeed in a suit against Lively under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which is enforced by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The ADA prohibits employers from discriminating against qualified individuals with disabilities in hiring and other employment practices. In this scenario, Lively’s decision to hire someone without a disability despite Koko's qualifications could be seen as discriminatory.

#### Title VII Violations

(a) Tennington, Inc., has an employment record of hiring only white males despite their employees traveling in seven states. This scenario suggests potential violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.

(b) Novo Films advertises "only African Americans need apply" for extras on a movie set. This also indicates a clear violation of Title VII by explicitly discriminating against non-African American applicants.

:p Discuss whether either action would constitute a violation of Title VII.
??x
Both actions would indeed constitute violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, as amended in 1964. 

(a) Tennington Inc.’s practice of hiring only white males violates Title VII because it discriminates against women and people of color on the basis of race or sex.

(b) Novo Films' advertisement explicitly stating "only African Americans need apply" is a clear case of racial discrimination, which is prohibited by Title VII. The act forbids employers from using discriminatory criteria in hiring practices.

No code example is needed for this explanation.

#### Religious Discrimination

Gina Gomez, a devout Roman Catholic, was denied unpaid leave to go on a pilgrimage by her employer, Sam’s Department Stores, Inc., and subsequently terminated. She feels she has been discriminated against based on her religious beliefs.

:p Can Gina establish a prima facie case of religious discrimination?
??x
Yes, Gina could potentially establish a prima facie case of religious discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. A prima facie case involves four elements: (1) she is a member of a protected class; (2) she was qualified for her job; (3) she suffered an adverse employment action (termination); and (4) there were circumstances that suggest discriminatory treatment.

In this scenario, Gina can argue:
- She is a member of the Catholic religion.
- Her sales performance exceeded $200,000 per year, indicating she was qualified for her position.
- She was terminated from her job after requesting unpaid leave to go on pilgrimage.
- The store’s refusal to grant leave and subsequent termination could indicate religious discrimination since other employees were allowed to take vacations during the same period.

#### Gender-Based Dress Code Discrimination

Burlington Coat Factory Warehouse, Inc., had a dress code that required male salesclerks to wear business attire but female salesclerks to wear smocks. Karen O’Donnell and other female employees were fired for refusing to wear the smock.

:p Is Burlington’s dress code policy discriminatory based on gender?
??x
Yes, Burlington Coat Factory's requirement for female salesclerks to wear smocks while male salesclerks wore business attire is discriminatory based on gender. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits employers from discriminating against employees based on sex, including disparate treatment in terms of clothing requirements.

The policy differentiates between genders by requiring women to wear a smock and men to wear business attire, which can be seen as sex-based discrimination. The fact that all other conditions of employment (salary, hours, benefits) were the same for both genders does not mitigate this discriminatory practice.

No code example is needed for this explanation.

#### Newton's Best Defense (Blanton v. Newton Associates, Inc.)
Background context: The case of Blanton v. Newton Associates, Inc., 593 Fed.Appx. 389 (5th Cir. 2015) involves an employee who claims discrimination based on race under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. The issue revolves around what constitutes a valid defense for an employer in such cases.
:p What is Newton's best defense in this case?
??x
Newton’s best defense would likely be to show that it had a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its actions. For example, if the employer can demonstrate that it followed a set procedure or policy when making employment decisions and that these procedures were consistently applied, it could defend against discrimination claims.
In this case, Newton Associates might argue that they followed their internal policies on handling employee complaints and had legitimate concerns about the employee’s performance.
??x
The answer with detailed explanations:
Newton's best defense would likely be to show that it had a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its actions. For example, if the employer can demonstrate that it followed a set procedure or policy when making employment decisions and that these procedures were consistently applied, it could defend against discrimination claims.

For instance, if Newton Associates could prove that they had a documented process for addressing employee complaints and concerns about performance and that this process was followed in Blanton's case, the employer would have a strong defense. The court might also consider whether the decision to discipline or terminate an employee was based on objective criteria related to job performance rather than discriminatory factors.
??x
```java
// Pseudocode for documenting procedures
public class EmployeeComplaintProcedure {
    public void documentComplaint(Employee employee, String reason) {
        // Document the complaint in a system
        System.out.println("Complaint from " + employee.getName() + ": " + reason);
    }

    public boolean followPolicy(Employee employee, String decision) {
        // Check if the policy was followed for the decision
        return true; // Assume the procedure is followed
    }
}
```

#### Discrimination Based on Disability (Wallace v. County of Stanislaus)
Background context: Wallace v. County of Stanislaus involves an employee who was injured and required work restrictions, leading to his placement on an unpaid leave of absence without consulting supervisors. The case examines whether the employer's actions were motivated by a disability under state law.
:p Could Wallace likely prove the "substantial motivating factor or reason" element?
??x
Wallace could potentially prove that the substantial motivating factor was his disability because the county placed him on an unpaid leave based on incorrect assumptions about his ability to perform essential job functions due to the injury. To meet this burden, Wallace would need to present evidence showing that the decision to put him on leave was influenced by concerns related to his physical limitations.

The answer with detailed explanations:
Wallace could potentially prove that the substantial motivating factor was his disability because the county placed him on an unpaid leave based on incorrect assumptions about his ability to perform essential job functions due to the injury. To meet this burden, Wallace would need to present evidence showing that the decision to put him on leave was influenced by concerns related to his physical limitations.

For example, if Wallace can show that the supervisors who rated his performance highly were consulted before he was placed on unpaid leave and their opinions were disregarded in favor of a mistaken belief about his ability, this could strengthen his case. Additionally, presenting medical records or statements from doctors confirming his limitations might also help.
??x
```java
// Pseudocode for evaluating job performance
public class EmploymentEvaluation {
    public void evaluatePerformance(Employee employee) {
        // Evaluate the employee's performance based on supervisor ratings and medical records
        System.out.println("Evaluating " + employee.getName() + "'s performance.");
        if (supervisorRatings(employee) >= 2.5 && hasMedicalClearance(employee)) {
            System.out.println("Performance is above average, no leave necessary.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Placing on unpaid leave due to concerns about job function capacity.");
        }
    }

    private int supervisorRatings(Employee employee) {
        // Simulate supervisor ratings
        return 2; // Above average rating
    }

    private boolean hasMedicalClearance(Employee employee) {
        // Check if the employee has medical clearance for essential job functions
        return true; // Assume medical clearance is confirmed
    }
}
```

#### Unintentional Discrimination (McLane Co. v. EEOC)
Background context: McLane Company fired Damiana Ochoa after she failed a physical evaluation upon returning from maternity leave, alleging discrimination based on gender under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. The case involves issues around employer compliance with EEOC subpoenas and ethical considerations.
:p On what legal ground might McLane legitimately refuse to comply with the EEOC’s subpoena?
??x
McLane could potentially argue that they have a legal right to protect trade secrets or sensitive employee information, which is protected by state laws such as California’s Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (CMIA). They might also claim that producing this information would violate their employees' privacy rights.
Additionally, McLane could contest the scope of the subpoena if it requests information beyond what is relevant to the discrimination complaint.

The answer with detailed explanations:

They might also claim that producing this information would violate their employees' privacy rights. Additionally, McLane could contest the scope of the subpoena if it requests information beyond what is relevant to the discrimination complaint.

For instance, if the EEOC's request for the names and contact information of all employees who have undergone physical evaluations throughout the company’s national operations is overly broad or unnecessary for determining whether McLane discriminated against Ochoa, McLane might legally refuse compliance.
??x
```java
// Pseudocode for handling EEOC requests
public class EEOCRequestHandler {
    public boolean handleSubpoena(String[] requestedInformation) {
        // Check if the information is relevant to discrimination claims
        List<String> relevantInformation = Arrays.asList(requestedInformation);
        if (relevantInformation.contains("medical history") || relevantInformation.contains("employee performance reviews")) {
            System.out.println("Requesting relevant, protected employee data.");
            return true;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Refusing to comply with an overly broad subpoena.");
            return false;
        }
    }
}
```

#### Unintentional Discrimination (IDDR Approach)
Background context: McLane Company requires physical evaluations for employees in physically demanding jobs, which led to the termination of Damiana Ochoa. The case involves ethical considerations and whether McLane has an obligation to comply with EEOC subpoenas.
:p Using the IDDR approach, consider whether McLane has an ethical duty to comply with the subpoena.
??x
Using the IDDR (Identify, Determine, Develop, Respond) approach, McLane should first identify that there is a potential legal issue and compliance requirement. They need to determine if the subpoena poses risks or benefits for their operations. Developing a strategy that balances privacy concerns with legal obligations could involve seeking legal advice and potentially negotiating the scope of the subpoena. Finally, they must respond in a way that addresses both ethical and practical considerations.
??x
The answer with detailed explanations:
Using the IDDR (Identify, Determine, Develop, Respond) approach, McLane should first identify that there is a potential legal issue and compliance requirement. They need to determine if the subpoena poses risks or benefits for their operations.

1. **Identify**: Recognize the EEOC's request as a significant legal matter.
2. **Determine**: Evaluate whether producing the information could harm employees' privacy while ensuring compliance with anti-discrimination laws.
3. **Develop**: Formulate a strategy that involves seeking legal advice and possibly negotiating the scope of the subpoena to protect sensitive data.
4. **Respond**: Act in a way that balances ethical principles (protecting employee rights) with legal obligations.

For instance, McLane might decide to provide only relevant information while protecting confidential medical records. They could also offer alternative means of compliance that do not breach privacy or confidentiality laws.
??x
```java
// Pseudocode for IDDR approach implementation
public class EthicsCompliance {
    public void iddrApproach(String[] requestedInformation) {
        // Identify the legal issue and determine potential risks/benefits
        if (requestedInformation.contains("medical records")) {
            System.out.println("Identifying privacy concerns related to medical data.");
        }

        // Develop a strategy with legal counsel
        if (!canNegotiateScope()) {
            System.out.println("Developing a response plan that complies while protecting privacy.");
        }

        // Respond in a way that balances ethics and legality
        if (respondsWithinBounds()) {
            System.out.println("Responding appropriately to the EEOC's subpoena.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Refusing to comply with an overly broad request.");
        }
    }

    private boolean canNegotiateScope() {
        // Simulate legal advice on negotiating scope
        return true; // Assume negotiation is possible
    }

    private boolean respondsWithinBounds() {
        // Determine if the response is within acceptable legal bounds
        return true; // Assume response is compliant
    }
}
```

:p What was the Notice of Assessment issued to Purchaser?
??x
The Notice of Assessment (Notice) from the Pennsylvania Department stated that Purchaser was liable for $43,370.49 in unpaid unemployment compensation contributions, interest, and penalties due to Predecessor's sale of 51 percent or more of her assets.

Purchaser was notified by the Department that they were liable under Section 788.3(a) of the Unemployment Compensation Law.
x??

---

#### Legal Requirements for Sale
Background context: According to Pennsylvania Statutes, employers who sell in bulk over 51% of their assets are required to notify the department and provide a certificate showing all contributions paid up to the date of sale.

:p What legal requirements must be met when selling significant business assets?
??x
According to Pennsylvania Statutes Section 788.3(a), every employer who sells in bulk 51 percent or more of their assets, including stock, goods, fixtures, machinery, equipment, buildings, or real estate, must give the department a ten-day notice prior to completing the transfer.

The employer is also required to present the purchaser with a certificate showing that all reports have been filed and contributions, interest, and penalties paid up to the date of the proposed transfer. Failure by the purchaser to require such a certificate makes them liable for any unpaid contributions, interest, and penalties.
x??

---

#### Dispute Resolution

#### Legal Liability for Business Assets

Background context explaining the legal liability of business assets. The bulk sales provision aims to ensure that an employer does not divest themselves of assets without settling outstanding liabilities, either by themselves or by a purchaser.

The provision states that the business's liability for unpaid taxes "follows the assets." This means that when a business transfers its assets (such as through a sale), any outstanding tax debts remain with the new owner. 

:p Why do businesses have to follow the rule of liability following assets?
??x
This rule ensures accountability and prevents evasion of tax obligations. If a business sells its assets, the purchaser must assume responsibility for any unpaid taxes associated with those assets.

In the case provided, Gresh's repayment agreement of $50 per month was deemed insufficient to satisfy the UC (Unemployment Contributions) liability, leading to the purchaser being liable for these unpaid contributions, interest, and penalties.
x??

---

#### Legal Reasoning Questions

Background context explaining that the court agreed with the Department’s interpretation of the bulk sales provision. The purpose is to ensure no employer divests themselves of assets without settling outstanding liabilities.

:p What does the bulk sales provision aim to achieve?
??x
The bulk sales provision aims to prevent employers from avoiding their financial responsibilities by selling off business assets without paying off existing debts, such as unemployment contributions. It ensures that any new owner assumes these obligations.
x??

---

#### Actions for Avoiding Liability

Background context explaining the legal consequences when a purchaser fails to obtain a clearance certificate before purchasing business assets.

:p What action can Gadley take now to avoid suffering the loss of funds required to cover Gresh’s unpaid taxes?

Gadley should obtain a clearance certificate from the Department of Employment before purchasing the assets. This will confirm that there are no outstanding liabilities associated with the business assets being purchased.
x??

---

#### Buyer's Precautions

Background context explaining the importance for buyers to check and clear any potential financial obligations before purchasing business assets.

:p What action should a buyer take before purchasing the assets of a business to avoid liability for the seller’s unpaid taxes?

Chain-style business operations involve franchises that use the franchisor's brand and operate as part of a select network, adhering to prescribed operational procedures and maintaining specific performance levels. Examples include Chipotle Mexican Grill and real estate brokerage firms like Century 21.

```java
public class ChainStyleOperationExample {
    private String franchiseName;
    private String franchisorBrand;
    
    public ChainStyleOperationExample(String franchise, String brand) {
        this.franchiseName = franchise;
        this.franchisorBrand = brand;
    }
    
    public void displayDetails() {
        System.out.println("Franchise: " + franchiseName);
        System.out.println("Branded Under: " + franchisorBrand);
    }
}

ChainStyleOperationExample chipotleExample = new ChainStyleOperationExample("Chipotle Mexican Grill", "Chipotle");
chipotleExample.displayDetails();
```

#### Types of Franchises - Manufacturing Arrangements
Manufacturing franchises involve transmitting the essential ingredients or formula to a franchisee who then markets the product according to specified standards. This is common in soft drink bottling companies like Pepsi-Cola.

:p What are manufacturing arrangements?
??x
In manufacturing arrangements, the franchisor provides the necessary ingredients or formulas for producing a particular product. The franchisee markets this product following the franchisor's standards and quality control procedures. For example, Pepsi-Cola franchises operate under these terms.

```java
public class ManufacturingArrangementExample {
    private String product;
    private String formula;
    
    public ManufacturingArrangementExample(String item, String details) {
        this.product = item;
        this.formula = details;
    }
    
    public void displayDetails() {
        System.out.println("Product: " + product);
        System.out.println("Formula Provided by Franchisor: " + formula);
    }
}

ManufacturingArrangementExample pepsiExample = new ManufacturingArrangementExample("Pepsi-Cola", "Provided formula for bottling");
pepsiExample.displayDetails();
```
