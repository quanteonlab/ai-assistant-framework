# Flashcards: Business-Law_-Text-and-Cases_processed (Part 107)

**Starting Chapter:** 20-2 The Scope of Articles 2 Sales and 2A Leases

---

#### Uniform Commercial Code (UCC)
Background context: In the early years of this nation, sales law varied from state to state, complicating the formation of multistate sales contracts. The National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL) began drafting uniform laws in response to these issues, leading to the creation of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) in 1945.

The UCC aims to simplify and streamline commercial transactions by providing a consistent set of rules across states. It has been adopted as law by all states except Louisiana for Articles 2 and 2A.
:p What is the purpose of the Uniform Commercial Code?
??x
The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) was created to provide a uniform set of laws for commercial transactions, simplifying the process and ensuring consistency across different states. It aims to streamline business operations by reducing legal complexity.
x??

---

#### Adoption of UCC
Background context: The UCC has been adopted as law by all of the states except Louisiana for Articles 2 and 2A.

The CISG (United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods) applies only when a nation has adopted it, similar to how the UCC applies in its adopted states.
:p Which states have not adopted the UCC?
??x
Louisiana is the state that has not fully adopted Articles 2 and 2A of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC).
x??

---

#### Articles of the UCC
Background context: The UCC consists of eleven articles, with Article 1 titled "General Provisions," which sets forth definitions and general principles applicable to commercial transactions. This article provides foundational ground for the remaining articles.

Article 2 deals with sales of goods, while Article 2A covers lease transactions.
:p What are the two main areas covered by UCC Articles 2 and 2A?
??x
UCC Article 2 covers the sale of goods, whereas Article 2A addresses lease transactions.
x??

---

#### Good Faith Obligation in UCC
Background context: The UCC includes a good faith obligation for performing all contracts falling under its scope [UCC 1–304]. However, this duty does not apply to contracts that do not fall under the UCC.

In the case of Peter Amaya, his contract with the university was not covered by the UCC since it involved educational services rather than a sale or lease of goods.
:p What is the good faith obligation in the context of the UCC?
??x
The UCC requires parties to perform their contracts "in good faith" [UCC 1–304], meaning they must act honestly and fairly. However, this good faith obligation does not apply to contracts outside the scope of the UCC.
x??

---

#### Revision and Supplementation of UCC
Background context: The UCC is periodically revised or supplemented to address changes in the business environment and clarify certain aspects.

These revisions help ensure that the UCC remains relevant and effective for modern commercial transactions, which often involve global operations.
:p How does the UCC adapt to changing business environments?
??x
The UCC adapts by being periodically revised or supplemented. These updates are aimed at addressing changes in the business environment and providing clearer rules where needed, ensuring the code remains applicable and relevant to current commercial practices.
x??

---

#### Case in Point: Peter Amaya's Breach of Contract Suit
Background context: In a case involving breach of contract and breach of duty of good faith, Peter Amaya was dismissed from Indiana University School of Medicine due to cheating on an exam. He sued the university for these reasons.

The court ruled that since his contract with the university did not involve a sale or lease of goods, the UCC’s good faith obligation did not apply.
:p In what case does the good faith obligation in the UCC not apply?
??x
In the case where Peter Amaya was dismissed from Indiana University School of Medicine, the good faith obligation under the UCC did not apply because his contract with the university involved educational services rather than a sale or lease of goods.
x??

---

#### Finance Lease Obligations Under Article 2A of UCC

Article 2A, distinct from ordinary contract law, mandates that the lessee’s obligations under a finance lease are irrevocable and independent from the financier’s obligations. This means the lessee must continue making lease payments regardless of any defects in the leased equipment.

Example:
- McKessen Company leases surgical ophthalmic equipment to Vasquez for his medical eye center.
- The equipment turns out to be defective, but Vasquez stops making lease payments.
- McKessen sues Vasquez and wins as the lease qualifies as a finance lease under Article 2A. Vasquez is obligated to make all payments due under the lease.

:p What does Article 2A of UCC state about the lessee’s obligations in a finance lease?
??x
Article 2A makes the lessee's obligations under a finance lease irrevocable and independent from the financier's obligations, meaning the lessee must continue making lease payments regardless of any defects or performance issues with the leased equipment.
x??

---

#### Formation of Sales and Lease Contracts

The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) modifies common law contract rules for the formation of sales and lease contracts. The UCC states that an agreement can exist even if the moment it is made is undetermined, as long as there are reasonable terms and a basis to grant a remedy.

:p How does Article 2 of the UCC modify the common law in regard to the formation of sales and lease contracts?
??x
Article 2 of the UCC allows for an agreement to be considered sufficient even if the exact moment it was made is unclear, as long as there are reasonably certain terms and a basis to grant appropriate remedies.
x??

---

#### Formation of Sales and Lease Contracts - Open Terms

Under common law, an offer must specify all essential terms. However, Article 2A of the UCC states that a sales or lease contract will not fail for indefiniteness if one or more terms are left open as long as there is intent to make a contract and a reasonably certain basis for granting a remedy.

:p How does Article 2A of the UCC handle contracts with open terms?
??x
Article 2A of the UCC allows sales or lease contracts to be valid even if one or more terms are left open, provided that there is intent to form a contract and a reasonably certain basis for granting a remedy.
x??

---

#### Determining Contract Existence

The UCC provides numerous provisions that can fill gaps in a contract. An agreement can exist based on evidence such as a purchase order, which indicates the existence of a contract.

:p How does the UCC assist in determining if an open-term contract exists?
??x
The UCC assists by providing numerous provisions to fill gaps in contracts and allowing agreements to be inferred from evidence like purchase orders. If terms are missing, courts can presume reasonable terms under the circumstances.
x??

---

#### Quantity of Goods

In sales and lease contracts, the quantity of goods must usually be expressly stated. This is particularly important as it helps ensure clarity and enforceability.

:p What does the UCC require regarding the quantity of goods in a contract?
??x
The UCC requires that the quantity of goods involved in a sales or lease contract must typically be expressly stated to ensure clarity and enforceability.
x??

---

---
#### Legal Background on Oral Agreements under Illinois Law
Background context: The provided legal document discusses a breach of contract case involving two parties, Kastalon and Toll Processing. Under Illinois law, oral agreements are enforceable if there is an offer, acceptance, and a meeting of the minds as to the terms of the agreement. Moreover, these agreements must be sufficiently definite in their material terms.
:p What legal standard does Illinois use for enforcing oral agreements?
??x
Under Illinois law, oral agreements are enforceable if there is an offer, acceptance, and a mutual understanding of the agreement's terms. The agreement must also be sufficiently definite as to its material aspects.
x??
---

---
#### Dispute Over Duration of Storage Agreement
Background context: Kastalon and Toll Processing had an oral agreement regarding the storage of rolls until Toll Processing issued a purchase order for refurbishment. Toll Processing claimed that Kastalon agreed to store the rolls indefinitely, while Kastalon maintained that the agreement was only for three or four months.
:p What were the conflicting views on the duration of the storage agreement?
??x
Toll Processing argued that Kastalon agreed to store the rolls until a purchase order was issued, potentially indefinitely. In contrast, Kastalon insisted that the agreement was for a short period (three or four months).
x??
---

---
#### Mutual Understanding and Consideration
Background context: The court found that there was no mutual understanding regarding the duration of the storage agreement, as Toll Processing did not know when—or if—it would issue a purchase order. Kastalon argued that its expectation to be hired for repairs constituted consideration.
:p What did Kastalon claim as consideration?
??x
Kastalon claimed that its expectation to be hired by Toll Processing to repair and refurbish the rolls was sufficient consideration for the storage agreement.
x??
---

---
#### District Court's Ruling
Background context: The district court ruled in favor of Kastalon, stating that there was no mutual understanding that Kastalon would store the rolls indefinitely. The duration was contingent on Toll Processing issuing a purchase order within a reasonable timeframe.
:p What did the district court find regarding the storage agreement?
??x
The district court found that the parties did not have a mutual understanding that Kastalon would store the rolls indefinitely. Instead, the duration of the agreement was tied to Toll Processing issuing a purchase order for refurbishment within months.
x??
---

---
#### Appellate Court's Decision
Background context: The appellate court upheld the district court’s ruling on the breach of contract claim, affirming that there was no mutual understanding about indefinite storage and that the duration was based on the issuance of a purchase order by Toll Processing.
:p What did the appellate court decide regarding the appeal?
??x
The appellate court affirmed the judgment of the district court in favor of Kastalon on the breach of contract claim, as the evidence showed that there was no mutual understanding that Kastalon would store the rolls indefinitely. The duration of the agreement was based on Toll Processing issuing a purchase order for refurbishment.
x??

---
#### Prejudgment Interest
Background context: In H. Daya International Co., Ltd. v. Do Denim, LLC (2012 WL 2524729, S.D.N.Y.), the court awarded prejudgment interest based on a New York statute that specifies the rate and start date for accruing this interest.
:p What is prejudgment interest in the context of H. Daya's lawsuit?
??x
Prejudgment interest is an award made by courts to compensate parties for the loss of use of money owed under a contract, starting from the earliest ascertainable date when the cause of action existed. In this case, it started accruing from the receipt of the final shipment as specified by the UCC.
x??

---
#### Delivery Term
Background context: The UCC specifies that if no delivery terms are specified in the sales contract, the buyer normally takes delivery at the seller’s place of business (UCC 2-308(a)). If the seller has no place of business, their residence is used. When goods are located elsewhere and both parties know it, delivery is made there.
:p What happens if a sales contract does not specify the delivery terms?
??x
If a sales contract does not specify the delivery terms, the buyer normally takes delivery at the seller’s place of business (UCC 2-308(a)). If the seller has no place of business, their residence is used. When goods are located elsewhere and both parties know it, delivery is made there.
x??

---
#### Duration of an Ongoing Contract
Background context: A single contract might specify successive performances but not indicate how long the parties are required to deal with each other. In this situation, either party may terminate the ongoing contractual relationship, but principles of good faith and sound commercial practice call for reasonable notification before termination so as to give the other party sufficient time to seek a substitute arrangement.
:p What can happen if an ongoing contract does not specify how long the parties are required to deal with each other?
??x
If an ongoing contract does not specify how long the parties are required to deal with each other, either party may terminate the relationship. However, principles of good faith and sound commercial practice require reasonable notification before termination so as to give the other party sufficient time to seek a substitute arrangement.
x??

---
#### Options and Cooperation with Regard to Performance
Background context: When a sales contract omits terms relating to shipping arrangements, the seller has the right to make these arrangements. The seller must do so in good faith, using commercial reasonableness in the situation (UCC 2-311). If an assortment of goods is not specified, the buyer can specify it.
:p What are a seller's rights and responsibilities regarding shipping arrangements?
??x
When a sales contract omits terms relating to shipping arrangements, the seller has the right to make these arrangements. The seller must do so in good faith, using commercial reasonableness in the situation (UCC 2-311).
x??

---
#### Open Quantity Terms
Background context: Normally, if parties do not specify a quantity in a contract, no contract is formed because it's almost impossible to determine an objectively reasonable quantity. However, there are two exceptions recognized by the UCC in requirements and output contracts (UCC 2-306(1)).
:p What happens when a sales contract does not specify the quantity of goods?
??x
When a sales contract does not specify the quantity of goods, no contract is formed because it's almost impossible to determine an objectively reasonable quantity. However, there are two exceptions recognized by the UCC in requirements and output contracts (UCC 2-306(1)).
x??

---

#### Merchant’s Firm Offer
Background context explaining that a merchant's firm offer is irrevocable for a specified period, unless no definite period is stated and then not exceeding three months. This rule helps ensure that merchants keep their offers open for a certain duration.

:p What defines a merchant's firm offer?
??x
A merchant's firm offer is an irrevocable offer by a merchant to sell goods that remains open during the stated period or, if no definite period is stated, for a reasonable period (not exceeding three months). The offeror cannot revoke it without consent from the offeree. 
```java
// Pseudocode example
if (offerPeriodExceedsThreeMonths) {
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Offer period must not exceed 3 months.");
}
```
x??

---

#### Example of a Merchant’s Firm Offer
Background context providing an example to illustrate how a firm offer is created, emphasizing the importance of specifying a reasonable time frame.

:p What constitutes a merchant's firm offer in the given example?
??x
In the example, Osaka, a used-car dealer, emails Gomez on January 1 stating he will sell a Toyota RAV4 for $22,000 between now and January 31. This e-mail creates a firm offer, ensuring that Osaka cannot sell the car to another person before January 31 without breaching the contract.
```java
// Pseudocode example
public class FirmOffer {
    private String startDate;
    private String endDate;
    
    public boolean isWithinOfferPeriod(String date) {
        return !date.after(endDate);
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Option Contract vs. Merchant’s Firm Offer
Background context explaining the difference between an option contract and a merchant's firm offer, highlighting that if consideration is provided by the offeree, an option contract forms instead.

:p Under what conditions does a merchant's firm offer transform into an option contract?
??x
A merchant's firm offer transforms into an option contract when the offeree provides consideration. In such cases, the offeror and offeree enter into an agreement where the offeree can exercise their rights to buy or sell goods within a specified period for a fee.
```java
// Pseudocode example
public class OptionContract {
    private boolean hasConsideration;
    
    public void createOptionContract() {
        if (hasConsideration) {
            System.out.println("An option contract is formed.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("A merchant's firm offer remains in effect.");
        }
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Requirements for a Firm Offer
Background context outlining the necessary conditions for an offer to qualify as a firm offer, including it must be written or electronically recorded and signed by the offeror.

:p What are the requirements for a firm offer according to the UCC?
??x
For an offer to qualify as a firm offer under the UCC, it must meet two primary conditions:
1. It must be in writing (or electronically recorded) and
2. It must be signed by the offeror.
Additionally, when a firm offer is contained in a form contract prepared by the offeree, the offeror must also sign a separate assurance of the firm offer to ensure awareness.

```java
// Pseudocode example
public class FirmOffer {
    private boolean isWritten;
    private boolean isSignedByOfferor;
    
    public void checkFirmOffer() {
        if (isWritten && isSignedByOfferor) {
            System.out.println("The offer qualifies as a firm offer.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("The offer does not qualify as a firm offer.");
        }
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Acceptance of an Offer
Background context explaining the various ways in which acceptance can be made, including prompt promise to ship or shipment of goods that may or may not conform to the contract.

:p What are the methods of accepting an offer to buy, sell, or lease goods?
??x
Acceptance of an offer under the UCC generally may be made in any reasonable manner and by any reasonable means. Specifically:
- By a prompt promise to ship
- By the prompt shipment of conforming or nonconforming goods

The shipment of nonconforming goods constitutes both acceptance and a breach of contract unless notified as an accommodation.
```java
// Pseudocode example
public class Acceptance {
    private String shipmentType;
    
    public void determineAcceptance() {
        if ("promise to ship".equals(shipmentType)) {
            System.out.println("Acceptance by promise.");
        } else if (checkConformity()) {
            System.out.println("Acceptance by conforming goods.");
        } else if (!isAccommodation()) {
            System.out.println("Breach of contract.");
        }
    }
    
    private boolean checkConformity() {
        // Check for conformity logic
        return true;
    }

    private boolean isAccommodation() {
        // Check for accommodation logic
        return false;
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Example of Acceptance and Breach
Background context providing an example to differentiate between acceptance and breach when nonconforming goods are shipped.

:p How does Halderson's shipment create a contract in the given example?
??x
In the example, if Halderson ships one thousand black smart fitness watches to Mendez without notifying them that these are being sent as an accommodation, this constitutes both an acceptance of the original order and a breach of the resulting contract. 

If Halderson had notified Mendez that the shipment was only offered as an accommodation, then no contract would be formed.
```java
// Pseudocode example
public class AcceptanceBreachExample {
    private String shipmentColor;
    
    public void determineContractStatus() {
        if (shipmentColor.equals("black") && !isAccommodationNotified()) {
            System.out.println("Acceptance and breach of contract.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("No contract formed due to accommodation notification.");
        }
    }
    
    private boolean isAccommodationNotified() {
        // Check if accommodation was notified
        return false;
    }
}
```

#### Forum-Selection Clause Bindingness
The context is a case where National filed a motion to dismiss based on lack of personal jurisdiction due to an alleged non-binding forum-selection clause. The court found that without explicit consent, the clause was not binding. 
:p What is Mahendra’s best argument that the forum-selection clause was, in fact, binding on National?
??x
Mahendra's best argument would be to show that even though the president did not sign the terms and conditions, there were other forms of implicit or implied consent that made the clause binding. For instance, if National regularly used these memorandums for similar transactions without objections, it could imply acceptance. Additionally, Mahendra might argue that any negotiations or dealings with National should be considered as a form of agreement to the terms, including the forum-selection clause.
x??
---
#### UCC 2-207 Application
The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) section 2-207(2) addresses situations where additional terms are included in forms used by merchants. It states that these terms are considered proposals for addition to the contract and only become part of it if they do not materially alter it.
:p How does UCC 2-207(2) apply to the forum-selection clause in this case?
??x
UCC 2-207(2) applies by indicating that the forum-selection clause, being an additional term, must be considered a proposal for addition to the contract. For it to become binding, the alteration must not be material. In this case, since National did not sign or affirmatively express consent, and there was no evidence of implicit acceptance through regular business practices, the court found that the forum-selection clause materially altered the agreements.
x??
---
#### Personal Jurisdiction
The lower court's decision hinged on whether National had sufficient contacts with New York to be subject to personal jurisdiction. The court found insufficient direct contact but allowed for alternative grounds based on specific scenarios.
:p Why did the state intermediate appellate court reverse the dismissal of Mahendra’s complaint regarding personal jurisdiction?
??x
The state intermediate appellate court reversed because it determined that while there was no explicit agreement, National's phone calls with Mahendra created sufficient contacts to subject it to personal jurisdiction under New York's long-arm statute. This means that even though National did not sign or agree in writing, the nature of their communication and business dealings provided a basis for jurisdiction.
x??
---

#### Battle of the Forms
Background context: The term "battle of the forms" refers to situations where a merchant’s acceptance contains terms that add to or conflict with those of an offer. This often occurs when standard forms are used for placing and confirming orders. The UCC tries to eliminate this battle, but differing contract terms still arise in commercial settings.
:p What is the term used to describe the situation where a merchant's acceptance contains terms that add to or even conflict with those of the offer?
??x
The term used to describe this situation is "battle of the forms."
x??

---

#### UCC 2-207(3)
Background context: According to UCC 2-207(3), if a contract's writings do not establish all terms, the court can strike from the contract those terms on which the parties do not agree. This provision is particularly useful in resolving disputes over contract terms.
:p How does the UCC handle situations where the writings of the parties do not fully establish a contract?
??x
The UCC 2-207(3) allows a court to strike from the contract those terms on which the parties do not agree. This means that the terms of the particular contract will consist of those terms on which the writings of the parties agree, together with any supplementary terms incorporated under other provisions.
x??

---

#### Example 20.18
Background context: The example involves SMT Marketing placing an order over the phone with Brigg Sales, Inc., and then receiving an acknowledgment form confirming the order. Despite the lack of a fully established contract in writing, there is no question that a contract exists due to SMT accepting and paying for the goods.
:p In this scenario, how does UCC 2-207(3) help resolve any disputes over contract terms?
??x
UCC 2-207(3) helps by allowing the court to simply strike from the contract those terms on which the parties do not agree. This means that if a dispute arises over the terms, such as the extent of warranties, the court can disregard the disputed terms and consider only those agreed upon.
x??

---

#### Consideration in Contract Modification
Background context: The common law rule requires consideration for every contract modification, but the UCC does not require new consideration. Under UCC 2-209(1), an agreement modifying a contract needs no further consideration to be binding. However, any modification must be made in good faith.
:p Does the UCC require new consideration for modifying a sales or lease contract?
??x
No, the UCC does not require new consideration for modifying a sales or lease contract. According to UCC 2-209(1), an agreement modifying such contracts "needs no consideration to be binding." However, any modification must still be made in good faith.
x??

---

#### Writing Requirement for Contract Modifications
Background context: While the UCC does not require new consideration for contract modifications, certain situations may require a writing. For instance, if the contract itself specifies that changes must be in a signed writing, only those agreed to in such a writing are enforceable. Additionally, some agreements involving consumers might require separate acknowledgment of clauses prohibiting oral modification.
:p Under what circumstances does a contract modification need to be in writing according to UCC 2-209(2)?
??x
A contract modification needs to be in writing if the original contract specifies that any changes must be in a signed writing. Additionally, for agreements involving consumers (nonmerchants), the consumer must sign a separate acknowledgment of clauses prohibiting oral modifications for them to be enforceable.
x??

---

#### Statute of Frauds for Sales and Lease Contracts
Background context: The UCC contains provisions similar to the Statute of Frauds that require sales contracts for goods priced at $500 or more and lease contracts requiring total payments of$1,000 or more to be in writing. These written agreements are enforceable.
:p What does the UCC's Statute of Frauds provision cover?
??x
The UCC's Statute of Frauds provisions cover sales contracts for goods priced at $500 or more and lease contracts requiring total payments of$1,000 or more. These agreements must be in writing to be enforceable.
x??

---

---
#### Admissions Exception
Background context: An oral contract for the sale or lease of goods is enforceable if the party against whom enforcement is sought admits in pleadings, testimony, or other court proceedings that a sales or lease contract was made. The quantity admitted will limit the enforceability to that amount.
:p What is required for an oral agreement on the sale or lease of goods to be enforceable under the admissions exception?
??x
For an oral agreement on the sale or lease of goods to be enforceable under the admissions exception, the party against whom enforcement is sought must admit in pleadings, testimony, or other court proceedings that a sales or lease contract was made. The enforceability will be limited to the quantity admitted.
x??
---

---
#### Partial Performance Exception
Background context: An oral contract for the sale or lease of goods can be enforced if payment has been made and accepted or goods have been received and accepted, which is known as partial performance. This exception allows enforcement at least to the extent that performance actually took place.
:p What must occur for an oral agreement on the sale or lease of goods to be enforceable under the partial performance exception?
??x
For an oral agreement on the sale or lease of goods to be enforceable under the partial performance exception, payment must have been made and accepted, or goods must have been received and accepted. The contract will be enforced at least to the extent that performance actually took place.
x??
---

---
#### Comparison between Contract Law and Sales Law
Background context: This section outlines key differences between general contract law and sales law, particularly regarding contract terms. It specifies that while a written contract with all material terms is required under general contract law, sales contracts must specify the quantity of goods and cannot be enforced beyond this amount.
:p How does the requirement for specifying terms in sales contracts differ from that in general contracts?
??x
In sales law, a contract must contain all material terms, including the specific quantity of goods. If these terms are open (e.g., "reasonable quantities"), the contract is not enforceable beyond the specified quantity term. In contrast, under general contract law, additional terms may be acceptable if the parties intended to form a contract, but the quantity term must still be clearly stated and cannot exceed the agreed-upon amount.
x??
---

---
#### Usage of Trade
Background context: In business transactions, certain practices and methods are regularly observed across a particular trade or vocation. These practices are known as usages of trade and can influence contract interpretations. The UCC (Uniform Commercial Code) recognizes these usages through sections such as 1-303(c).
:p What is an example of a usage of trade in the context provided?
??x
A common practice in the title search industry where Fleet Title Review Company uses "Liability limited to amount of fee" in their invoices. This statement reflects a standard practice that limits liability, which would likely be upheld if Phat Khat sues Fleet for breach of contract.
x??

---
#### Course of Performance
Background context: The course of performance refers to the conduct and dealings between parties under an agreement. It can provide insight into what was agreed upon or implied in the terms of a contract. UCC 1-303(a) defines it as the actual practice that occurs under the terms of an agreement.
:p What does the course of performance indicate according to the provided example?
??x
The course of performance shows that Lopez, without objection, accepted three deliveries from Janson’s Lumber Company even though the lumber did not measure exactly 2 inches by 4 inches. This acceptance suggests that "two-by-four" could be interpreted as a 1 7/8 inch by 3 3/4 inch piece of wood.
x??

---
#### Course of Dealing
Background context: The course of dealing refers to the pattern of conduct between parties in similar transactions over time, which can influence contract interpretation. UCC 2-207(1) and 2A-207(1) recognize this concept as relevant for interpreting contracts.
:p How does Janson’s Lumber Company prove that two-by-fours need not be exactly 2 inches by 4 inches?
??x
Janson’s can show through past transactions with Lopez that they have consistently accepted and used lumber measuring 1 7/8 inches by 3 3/4 inches, thus establishing a course of dealing where the precise dimensions are not critical.
x??

---
#### Usage of Trade vs. Course of Dealing
Background context: Both usage of trade and course of dealing can be used to interpret contract terms, especially when there is ambiguity or missing information in the written agreement. They help fill gaps by providing industry standards and historical practices.
:p How does Janson’s Lumber Company prove that two-by-fours commonly measure 1 7/8 inches by 3 3/4 inches?
??x
Janson’s can demonstrate through previous transactions within the lumber trade that two-by-fours are often measured as 1 7/8 inches by 3 3/4 inches, thus establishing a usage of trade that supports their interpretation.
x??

---
#### Rules of Construction
Background context: The UCC provides guidelines for interpreting contracts. These rules prioritize express terms over implied terms and usages of trade or course of dealing when there is ambiguity in the contract language.
:p What is the order of priority for interpreting ambiguous contract terms according to UCC 1-303(e), 2-208(2), and 2A-207(2)?
??x
The order of priority, from highest to lowest, is: 
1. Express terms (the written agreement)
2. Usage of trade or course of dealing if reasonable to do so
3. If the usage of trade or course of dealing is unreasonable, then consider other relevant external evidence.
x??

#### Concept of Unconscionability in Sales Contracts

**Background context explaining the concept:** This concept deals with whether a sales contract can be deemed unconscionable based on factors such as pricing disparity, credit charges, and the financial resources of the buyer. The case highlights that the sale of a freezer unit for an exorbitant price compared to its retail value might be considered unconscionable if it was known that the buyers had limited financial means.

Mathematically, a significant disparity between the retail value and the actual selling price can indicate unconscionability.
:p How does the mathematical disparity play into determining whether a contract is unconscionable?
??x
The mathematical disparity indicates that the sale of the freezer unit for $900 (including credit charges and sales tax) when its retail value was only$300 could be seen as unconscionable. The credit charges alone exceed the retail value, highlighting an imbalance.
x??

---

#### Financial Resources of Purchasers

**Background context explaining the concept:** The financial resources of the buyer are a crucial factor in determining unconscionability. If it is known that the buyer has limited funds, this can support a finding of unconscionability even if the price seems high on its face.

:p How does knowledge of the buyer's financial situation impact the determination of unconscionability?
??x
Knowledge of the buyer's limited resources supports a finding of unconscionability because it suggests that the seller took advantage of the buyer’s vulnerability. The disparity in value and the excessive credit charges indicate an imbalance not based on fair negotiation but rather exploitation.
x??
