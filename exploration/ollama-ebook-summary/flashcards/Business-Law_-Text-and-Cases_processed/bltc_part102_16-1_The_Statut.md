#### Case in Point 16.13
In this case, Howard and Eleanor Windows sued Erie Insurance Exchange for breach of contract after their home experienced raw sewage damage from the city’s sewer system. The insurance policy excluded coverage for "water or sewage which backs up through sewers and drains." However, the court ruled that the agreement was void and unenforceable under the statute of frauds because Moore's compensation agreement did not sufficiently describe the leases subject to the agreement.

:p What does this case illustrate?
??x
This case illustrates how a court may rule an agreement void and unenforceable if it fails to meet specific legal requirements, such as being in writing for certain types of contracts under the statute of frauds. In this instance, Moore's compensation agreement did not adequately describe the leases, leading to its invalidation.
