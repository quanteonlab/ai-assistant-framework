**Starting Chapter:** 25-1 Types of Negotiable Instruments

---

---
#### Demand Instruments and Checks
Background context explaining demand instruments, their definition under UCC 3–108(a), and how checks fit into this category. 
Checks are a specific type of negotiable instrument that must be payable on demand by their nature.

:p What is a demand instrument?
??x A demand instrument is an instrument that is payable immediately after it is issued and for a reasonable period of time thereafter.
x??

---
#### Time Instruments
Explanation of what makes a time instrument, distinguishing it from a demand instrument. 
Time instruments are those that specify a future date of payment.

:p What distinguishes a time instrument from a demand instrument?
??x A time instrument is payable at a future date, as opposed to a demand instrument which must be paid immediately upon issuance.
x??

---
#### Drafts and Checks
Details on what a draft is, its three parties (drawer, drawee, payee), and how checks are considered drafts under this definition.

:p What is the definition of a draft?
??x A draft is an unconditional written order that involves three parties: the drawer (who creates the draft), the drawee (to whom the payment is directed), and the payee (who receives the payment).
x??

---
#### Types of Negotiable Instruments
Explanation of UCC's classification of negotiable instruments into drafts, checks, notes, and certificates of deposit.

:p What are the four types of negotiable instruments as defined by UCC?
??x The four types are drafts, checks, notes, and certificates of deposit (CDs).
x??

---
#### Orders to Pay vs. Promises to Pay
Explanation of the distinction between orders to pay (drafts and checks) and promises to pay (notes and CDs).

:p How do orders to pay differ from promises to pay?
??x Orders to pay involve an immediate or future payment order, whereas promises to pay are agreements by one party to pay a sum to another at a future date.
x??

---
#### Function of Negotiable Instruments
Explanation of how negotiable instruments function as either cash substitutes or credit devices and their importance in commercial transactions.

:p How do negotiable instruments serve businesses?
??x Negotiable instruments act as both cash substitutes, facilitating immediate payment, and credit devices, extending payment terms. They are essential for many commercial transactions.
x??

---
#### Transferability of Negotiable Instruments
Explanation on why the transferability of these instruments without risk of uncollectibility is crucial.

:p Why must negotiable instruments be easily transferable?
??x To operate effectively as either cash substitutes or credit devices, negotiable instruments need to be transferrable without risking uncollectibility, ensuring their practical utility.
x??

---
#### UCC and Negotiable Instruments
Explanation on the role of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) in defining and regulating these instruments.

:p What is the significance of the UCC in relation to negotiable instruments?
??x The UCC provides a legal framework for defining, regulating, and ensuring the transferability of negotiable instruments.
x??

---

---
#### Certificates of Deposit (CDs)
A certificate of deposit (CD) is a type of note issued by a bank when a party deposits funds, promising to repay the amount with interest on a specific date. The bank acts as the maker, and the depositor as the payee.
:p What are CDs?
??x
Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are financial instruments issued by banks when a party deposits funds, with a promise to return the principal plus interest at a future date. The bank is the issuer or "maker," while the depositor is the recipient or "payee."
x??

---
#### Example 25.5
On February 15, Sara Levin deposits $5,000 with First National Bank of Whiteacre. The bank promises to repay the amount plus 1.85 percent annual interest on August 15.
:p What does this example illustrate?
??x
This example illustrates a typical certificate of deposit (CD). Sara Levin deposits funds ($5,000) with a bank, and in return, the bank agrees to pay back the principal along with agreed-upon interest by a specific date (August 15).

#### Requirements for Negotiability
For an instrument to be negotiable, it must meet certain conditions:
- Be in writing.
- Be signed by the maker or drawer.
- Be an unconditional promise or order to pay.
- State a fixed amount of money.
- Be payable on demand or at a definite time.
- Be payable to order or to bearer.
:p What are the requirements for negotiability?
??x
The requirements for negotiability include:
1. The instrument must be in written form (but may be evidenced by electronic record).
2. It must be signed by the maker or drawer.
3. It must be an unconditional promise or order to pay.
4. It must state a fixed amount of money.
5. It must be payable on demand or at a definite time.
6. It must be payable to order or to bearer.
x??

---
#### Written Form
Negotiable instruments must be in written form (but may be evidenced by electronic record) [UCC 3–103(a)(6), (9)]. However, the UCC allows considerable leeway regarding what can be considered a negotiable instrument.
:p What does this section discuss?
??x
This section discusses the requirement that negotiable instruments must be in written form. While the writing needs to be on material that lends itself to permanence, the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) provides flexibility regarding acceptable forms of writing. Instruments can even be written on unconventional materials like napkins or tablecloths.
x??

---
#### Example 25.6
Checks and notes have been written on various unconventional items such as napkins, menus, tablecloths, shirts, etc., yet courts typically enforce these instruments.
:p What does this example illustrate?
??x
This example illustrates that negotiable instruments need not be written on traditional paper; they can be written on a wide variety of materials. Courts generally recognize and enforce such unconventional writing methods as long as the intent is clear.
x??

---
#### Example 25.7
An instrument must be portable to qualify as negotiable, meaning it should be movable and capable of being transferred freely.
:p What does this example highlight?
??x
This example highlights that for an instrument to be considered negotiable, it must be portable or movable, facilitating its transferability as a substitute for cash. An instrument cannot meet the criteria if it is not readily transportable.
x??

---
#### Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA)
Under UETA, electronic records may suffice as negotiable instruments [UETA Section 16]. A few states have adopted amendments to Article 3 explicitly allowing electronic negotiable instruments.
:p What does this section cover?
??x
This section covers the application of the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA), which permits electronic records to serve as negotiable instruments. Some states have further amended Article 3 of the UCC to specifically authorize the use of electronic negotiable instruments.
x??

---

#### Unconditional Promises or Orders
Background context: According to UCC 3–104(a), only unconditional promises or orders can be negotiable. A promise or order is considered conditional and thus not negotiable if it includes certain conditions, as outlined by the UCC.

:p What defines a negotiable instrument under the UCC?
??x
A negotiable instrument is defined as an unconditional promise or order to pay a fixed amount of money that can be transferred from one party to another. The key point here is "unconditionality," meaning no conditions should exist that would make the payment contingent on something other than the promise itself.
??x

---

#### Express Condition to Payment
Background context: An instrument is not negotiable if it states an express condition to payment, such as requiring fulfillment of a specific event or action.

:p What renders a promissory note nonnegotiable under UCC 3–104(a)?
??x
An express condition to payment. This means the note should not state that payment is contingent on something other than the promise itself.
??x

---

#### Subject to Another Writing
Background context: An instrument is conditional and thus not negotiable if it states that the promise or order is subject to or governed by another writing.

:p How can a statement in an instrument render it nonnegotiable?
??x
If the instrument includes language stating that the rights or obligations are stated in another writing, this can make the instrument nonnegotiable. However, a mere reference does not automatically render it so.
??x

---

#### Reference to Another Writing (UCC 3–106(a))
Background context: A promise or order is not made conditional merely by referencing another document, as long as no express condition or other restrictions are imposed.

:p When can a reference to another writing in an instrument not affect its negotiability?
??x
A mere reference to another writing does not render the promise or order nonnegotiable. Phrases like "as per contract" or statements of origin do not make the document conditional.
??x

---

#### Conditional Promise Based on Future Fund (UCC 3–106(b)(ii))
Background context: An instrument is considered conditional and thus nonnegotiable if payment is to be made from a fund that does not yet exist or is conditioned on future events.

:p What makes an instrument nonnegotiable according to UCC 3–106(b)?
??x
An instrument is nonnegotiable if the payment is contingent upon a fund that has not been established or a condition that must be met in the future.
??x

---

#### Case Study: Alpacas of America, LLC v. Groome
Background context: In this case, the Groomes signed notes to finance their purchases from AOA, which referred back to contracts and other writings. The court ruled that these references did not make the instruments nonnegotiable.

:p How did the court rule on the negotiability of the Groomes' promissory notes?
??x
The court ruled that even though the notes referenced other documents, they contained unconditional promises to pay, making them negotiable.
??x

---

#### Conditional Promise Based on Future Fund (Example)
Background context: This example shows a conditional promise based on establishing a fund in the future.

:p Is the following promissory note negotiable?
Duffy’s note promises to pay Sherman from the trust account that Duffy will establish when he receives the proceeds from his father's estate.
??x
No, this note is nonnegotiable because payment is contingent on an event (establishing a trust account with specific funds) that has not yet occurred.
??x

---

#### Mortgage Note and Its Impact on Negotiability
Background context: In OneWest Bank v. Nunez, the defendants argued that the promissory note was not negotiable because it referred to a mortgage, which included additional terms.

:p Did the reference to a mortgage in the promissory note make it nonnegotiable?
??x
No, the court ruled that although the note referenced the mortgage, this did not render the note nonnegotiable if the promise itself was unconditional.
??x

---
#### Fixed Amount Payable in Money
Background context: Under UCC 3–104(a), a fixed amount must be payable in money. The UCC defines "money" as a medium of exchange authorized or adopted by a domestic or foreign government as part of its currency [UCC 1–201(24)]. Gold is not considered a medium of exchange authorized by the U.S. government, making notes payable in gold nonnegotiable.
If applicable, add code examples with explanations:
:p How does the definition of "money" under the UCC affect negotiability?
??x
The definition of "money" as a medium of exchange authorized or adopted by a domestic or foreign government as part of its currency means that notes payable in gold are nonnegotiable since gold is not officially recognized as money.
```java
// Example to illustrate the concept (pseudocode)
public class Note {
    private String payee;
    private double amount;

    public Note(String payee, double amount) {
        this.payee = payee;
        this.amount = amount; // This must be a fixed amount in U.S. currency for negotiability
    }
}
```
x??

---
#### Negotiable Instruments Payable on Demand or at Definite Time
Background context: A negotiable instrument must be payable on demand or at a definite time [UCC 3–104(a)(2)]. This requirement ensures that the value and obligations of the instrument can be clearly determined. For instance, instruments with words like "Payable at sight" or "Payable upon presentment" are considered payable on demand.
:p What does it mean for an instrument to be "payable on demand"?
??x
An instrument is "payable on demand" if it contains the words "Payable at sight" or "Payable upon presentment," indicating that payment can be made immediately when presented. This means the maker, drawee, or acceptor must pay upon demand.
```java
// Example to illustrate the concept (pseudocode)
public class Check {
    private String payer;
    private double amount;

    public Check(String payer, double amount) {
        this.payer = payer;
        this.amount = amount; // This check is payable on demand
    }
}
```
x??

---
#### Presentment of Instruments
Background context: Presentment occurs when a demand to either pay or accept an instrument is made by or on behalf of a person entitled to enforce the instrument [UCC 3–501]. Essentially, it involves bringing the instrument to the appropriate party for payment or acceptance. The nature of some instruments may indicate that they are payable on demand, such as checks.
:p What triggers presentment?
??x
Presentment is triggered when a person brings an instrument to the appropriate party for payment or acceptance in response to a demand. This can be explicitly stated in the wording of the instrument or implied by its nature, like with checks which are defined as payable on demand [UCC 3–104(f)].
```java
// Example to illustrate presentment (pseudocode)
public class PaymentRequest {
    private String payee;
    private double amount;

    public void requestPayment(String payee, double amount) {
        // This method simulates the act of requesting payment through a demand
        this.payee = payee;
        this.amount = amount; // Triggering presentment by making a demand for payment
    }
}
```
x??

---
#### Statute of Limitations and Negotiability
Background context: The nature of negotiability affects the statute of limitations for filing an action on a note. A nonnegotiable instrument, like one not stating a fixed amount on its face, may fall under a different statute of limitations compared to a negotiable instrument.
:p How does negotiability affect the statute of limitations?
??x
Negotiability affects the statute of limitations because it determines which statutory period applies. For example, if an instrument is nonnegotiable due to not stating a fixed amount on its face, the court may apply a different statute of limitations than that for negotiable instruments. In Alta Logistics case, since the note was not negotiable, UCC Article 3's six-year statute did not apply; instead, it had to be treated as a breach-of-contract claim with a four-year limitation period.
```java
// Example to illustrate statute of limitations (pseudocode)
public class LegalAction {
    private String party;
    private double amountDue;

    public void fileLegalAction(String party, double amountDue) {
        // This method simulates filing an action based on the statute of limitations applicable to negotiable instruments or contracts
        this.party = party;
        this.amountDue = amountDue; // Determining whether the note is negotiable and applying the correct statute of limitations
    }
}
```

#### Maker or Drawer Agreement
Background context: The maker or drawer of a negotiable instrument agrees to pay either the person specified on the instrument or whomever that person might designate. This agreement keeps the instrument transferable.

:p What does the maker or drawer agree to when creating a negotiable instrument?
??x
The maker or drawer agrees to make payment either to the specific person named on the instrument or to any person designated by that person. This makes the instrument transferable, allowing it to be passed from one party to another.
x??

---

#### Order Instruments
Background context: An order instrument is specified to a particular individual who can then designate someone else as the payee. The instrument remains negotiable if it clearly identifies the payee.

:p What type of instruments are "Pay to James Yung or order"?
??x
These are examples of order instruments, which indicate that payment will be made to James Yung or whomever he designates. Such instruments retain their negotiability.
x??

---

#### Bearer Instruments
Background context: A bearer instrument does not designate a specific payee; instead, it can be transferred by the person in possession without an indorsement.

:p Define "bearer" in the context of negotiable instruments?
??x
In the context of negotiable instruments, "bearer" refers to someone who holds an instrument that is payable to bearer or has been indorsed in blank. This means the maker agrees to pay anyone who presents the instrument for payment.
x??

---

#### Nonexistent Payee
Background context: An instrument can be a bearer instrument if it indicates no specific person to whom payment is due, making it payable to "bearer."

:p Can an instrument be negotiable if it states "payable to Captain America"?
??x
Yes, such an instrument would be negotiable as a bearer instrument because it clearly indicates that the payment is intended for a nonexistent individual. This means anyone in possession of the document can present it for payment.
x??

---

#### Nonexistent Organization
Background context: An instrument cannot be payable to a nonexistent organization and still qualify as a negotiable instrument.

:p Can an instrument stating "payable to the order of the Camrod Company" be negotiable if no such company exists?
??x
No, an instrument stating “payable to the order of the Camrod Company” would not be a negotiable instrument because there is no existing organization named Camrod Company. Such an instrument does not meet the criteria for being considered negotiable.
x??

---

#### Ambiguities and Omissions
Background context: Certain ambiguities or omissions do not affect the negotiability of an instrument, meaning that these issues can be resolved without invalidating the document.

:p What types of ambiguities or omissions will not affect the negotiability of a negotiable instrument?
??x
Certain ambiguities or omissions in the language or content of a negotiable instrument will not affect its negotiability. These include minor errors or unclear phrases that do not fundamentally alter the nature of the payment obligation.
