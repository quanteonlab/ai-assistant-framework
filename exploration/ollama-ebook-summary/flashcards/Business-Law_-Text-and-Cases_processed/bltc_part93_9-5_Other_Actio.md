**Starting Chapter:** 9-5 Other Actions Involving Online Posts

---

#### Stored Communications of Retired Police Officers and Firefighters
Background context: The government suspected that 381 retired police officers and firefighters had faked illness after 9/11 to obtain disability benefits. Facebook was issued warrants to provide stored communications data, which were challenged in court for being overly broad.
:p What legal challenge did Facebook face regarding the warrants?
??x
Facebook faced a constitutional challenge because the warrants were deemed overly broad by the court. The government sought access to digital data related to these individuals.
The court ruled that although the warrants were unconstitutional, they had to be followed due to a lack of specific challenges from the users themselves.
```java
// Pseudocode for understanding legal challenges in this context
public class LegalChallenge {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String warrant = "Access to digital data of retired police officers and firefighters.";
        if (!isSpecificChallengeFromUsers(warrant)) {
            System.out.println("Warrants must be followed due to lack of specific challenge.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Warrants can be challenged further in court by users.");
        }
    }

    private static boolean isSpecificChallengeFromUsers(String warrant) {
        // Logic for checking if a specific challenge was made
        return false; // Placeholder logic, usually checks user responses or actions
    }
}
```

#### Protection of Social Media Passwords
Background context: States have enacted laws to protect individuals from being forced to disclose their social media passwords. These laws can prevent employers or schools from taking adverse actions based on content found in these accounts.
:p What legal protection do states provide regarding social media password disclosures?
??x
States provide legal protections that prohibit employers and schools from requiring the disclosure of social media passwords. Michigan, for example, bans adverse action against employees or applicants based on their online postings, including those made years earlier or out of context.

This legislation aims to prevent discrimination based on social media content but does not completely eliminate the possibility of such actions occurring.
```java
// Pseudocode illustrating how states might enforce protections against password disclosure
public class SocialMediaProtection {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String passwordDisclosure = "An employer requests a job applicant's Facebook password.";
        if (isProtectedState()) {
            System.out.println("Password is protected; cannot be disclosed.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("No legal protection for password disclosure in this state.");
        }
    }

    private static boolean isProtectedState() {
        // Logic to determine if the current state enforces such protections
        return true; // Placeholder logic, usually checks state-specific laws
    }
}
```

#### Company-wide Social Media Networks
Background context: Many companies create internal social media networks for their employees. These intranets are used for business-related communications and are generally more professional in tone compared to external platforms like Facebook.
:p What is the purpose of company-wide social media networks?
??x
The primary purpose of company-wide social media networks, such as Dell Inc.'s internal systems or Salesforce.com’s Chatter, is to facilitate internal communication related to work. These networks allow employees to exchange messages about topics such as deals, new products, production issues, and customer orders.

These platforms are designed to be more business-like in tone, ensuring a professional environment for workplace communications.
```java
// Pseudocode illustrating the use of company-wide social media networks
public class CompanyIntranet {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String message = "Team solved a critical issue with a new product.";
        postMessage(message); // Method to post messages on the intranet

        if (isBusinesslikeTone()) {
            System.out.println("Message posted in a professional, business-like tone.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Message did not follow the expected business-like tone.");
        }
    }

    private static void postMessage(String message) {
        // Logic to post messages on the internal social media network
    }

    private static boolean isBusinesslikeTone() {
        // Logic to check if the message follows a professional, business-like tone
        return true; // Placeholder logic
    }
}
```

#### Legal Liability of ISPs for Defamatory Content
Background context: Internet service providers (ISPs) are often involved in legal disputes over defamatory content posted by their users. Traditionally, publishers like newspapers and magazines could be held liable for publishing defamatory statements created by others. The question arises whether ISPs should also bear this liability.

The Communications Decency Act (CDA), specifically section 230 of the U.S. Code, provides a defense for ISPs regarding third-party content. However, some courts have started to establish limits on this immunity.
:p According to the CDA, how are ISPs generally treated in terms of liability for defamatory messages posted by their users?
??x
Under the Communications Decency Act (CDA), ISPs are typically not liable for publishing defamatory statements that come from a third party. The CDA states: "No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider." However, some courts have begun to set limits on this immunity.

#### Case in Point 9.17: Roommate.com, LLC
Background context: In a specific case involving Roommate.com, an online roommate-matching service, the company was sued for prompting users to disclose discriminatory information, which violated federal law. The question is about how courts determined whether Roommate.com was immune from liability under the CDA.
:p How did the court in Roommate.com's case rule on their immunity claim?
??x
The court ruled that Roommate.com was not immune from liability under the CDA. By creating a website and questionnaire with specific prompts, Roommate.com encouraged users to express discriminatory preferences and then matched users based on these preferences, which violated federal law.

#### Other Legal Actions Involving Online Posts
Background context: Online posts can give rise to various legal actions such as defamation, wrongful interference, or infliction of emotional distress. These actions may be grounded in common law or specific statutes aimed at online communications.
:p What types of legal actions can arise from online posts besides defamation?
??x
Legal actions involving online posts can include wrongful interference and infliction of emotional distress. Additionally, there might be statutory causes of action specifically targeting online communications.

#### Summary of Key Concepts
Background context: This summary covers the liability of ISPs for third-party content, a specific case study, and other legal actions that may arise from online conduct.

- **ISPs vs. Publishers**: ISPS are generally not liable for defamatory messages posted by their users under the CDA.
- **Roommate.com Case**: Courts ruled against Roommate.com's immunity claim due to creating a platform encouraging discriminatory practices.
- **Other Legal Actions**: Online posts can lead to various legal actions such as interference or emotional distress.

These concepts are crucial in understanding how ISPs and online platforms manage legal risks associated with user-generated content.

#### Advertisements and Privacy Concerns
Background context: The provided text discusses a legal case where Facebook was sued for displaying names and profile pictures of users without their consent. This led to a settlement, highlighting privacy issues related to social media advertising.

:p What does this scenario illustrate about the use of personal data in advertisements?
??x
This scenario illustrates that using personal data (such as names and photos) for commercial purposes requires explicit permission from individuals. Without such permission, it can lead to legal actions and settlements, emphasizing the need for clear privacy policies and consent mechanisms.

Example: 
```java
public class PrivacyPolicy {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Simulate checking user consent before displaying their data in ads.
        boolean hasConsent = false;  // Assume no explicit consent is given.
        
        if (hasConsent) {
            System.out.println("Displaying ad with friend's name and picture.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Requesting user consent to display ad with friends' names and pictures.");
        }
    }
}
```

#### Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Privacy Policies
Background context: The FTC investigates privacy violations and has forced several companies, including Google, Facebook, and Twitter, into consent decrees. These agreements give the FTC broad powers to review privacy and data practices and allow for legal action against violations.

:p How do consent decrees issued by the FTC impact internet companies?
??x
Consent decrees issued by the FTC provide strict guidelines that internet companies must follow regarding their privacy and data practices. These decrees can significantly limit how companies collect, use, and share user data. Companies violating these terms risk legal action from the FTC.

Example:
```java
public class FTCConsentDecree {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        boolean violation = true;  // Assume a violation has occurred.
        
        if (violation) {
            System.out.println("Filing a lawsuit against the company for violating consent decree.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Company is in compliance with FTC's privacy policies and data practices.");
        }
    }
}
```

#### Google’s Privacy Violation Case
Background context: The text mentions a specific case where Google was sued by the FTC over misuse of data from Safari users. This involved using cookies to track users even when they had blocked such tracking, violating an existing consent decree.

:p What did Google do that violated the FTC's terms?
??x
Google violated the FTC’s terms by misusing data from Apple's Safari users and using cookies to trick the Safari browser on iPhones and iPads. This allowed Google to monitor users who had explicitly blocked such tracking, which was in violation of their prior consent decree.

Example:
```java
public class PrivacyViolation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        boolean blockedTracking = false;  // Assume the user has blocked tracking.
        
        if (blockedTracking && !isTracked()) {
            System.out.println("Misusing data to track users who have blocked such monitoring.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Complying with privacy settings and not tracking users.");
        }
    }
    
    private static boolean isTracked() {
        return true;  // Assume the user was tracked despite blocking.
    }
}
```

#### Joel Gibb’s Copyright Violations
Background context: The scenario involves a student, Joel Gibb, who downloaded copyrighted music and movies from the Internet without permission. He also used portions of these songs in his own recordings.

:p Did Joel Gibb violate any laws by downloading music and videos?
??x
Yes, Joel Gibb violated copyright law by downloading music and videos from unlicensed sources. This is illegal as it does not comply with copyright holder’s rights and can lead to legal action under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).

Example:
```java
public class CopyrightViolation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        boolean isLicensed = false;  // Assume Joel did not have a license.
        
        if (!isLicensed) {
            System.out.println("Downloading copyrighted content without permission violates copyright law.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Downloaded content under proper licensing, no violation of copyright law.");
        }
    }
}
```

#### Use of Copyrighted Content on Social Media
Background context: The scenario explores whether it is legal for individuals to post copyrighted content (like music) on their social media pages.

:p Can individuals legally post copyrighted songs they downloaded from the Internet on Facebook?
??x
No, individuals cannot legally post copyrighted songs they downloaded from the Internet on Facebook or any other social media platform without permission. This action would be a violation of copyright law as it involves distributing unauthorized copies of protected content.

Example:
```java
public class PostingCopyrightedContent {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        boolean hasPermission = false;  // Assume no proper licensing.
        
        if (!hasPermission) {
            System.out.println("Posting copyrighted songs on social media without permission is illegal.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Posted content with proper licensing, no violation of copyright law.");
        }
    }
}
```

#### Boston University’s Request for Password
Background context: The scenario involves an admissions office requesting a student's Facebook password. This raises privacy and security concerns related to personal data.

:p Did Boston University violate any laws when it asked Joel for his Facebook password?
??x
Boston University did not necessarily violate any specific laws by requesting Joel's Facebook password, but such requests can raise privacy concerns. Universities typically have policies that protect students' privacy and may not request passwords without a legitimate educational or security reason.

Example:
```java
public class PasswordRequest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        boolean isLegitimateReason = true;  // Assume the university had a legitimate reason.
        
        if (!isLegitimateReason) {
            System.out.println("Requesting password without proper justification violates privacy laws.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("University request for password was justified and did not violate privacy laws.");
        }
    }
}
```

#### Domain Name Misappropriation
Background context: The scenario involves a case where Karl self-publishes a cookbook using a domain name that mimics existing popular cooking sites to attract more traffic.

:p Has Karl done anything wrong by appropriating other cooking sites' key words in his domain name?
??x
Yes, Karl has potentially done something wrong by appropriating the key words of other cooking and cookbook sites in his domain name. This can be seen as a form of cybersquatting or "typosquatting," which involves registering a domain name that is similar to an existing popular site for commercial gain.

Example:
```java
public class DomainNameMisappropriation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String existingSite = "cookbookrecipes.com";  // Example of an existing cooking site.
        String KarlSite = "holefoods.com";  // Karl's domain name, mimicking the popular one.
        
        if (KarlSite.contains(existingSite)) {
            System.out.println("Misappropriating other sites' key words in domain name may be considered cybersquatting.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Domain name does not contain keywords from existing site; no issue identified.");
        }
    }
}
```

#### Data Security Incident and Legal Implications
Background context: In 2013, Dartmouth College professor M. Eric Johnson, working with Tiversa, a company that monitors peer-to-peer networks for security services, found private medical information on LabMD's network. They informed LabMD about the breach but were instead sued by the latter.
:p What does this scenario indicate about data security and legal implications?
??x
This scenario highlights several important points regarding data security:
1. **Exposure of Sensitive Data**: The incident demonstrates that private information, such as Social Security numbers, insurance details, and treatment codes, can be exposed on peer-to-peer networks.
2. **Legal Responsibilities**: Companies like LabMD have legal responsibilities to secure sensitive data and must respond appropriately when breaches occur.

The court ruling in this case is relevant because it sets a precedent for how companies should handle such incidents. If the court finds that Tiversa had acted within its rights, it could establish guidelines on how third-party security services operate without infringing on company rights.
??x
The court's decision would likely consider whether Tiversa acted ethically and legally in notifying LabMD about the breach before resorting to legal action. If Tiversa's actions were reasonable and aimed at securing private information, they might be protected from liability under certain legal doctrines.

If LabMD had taken steps to secure their data more effectively or respond to the notification, it could have argued that the lawsuit was premature.
??x
```java
// Pseudocode for a simple system to monitor peer-to-peer networks
public class DataMonitor {
    public void notifyCompany(String information) {
        // Logic to inform the company about potential breaches
        System.out.println("Notifying company about potential data breach: " + information);
    }
}
```

#### Authenticating Social Media Evidence in Legal Proceedings
Background context: In United States v. Hassan, the government used social media posts from Facebook as evidence against Mohammad Omar Aly Hassan during his trial for terrorism-related offenses.
:p How could the government authenticate social media postings to prove ownership?
??x
The government can establish authenticity by using several methods:
1. **Metadata Analysis**: Examining metadata such as timestamps, IP addresses, and device information associated with the posts.
2. **Content Corroboration**: Cross-referencing content in multiple contexts or verifying consistency across different platforms.

Legal standards for authentication require a reasonable basis to believe that the evidence is what it purports to be.
??x
```java
// Pseudocode for a method to authenticate social media postings
public boolean authenticateSocialMediaPost(String postContent, String metadata) {
    // Check if the content matches known patterns or user accounts
    // Compare metadata with available data sources (e.g., IP logs)
    return validateMetadata(postContent, metadata);
}

private boolean validateMetadata(String postContent, String metadata) {
    // Logic to verify authenticity based on metadata and content
    // Example: Check timestamps against database entries
    System.out.println("Validating metadata for post: " + postContent);
    return true; // Placeholder logic
}
```
x??

#### Threat Assessment in Social Media Content
Background context: In United States v. Wheeler, Kenneth Wheeler made threatening statements on Facebook that were deemed serious enough to charge him with terrorism-related offenses.
:p Could a reasonable person conclude that Wheeler's social media posts constituted threats?
??x
A reasonable person standard is often used by courts to determine the legality of speech. For statements to be considered true threats, they must meet three criteria:
1. **Explicit Threat**: The statement must express an intention to harm or intimidate.
2. **Imminence**: The threat must be immediate and not hypothetical.
3. **Credibility**: There should be a likelihood that the threat would be carried out.

In this case, Wheeler's statements about killing police officers and children could reasonably be interpreted as threats due to their explicit nature, immediacy (given they were posted online), and potential credibility based on his expressed ideology.
??x
```java
// Pseudocode for evaluating social media posts for threat assessment
public boolean isThreat(String postContent) {
    // Define keywords that indicate a credible threat
    String[] threateningKeywords = {"kill", "massacre", "drown"};
    
    // Check if any threatening keywords are present in the content
    for (String keyword : threateningKeywords) {
        if (postContent.contains(keyword)) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false; // Placeholder logic
}
```

#### Juror Disqualification Due to Social Media Connection
Background context: In a Georgia state court case, during jury selection, the prosecutor learned that "Juror 4" was on the defendant's Facebook page and moved to dismiss her from the jury.
:p How could this situation affect the trial?
??x
This situation could impact the fairness of the trial by potentially influencing juror impartiality. The key issue here is whether "Juror 4"'s connection to the defendant through social media might have affected their ability to remain objective during deliberations.

If a juror has shown bias or potential for prejudice, it would be reasonable to disqualify them to ensure a fair trial.
??x
```java
// Pseudocode for handling juror disqualification in legal proceedings
public void handleJurorDisqualification(String jurorID) {
    // Check if the juror is connected to any party involved in the case on social media
    boolean isConnected = checkSocialMediaConnections(jurorID);
    
    if (isConnected) {
        System.out.println("Replacing Juror " + jurorID + " due to possible bias.");
        replaceJurorWithAlternate();
    } else {
        System.out.println("No disqualification for Juror " + jurorID + ".");
    }
}

private boolean checkSocialMediaConnections(String jurorID) {
    // Logic to determine if the juror is connected to any party on social media
    return true; // Placeholder logic
}
```

#### Classification of Crimes

Criminal offenses are classified based on their severity. Felonies are serious crimes punishable by death or imprisonment for more than one year, while misdemeanors are less serious offenses, typically punishable by a fine or up to a year in jail.

If a crime is severe enough, it can determine the court where the trial will take place and may also affect whether the defendant has the right to a jury trial.

:p How do felonies and misdemeanors differ?
??x
Felonies are serious crimes with punishments including death or imprisonment for more than one year. Misdemeanors are less severe offenses, punishable by fines or up to a year in jail.
x??

---

#### Guilty Act (actus reus)

The guilty act is an essential element of criminal liability. In the context of criminal law, it refers to the prohibited behavior that constitutes the crime.

:p What is considered the guilty act in criminal law?
??x
The guilty act, or actus reus, is the prohibited behavior that makes up a crime and must be present for there to be criminal liability.
x??

---

#### Intent (mens rea)

For a person to be convicted of a crime, not only must they perform an illegal act (actus reus), but their mental state at the time of committing the act must also meet certain criteria. This mental state is referred to as mens rea.

:p What does mens rea mean in criminal law?
??x
Mens rea refers to the specified state of mind or intent on the part of the actor that, when combined with a prohibited act (actus reus), constitutes a crime.
x??

---

#### Commission vs. Omission

Most crimes require an act of commission—that is, a person must do something in order to be accused of a crime. However, some offenses can also result from acts of omission, such as failing to perform a legal duty.

:p Can crimes be committed through omission?
??x
Yes, certain crimes can involve acts of omission when a person fails to perform a legal duty they are required to do, like not filing a tax return.
x??

---

#### Digital Update: Twitter and Epilepsy

An example where a prohibited act is translated into harmful action: Using Twitter to send a flashing video could cause seizures in someone with epilepsy. This illustrates how even seemingly harmless digital actions can have serious consequences.

:p How can using social media platforms like Twitter potentially lead to criminal liability?
??x
Using Twitter to send a flashing video to an epileptic user can trigger seizures, which is considered a harmful act that could result in criminal liability.
x??

---

#### Criminal Law and Jurisdiction

The Model Penal Code issued by the American Law Institute aims to standardize criminal laws across states. However, each state has developed its own set of laws, leading to variations in types of crimes and prescribed punishments.

:p Why do different states have varying laws for criminal offenses?
??x
Different states have their own sets of laws governing criminal acts due to the Model Penal Code not being a uniform code and aiming to standardize laws. This leads to variations in how crimes are classified and punished across jurisdictions.
