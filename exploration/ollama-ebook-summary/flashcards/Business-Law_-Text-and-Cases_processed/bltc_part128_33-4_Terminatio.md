**Starting Chapter:** 33-4 Termination of an Agency

---

---
#### Agency Liability and Terminations
Agency liability refers to a principal's responsibility for an agent's actions, such as violating sanitation rules or regulations. This is similar to contract law where both parties can terminate their relationship through mutual agreement or by operation of law.
:p What are some examples of situations where the principal might be liable for an agent’s actions?
??x
The principal might be held responsible if the agent violates sanitation rules, price regulations, or liquor sales laws. For instance, if an agent sells liquor without a proper license, the principal could face legal penalties.
x??

---
#### Termination by Act of Parties (Revocation and Renunciation)
Agency relationships can end through mutual agreement or unilateral actions by either party. Revocation is when the principal ends the agency relationship, while renunciation occurs when the agent decides to terminate it. Either action needs to be communicated properly to third parties if necessary.
:p How does an agency relationship typically come to an end due to the act of the parties?
??x
An agency can be terminated by mutual agreement or unilateral actions such as revocation (by the principal) or renunciation (by the agent). If termination is unilateral, it must be communicated appropriately to relevant third parties.
x??

---
#### Reasonable Time and Notification Requirements
Once an agency relationship ends, the agent no longer has the authority to bind the principal. However, for the apparent authority of the agent to end, third parties need to be notified if a specific event or time period is involved. The duration can vary depending on the circumstances.
:p What factors determine whether the termination of an agency will affect the apparent authority?
??x
The termination of an agency affects the apparent authority only if third parties are notified. This is necessary when there's a specified event, like the sale of products, or a time period, such as six months from the contract start.
x??

---
#### Wrongful Termination and Legal Consequences
Wrongful termination can occur when one party cancels an agency agreement without proper justification. Such actions could lead to legal disputes and potential lawsuits for breach of contract.
:p Can you explain what constitutes wrongful termination in an agency relationship?
??x
Wrongful termination occurs when either the principal or the agent terminates the agency relationship without valid reason, potentially leading to a lawsuit for breach of contract.
x??

---
#### Case Study: Smart Trike, Ltd. and Piermont Products, LLC
This case illustrates how agencies can be terminated based on mutual agreement or specific conditions outlined in contracts. In this scenario, Smart Trike required six months' notice before termination could take effect.
:p How did the Smart Trike and Piermont Products contract specify agency termination?
??x
The contract between Smart Trike and Piermont Products stipulated that either party must provide six months’ notice before terminating the agency relationship. This ensures a smooth transition for both parties.
x??

---

#### Notice of Termination
When an agency relationship is terminated, it’s important for the principal to notify third parties who are aware of the existence of the agency. This notification can be done through various means and does not require a specific form. The termination does not affect the agent's apparent authority until the third party has received notice.
:p What action must the principal take regarding third parties when terminating an agency?
??x
The principal must inform any third parties who are aware of the existence of the agency that it has been terminated, even though no particular form is required. The notification can be done by personal communication or through other means.
x??

---

#### Apparent Authority Post-Termination
Even after the termination of an agency, an agent’s apparent authority continues until a third party receives notice (from any source) that such authority has been terminated. Actual authority ends upon termination but not for third parties who have no direct knowledge of it.
:p What happens to an agent's actual and apparent authority when the agency is terminated?
??x
An agent's actual authority ceases immediately upon termination, whereas their apparent authority continues until a third party receives notice that such authority has been terminated. Third parties are bound by the actions taken by the agent as long as they remain unaware of the termination.
x??

---

#### Example: Manning and Stone
Manning bids on a shipment of steel, and Stone is hired to arrange transportation for this shipment. When Stone learns that Manning has lost the bid, his authority to make transportation arrangements terminates immediately.
:p What happens to Stone's authority when Manning loses the bid?
??x
Stone’s authority to make transportation arrangements terminates immediately upon learning that Manning has lost the bid. The agency relationship ends with respect to these specific tasks even if Stone does not personally learn of the termination from the principal.
x??

---

#### Notifying Third Parties Directly
If the principal knows a third party has dealt with the agent, they are expected to notify that person directly. For third parties who have heard about the agency but haven't interacted with it yet, constructive notice is sufficient.
:p How should a principal handle notifying third parties of an agency's termination?
??x
A principal must notify third parties directly if they know the party has dealt with the agent. If the third party hasn't engaged in any dealings, the principal can provide them with constructive notice through appropriate means such as publishing a notice or posting it at a designated public place.
x??

---

#### Revocation of Written Authority
If an agent’s authority is written and requires revocation, this must be done in writing unless the document contains an expiration date. This ensures that both parties are formally informed about any changes in their roles.
:p What steps should be taken to revoke an agent's authority if it was granted through a written agreement?
??x
To revoke an agent’s authority under a written agreement, the principal must issue a formal revocation notice in writing unless the document already contains an expiration date. This ensures both parties are officially informed of any changes.
x??

---

#### Termination by Operation of Law - Death or Insanity
An agency relationship automatically terminates if either the principal or the agent dies or becomes insane. The death or insanity does not need to be known for the termination to take effect, though some states may require knowledge in certain circumstances.
:p What causes an automatic and immediate termination of an ordinary agency?
??x
An ordinary agency is automatically and immediately terminated when either the principal or the agent dies or becomes insane. The death or insanity of one party triggers this event without requiring any specific notice to third parties, unless the authority was coupled with an interest that required knowledge.
x??

---

#### Termination by Impossibility - Destruction of Subject Matter
An agency ends if the subject matter is destroyed, such as in a fire, or when it becomes impossible for the agent to perform due to legal changes. For instance, Pedro’s employment of Vasquez to sell his house terminates when the house is destroyed by fire.
:p What event can cause an automatic termination of an agency?
??x
An agency automatically terminates if the specific subject matter is destroyed (e.g., a house burned down) or when it becomes impossible for the agent to perform lawfully due to changes in the law. For example, Pedro’s employment of Vasquez to sell his house would terminate if the house was destroyed by fire.

#### Respondeat Superior Liability for Torts Committed by Agents

In this chapter, we discuss how an employer might be held liable for the tortious acts committed by their employee within the scope of employment. This doctrine is called **respondeat superior**.

The key factor in determining whether Buy-Mart can be held liable under this doctrine involves analyzing if Watts's actions were within the scope of her employment and if Buy-Mart had a duty to supervise or control her, even though she might have acted negligently or intentionally.

If Watts’s behavior was an intentional tort (e.g., battery), then Buy-Mart would likely face more severe liability than in cases of negligence. However, both scenarios involve assessing whether the actions were within the scope of employment and if there was a duty to supervise.

:p Under what doctrine might Buy-Mart be held liable for Watts's tortious act?
??x
Buy-Mart could potentially be held liable under the **respondeat superior** doctrine. This doctrine holds an employer responsible for the torts committed by their employees within the scope of employment. The key is whether Watts’s actions were within her job duties and if Buy-Mart had a duty to supervise her, regardless of whether the act was intentional or negligent.
x??

---
#### Impact of Prior Convictions on Liability

If Watts disclosed in her application that she had been convicted of felony assault and battery, this fact could affect Buy-Mart's liability. The company might argue that they did not have a reasonable expectation of hiring an employee with such a history, thereby reducing their liability.

:p How might Watts's prior conviction affect Buy-Mart’s liability?
??x
Watts's prior conviction for felony assault and battery may limit Buy-Mart's liability if she disclosed this information during the application process. Since Buy-Mart hired her despite this disclosure, they would likely be held to a higher standard of due diligence in their hiring practices.

However, the extent of this limitation depends on whether the company conducted appropriate background checks or had other measures in place to mitigate risks associated with employees with criminal histories.
x??

---
#### Doctrine of Vicarious Liability

The doctrine of **vicarious liability** is discussed in the context where an employer might be held responsible for the wrongful acts of their agents. This concept is closely related to respondeat superior but focuses on the legal responsibility imposed on employers.

:p What is vicarious liability, and how does it relate to respondeat superior?
??x
Vicarious liability refers to a legal principle where an employer can be held responsible for the wrongful acts of their employees. This concept is closely related to **respondeat superior**, which specifically holds employers liable for torts committed by employees within the scope of employment.

In both doctrines, the core idea is that the employer's liability arises not because of direct fault but rather due to the relationship between the employer and employee.

#### Issue Spotter 1: Respondeat Superior in Contract Law

In this scenario, Davis acts as an agent for Estee. Although Estee asked Davis to keep her identity secret, Davis made a contract with Farmland Stables. When Estee fails to pay the balance, Farmland Stables sues Davis.

:p Can Davis hold Estee liable for damages he has to pay?
??x
No, Davis cannot hold Estee liable for the damages he has to pay because Davis is acting as an agent for Estee in this transaction. Under respondeat superior and agency principles, it's typically the principal (Estee) who would be held liable for any contractual obligations or breaches by the agent (Davis).

In legal terms:
- **Agent**: Davis
- **Principal**: Estee

The liability falls on the principal unless there are specific circumstances where the agent can assert certain defenses.

#### Issue Spotter 2: Unauthorized Representation and Respondeat Superior

Xena, an administrative assistant employed by Wonder Goods Company (Vivian), signs a promissory note without proper authorization. When Vivian is absent.

:p Under what circumstances would Vivian be liable on the promissory note?
??x
Vivian could be held liable for the promissory note if she ratified Xena's unauthorized actions or if Xena had apparent authority to act in this capacity while Vivian was absent.

Key factors include:
- **Apparent Authority**: If Xena’s behavior reasonably appeared to have been authorized by Vivian.
- **Ratification**: If Vivian subsequently approved of the action after it occurred, even though she initially did not authorize it.

In respondeat superior terms, if the actions were within the apparent scope of employment and Vivian had a duty to supervise or control Xena, then Vivian might be held liable.

#### Business Scenario 33–1: Unauthorized Property Purchase

Janell Arden, an employee of A&B Coal Supply partnership, contracts with Will Wilson for land without proper authorization. The contract appears in her name as the agent.

:p Discuss the rights of A&B and Wilson concerning the land contract?
??x
A&B Coal Supply partnership has several potential claims against both Janell Arden and Will Wilson:

1. **Fraud**: A&B can claim fraud if it can prove that Arden misrepresented the value or nature of the property.
2. **Unjust Enrichment**: If the partnership can show that they have been unjustly enriched at their expense due to the contract.
3. **Recovery for Breach**: A&B may seek to recover from either party, but primarily from Janell if she cannot be held individually.

For Wilson:
- **Unjust Enrichment**: Wilson might claim unjust enrichment if he has already fulfilled his obligations under the contract and A&B Coal Supply does not intend to proceed with the purchase.
- **Breach of Contract**: If the value significantly increased, Wilson can sue for breach of contract or seek rescission.

The managing partner's fury suggests internal disputes over the acquisition. The key is proving whether Arden acted within the scope of her authority and whether A&B had a reasonable expectation to rely on her actions.

#### Agent's Authority and Liability for Contracts (Huskin v. Hall)
Background context: In Huskin v. Hall, 2012 WL 553136 (Ohio Ct.App. 2012), Basic Research, LLC advertised its products on television networks owned by Rainbow Media Holdings, Inc., through an ad agency, Icebox Advertising, Inc. Icebox had the express authority to buy ads from Rainbow on Basic’s behalf but was limited to buying ads with cash in advance. Despite this limitation, Rainbow sold ads to Basic through Icebox on credit. Basic paid Icebox for the ads, but Icebox did not pass all of the payments on to Rainbow. Icebox later filed for bankruptcy.
:p Can Rainbow recoup the unpaid amounts from Basic?
??x
Rainbow can potentially recoup the unpaid amounts from Basic because Icebox had the authority to buy ads from Rainbow with cash in advance, and although it was done through an unauthorized credit transaction, Basic’s payments to Icebox can be traced back to Basic's contractual obligations under the agreement. The key is whether Basic knew about or ratified the unauthorized transactions.
??x
Rainbow might seek to recoup the unpaid amounts by arguing that while Icebox did not have express authority to enter into credit agreements with Rainbow, it had apparent authority due to Basic’s payments and knowledge of the transactions. However, this would depend on the specific facts and whether there was ratification or estoppel.
```java
// Example Java code for tracing payments:
public class PaymentTracer {
    public boolean canRecoup(String payee, String payer) {
        // Logic to check if payment from payer to payee is valid and can be traced back
        return true;  // Simplified example
    }
}
```

#### Agent's Duty of Accounting (Holden v. Holden)
Background context: In Holden v. Holden, Terry Holden’s stepmother Rosie executed a durable power of attorney appointing Susan as her agent. Susan opened a joint bank account with Rosie at Bank of America and deposited $9,643.62 of Rosie’s funds. Susan used some of the money to pay for household expenses while taking care of Rosie. Upon Rosie's death, Terry’s father Charles, as executor of Rosie’s estate, filed a petition in a Texas state court against Susan for an accounting.
:p What general duty did Susan owe Rosie as her agent?
??x
Susan owed Rosie a fiduciary duty of loyalty and care, which includes the duty to account for all funds managed on behalf of the principal. This means that Susan was required to keep accurate records of all transactions and provide a full accounting when needed.
??x
Susan's duty of accounting requires her to ensure transparency in financial dealings, maintain accurate records, and provide a detailed account of how she used the funds. The duty is based on the fiduciary relationship between an agent and their principal.
```java
// Example Java code for an accounting system:
public class AccountingSystem {
    public void recordTransaction(String transactionType, double amount) {
        // Code to record transactions in an accounting ledger
    }
    
    public String generateAccountingReport() {
        // Code to generate a report of all transactions
        return "Accounting Report Generated";
    }
}
```

#### Scope of Agent's Authority (Kindred Nursing Centers East, LLC v. Jones)
Background context: In Kindred Nursing Centers East, LLC v. Jones, 201 So.3d 1146 (Ala. 2016), Yvonne Barbour signed the admission forms as her mother Lorene Jones's representative when Jones was admitted to Whitesburg Gardens for rehabilitation after knee-replacement surgery. The forms included an "Alternative Dispute Resolution Agreement" providing for binding arbitration in case of a dispute.
:p Can Jones be compelled to submit her claim to arbitration?
??x
Jones can likely be compelled to submit her claim to arbitration because the admission forms signed by Yvonne Barbour as her mother's representative contained a valid and enforceable Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) agreement. The key issue is whether Yvonne had proper authority to sign the forms on Jones’s behalf.
??x
The validity of the ADR agreement depends on several factors, including whether Yvonne had actual or apparent authority to bind Jones. If Yvonne was properly authorized by a durable power of attorney or other legal document, then she likely had the necessary authority to agree to arbitration. However, if there are doubts about her authority or if Jones objected and did not ratify the agreement, the validity could be contested.
```java
// Example Java code for validating authorization:
public class AuthorizationValidator {
    public boolean validateAuthorization(String agent, String principal) {
        // Logic to check if an agent has valid authorization to sign on behalf of a principal
        return true;  // Simplified example
    }
}
```

#### Agent's Authority in Service Agreements (Devin Fink and Precision Tune Auto Care)
Background context: In Devin Fink case, Fink was the manager at Precision Tune Auto Care. Randall Stywall brought her car to the shop for rear shock replacement, and Fink filled out a service order with an estimate.
:p Can the service agreement be valid if Fink acted beyond his authority?
??x
The validity of the service agreement depends on whether Fink had the appropriate authority to sign or agree to certain terms. If Fink exceeded his authority, the agreement might not be enforceable against Precision Tune Auto Care.
??x
Fink's authority should be defined by the company’s policies and any written agreements. If Fink acted beyond these boundaries without proper authorization from Precision Tune Auto Care, the service agreement could be void or unenforceable. However, if Fink was acting within his known or apparent authority, the agreement would likely hold.
```java
// Example Java code for checking agent's authority:
public class AuthorityChecker {
    public boolean checkAuthority(String action, String agent) {
        // Logic to verify if an agent has authority to perform a specific action
        return true;  // Simplified example
    }
}
```

#### Employment at Will Doctrine
The traditional common law doctrine allows either party to terminate an employment relationship at any time and for any reason, unless it violates statutory or contractual rights. In the U.S., only Montana does not apply this doctrine.

:p What is the employment-at-will doctrine?
??x
The employment-at-will doctrine allows employers and employees to terminate an employment relationship at any time and for any reason, provided that the termination does not violate specific federal or state laws.
x??

---
#### Statutory Law Impact on Employment At Will
Federal and state statutes now prevent the employment-at-will doctrine from being applied in many circumstances. For instance, an employer cannot fire an employee to avoid violating a law such as those prohibiting discrimination.

:p How do statutory laws affect the employment-at-will doctrine?
??x
Statutory laws limit the application of the employment-at-will doctrine by making it illegal for employers to terminate employees in ways that violate specific federal or state statutes, such as anti-discrimination laws.
x??

---
#### Exceptions Based on Contract Theory
Courts have recognized implied contracts between employers and employees, which can protect an employee from termination outside the terms of this implied contract. For instance, if a manual states there will be no dismissals without good cause, it might imply a contract that cannot be violated without legal consequences.

:p Can you give an example where an implied employment contract exists?
??x
If BDI Enterprises’ manual and personnel bulletin state that workers will only be dismissed for good cause, Julie Chin may succeed in a breach of contract claim if she can show that she reasonably expected the company to follow this policy.
```java
public class Example {
    public static boolean isTerminationValid(String reasonForTermination, boolean followsPolicy) {
        // Assume the policy states terminations should only be for good cause
        return (reasonForTermination.equals("good cause") && followsPolicy);
    }
}
```
x??

---
#### Common Law Exceptions to Employment At Will Doctrine
Courts have carved out various exceptions to the employment-at-will doctrine based on contract theory, tort theory, and public policy. These exceptions allow employees to bring legal actions for wrongful termination even if no formal contract exists.

:p What are some common law exceptions to the employment-at-will doctrine?
??x
Common law exceptions include:
1. Implied Employment Contract: Courts may find that an implied contract exists based on company policies.
2. Tort Theory: Employees can sue for wrongful termination, especially if their rights are violated through tortious behavior.
3. Public Policy: Termination actions that violate public policy (e.g., firing someone to avoid a discrimination lawsuit) are not allowed.

For example, BDI Enterprises’ policy of only dismissing employees for good cause might imply an employment contract.
x??

---
#### Tort Theory Exceptions
Courts have recognized exceptions based on tort theory where wrongful termination can be actionable. This includes situations where the employer's actions violate common law tort principles such as defamation or infliction of emotional distress.

:p Can you explain how tort theory applies to wrongful termination?
??x
Tort theory allows employees to sue for wrongful termination if their rights are violated through tortious behavior by the employer, such as defamation or inflicting emotional distress.
```java
public class Example {
    public static boolean canSueForWrongfulTermination(String reason, String violation) {
        // Assume defamation and emotional distress violations exist
        return (violation.equals("defamation") || violation.equals("emotional distress"));
    }
}
```
x??

---
#### Public Policy Exceptions
Public policy exceptions to the employment-at-will doctrine allow employees to sue for wrongful termination if their rights under public policy are violated. For example, terminating an employee to avoid a discrimination lawsuit would be illegal.

:p What is the public policy exception in wrongful termination?
??x
The public policy exception allows employees to sue for wrongful termination when their termination violates a strong public policy, such as firing someone to avoid a discrimination lawsuit.
```java
public class Example {
    public static boolean isViolationOfPublicPolicy(String reason) {
        // Assume firing to avoid a discrimination lawsuit is a violation of public policy
        return (reason.equals("avoiding a discrimination lawsuit"));
    }
}
```
