#### Trade Secrets Overview
Trade secrets are valuable business processes or information that are not patented, copyrighted, or trademarked. Examples include customer lists, plans, research and development, pricing information, marketing methods, production techniques, and anything that makes a company unique. Unlike other types of intellectual property protection, trade secret protection covers both ideas and their expression.
:p What distinguishes trade secrets from other forms of IP protection?
??x
Trade secrets distinguish themselves by protecting both the idea itself (the concept or method) and its expression (how it is implemented). Unlike copyright, trademark, and patent protection, there are no registration or filing requirements for trade secrets. This makes them a potentially attractive option for software companies looking to protect their unique business methods.

#### Legal Protection of Trade Secrets
Under Section 757 of the Restatement of Torts, those who disclose or use another's trade secret without authorization are liable if they either:
1. Discover the secret by improper means.
2. Their disclosure or use breaches a duty owed to the other party.

The Economic Espionage Act makes theft of trade secrets a federal crime.
:p What legal actions can be taken against someone who improperly uses or discloses another's trade secret?
??x
Legal actions include liability for those who:
1. Discover the secret by improper means, such as stealing confidential business data.
2. Disclose or use the secret in breach of a duty owed to the other party.

The Economic Espionage Act further criminalizes this activity at the federal level.

#### Cyber Threats to Trade Secrets
Computer technology has made it easier for employees to steal trade secrets, such as by emailing them out, taking physical media like flash drives, or misusing company social media accounts. These actions can compromise confidential information despite not necessarily involving a direct contractual violation.
:p How does computer technology affect the protection of trade secrets?
??x
Computer technology poses significant risks to trade secret protection because:
1. Employees can easily send sensitive information via email.
2. Physical devices like flash drives allow for physical theft of data.
3. Misuse of company social media accounts can lead to unauthorized disclosure.

These methods bypass traditional contractual protections and increase the risk of trade secret theft.
