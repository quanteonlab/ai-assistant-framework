#### Issue Spotter 1 - E-Design and Fav-O-Rite Supplies
Background context: E-Design, Inc., orders 150 computer desks from Fav-O-Rite Suppl-ies, Inc. However, Fav-O-Rite ships 150 printer stands instead.
:p Is this an acceptance of the offer or a counteroffer? If it is an acceptance, is it a breach of the contract? Why or why not?
??x
This situation involves a deviation from the original order and can be considered a counteroffer. An acceptance must mirror the terms of the original offer; otherwise, it constitutes a rejection of the original offer and a new proposal (counteroffer). Since Fav-O-Rite shipped printer stands instead of computer desks, this is not an acceptance but a counteroffer.

If Fav-O-Rite had told E-Design it was sending the printer stands as "an accommodation," it would imply that they are providing the goods out of goodwill rather than in response to E-Design's original order. This could be seen as a charitable act or a gesture, not part of a formal contract.

In either case, without an explicit acceptance by E-Design to this counteroffer, there is no binding agreement.

#### Issue Spotter 2 - Truck Parts and United Fix-It
Background context: Truck Parts, Inc. (TPI) often sells supplies to United Fix-It Company (UFC). They negotiate for the sale of eighty-four sets of tires over the phone, followed by a letter from TPI detailing the terms.
:p Is there an enforceable contract between them? Why or why not?
??x
There is no enforceable contract because the offer and acceptance process was incomplete. An oral agreement (negotiation) does not create a binding contract unless it is followed by a written confirmation that both parties have agreed to, detailing all terms.

Sending a letter from TPI with detailed terms two weeks after the initial phone call does not constitute an acceptance of the original offer because there were no discussions or agreements following the initial offer. The shipment of tires without prior agreement would also be considered a breach if UFC was not prepared to accept them.

#### Business Scenario 20-1 - Merchant’s Firm Offer
Background context: Jennings, a car dealer, offers Wheeler a 1955 Thunderbird convertible for $13,500. Wheeler accepts after Jennings sells the car elsewhere.
:p Is Jennings in breach? Explain.
??x
Jennings is not in breach of contract because he provided a firm offer with a specific time limit (before June 9). By selling the car to another party before that deadline, he acted within his rights as there was no mutual agreement on all terms by the time Wheeler accepted. Jennings's action falls under the mailbox rule—acceptance is effective when it reaches the offeree, not necessarily when it is sent.
??x

#### Business Scenario 20-2 - Additional Terms
Background context: Strike offers Bailey one thousand shirts for a stated price with shipment by Dependable truck line. Bailey replies that delivery should be by Yellow Express truck line instead.
:p Discuss fully Bailey’s claims.
??x
Bailey's first claim is that there never was a contract because his reply included additional terms, which did not constitute an acceptance under the UCC rules (specifically Section 2-207). The reply did modify the carrier from Dependable to Yellow Express, making it a counteroffer rather than an acceptance.

Regarding Bailey's second claim, if a contract does exist based on Strike’s original offer and Bailey’s acceptance without modifications, then Strike would not be in breach because he shipped the shirts as agreed (by Dependable).

#### Business Scenario 20-3 - Additional Terms Revisited
Background context: B.S. International, Ltd., makes costume jewelry, while JMAM, LLC, wholesales it. JMAM sent BSI terms with credit procedures; Steven Baracsi signed and returned the letter.
:p What is BSI's claim against JMAM?
??x
BSI’s claim is that $41,294.21 worth of unreturned items should be paid as per the agreement set out in the terms sent by JMAM with their signature agreeing to the terms.

The key here is whether the signed letter by Steven Baracsi represents a binding acceptance of all terms or just an acknowledgment. If BSI shows that the terms were understood and accepted by signing, then JMAM is liable for the returned items.

#### Concept: International Sale of Coffee - Contract Overview
Background context explaining that this is an example contract for a sale of coffee imported internationally, and it covers various terms and conditions relevant to such contracts. The text mentions different jurisdictions (CISG and UCC) based on parties' principal places of business.
:p What are the key aspects covered in this international sale contract?
??x
The key aspects include quantity, weight per unit, packaging requirements, bulk shipments, description and markings, payment terms, delivery conditions, and documentation. 
It also specifies that if the seller insists on actual cash, the buyer must be given a reasonable time to get it.
??x
---

---
#### Concept: Quantity in Contracts
Background context highlighting the importance of specifying quantity in contracts to ensure enforceability by courts. It explains how weight per unit can be exactly or approximately stated and that usage of trade in international contracts determines standards if not specified.
:p Why is the quantity term crucial in a contract?
??x
The quantity term is crucial because it ensures that the court can enforce the contract. Without a clear quantity, it would be challenging to determine what was agreed upon by both parties.
??x
---

---
#### Concept: Weight Per Unit in Contracts
Background context discussing how weight per unit can be exactly or approximately stated and explaining that if not specified, standards of weight are determined by usage of trade in international contracts.
:p How is the weight per unit typically handled in an international coffee contract?
??x
The weight per unit (bag) can be precisely defined or approximated. If it's not specified, international trade practices determine the standard for weight.
??x
---

---
#### Concept: Packaging Requirements and Acceptance
Background context mentioning that packaging requirements can serve as conditions for acceptance and payment in contracts. It also notes that bulk shipments are not allowed without the buyer’s consent.
:p How do packaging requirements impact a contract?
??x
Packaging requirements can be critical terms that affect acceptance and payment. The contract specifies these to ensure goods meet certain quality or delivery standards, impacting both parties' obligations.
??x
---

---
#### Concept: Bulk Shipments in Contracts
Background context explaining that bulk shipments are not permitted without the explicit consent of the buyer. This is noted as a condition for the validity of the agreement.
:p Are bulk shipments allowed under this contract?
??x
No, bulk shipments are not allowed unless explicitly agreed upon by the buyer. The contract does not permit them without the buyer's consent.
??x
---

---
#### Concept: Descriptions and Markings in Contracts
Background context indicating that descriptions and markings of goods constitute express warranties. It states that international contracts rely more on these than domestic ones, which often use warranties.
:p How do descriptions and markings function as warranties in an international coffee contract?
??x
Descriptions and markings of the coffee are considered express warranties. These terms are more heavily relied upon in international contracts compared to domestic ones, where explicit warranty statements might be preferred.
??x
---

---
#### Concept: Price Determination Under CISG
Background context explaining that under the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG), a contract must specify an exact price determination. It contrasts this with the UCC, which allows for a valid contract even without setting the price.
:p How is the price determined in a CISG contract?
??x
In a CISG contract, the price must be exactly determined as part of the agreement. This differs from the UCC, where parties may enter into a valid contract without explicitly setting the price.
??x
---

---
#### Concept: Payment Terms - Credit vs. Cash
Background context discussing that payment terms can take one of two forms: credit or cash. It explains that while credit terms can be complicated, cash terms are simple and can involve various means such as personal checks or letters of credit.
:p What are the main payment options in this contract?
??x
The main payment options are either credit terms (which can be complex) or cash terms (simple, involving payments via personal checks or letters of credit). The contract does not specify which is used but leaves flexibility for the buyer to choose.
??x
---

---
#### Concept: Tender and Conformity with Contract Terms
Background context describing that tender involves placing goods conforming to the contract at the buyer's disposal. It mentions that this contract requires coffee to meet import regulations and be ready for pickup from a bonded warehouse.
:p What does "tender" mean in this contract?
??x
Tender means the seller has placed goods that conform to the contract terms at the buyer’s disposal, ensuring they are ready for pickup. This includes meeting all import regulations as stipulated by the agreement.
??x
---

---
#### Concept: Delivery Date and Inspections
Background context explaining that delivery dates are significant; if not met, it can lead to a breach of contract. It also notes that the seller is given a period within which to deliver goods or rectify them after inspection.
:p What role does the delivery date play in this contract?
??x
The delivery date is crucial as failure to meet it may result in the buyer considering the seller in breach of the contract. The seller has a "period" rather than a specific day to deliver and time to rectify goods if they do not pass inspection.
??x
---

---
#### Concept: Documentation in Contracts
Background context discussing that documents are often incorporated by reference, making it easier for readability. It mentions that revising these documents can necessitate reworking the entire contract.
:p Why might documentation be incorporated by reference in a contract?
??x
Documentation is often incorporated by reference to avoid lengthy and potentially confusing verbatim inclusion of detailed terms. This approach simplifies the contract but requires careful management if any part needs revision, as it could affect the entire agreement.
??x
---

---
#### Contingency of Contract
The contract is independent and not contingent upon any other agreement, emphasizing its self-sufficiency.
:p What does "CONTINGENCY: This contract is not contingent upon any other contract" mean?
??x
This statement ensures that the validity and enforceability of this contract are not dependent on another agreement. If there were contingencies linked to other contracts, it could create uncertainties or delays in execution.
x??

---
#### Claims Procedure
A detailed timeline and process for resolving claims related to coffee quality is outlined, emphasizing timely resolution through mutual agreement or arbitration.
:p According to the text, what are the procedures for settling claims regarding coffee quality?
??x
Claims must be settled within 15 calendar days after delivery at Bonded Public Warehouse or upon receiving all Government clearances. The parties can either settle the claim themselves (a) or initiate arbitration proceedings (b). If neither is done by the deadline, and samples have not been drawn, Seller's responsibility for quality claims ceases.
x??

---
#### Delivery Terms
Specifics about the delivery of coffee, including chop limits, uniformity requirements, and notice obligations are detailed.
:p What are the key terms related to delivery as stated in the contract?
??x
Delivery involves no more than three chops per lot of 250 bags, with each chop required to be uniform. The Seller must ensure that any necessary expenses for making coffee uniform are covered by them. Notice of arrival and/or sampling order must be given within five business days after delivery at the Bonded Public Warehouse.
x??

---
#### Insurance Responsibility
The contract specifies who is responsible for insuring the coffee during transportation and upon arrival at the bonded warehouse.
:p Who is responsible for insurance according to the text?
??x
Seller is responsible for any loss or damage until the coffee is delivered and discharged at the Bonded Public Warehouse in the Country of Importation. Buyer's responsibility starts from the day of importation or tender, whichever comes later.
x??

---
#### Freight Responsibility
The contract assigns all transportation costs to the Seller up to the delivery point at the Bonded Public Warehouse.
:p Who is responsible for the transportation and related expenses?
??x
Seller must provide and pay for all transportation and related expenses to the Bonded Public Warehouse in the Country of Importation. This responsibility includes covering any necessary uniformity adjustments.
x??

---
#### Export Taxes
The text mentions that the Exporter is liable for all export-related taxes, duties, or fees.
:p What are the Exporter's responsibilities regarding taxes?
??x
Exporters must pay all export taxes, duties, or other fees levied due to exportation. This includes any charges related to moving goods out of the exporting country.
x??

---
#### Duties and Taxes for Import
The Importer/Buyer is responsible for paying any Duty or Tax imposed by the government or authority in the Country of Importation upon importation.
:p Who pays duties and taxes when importing?
??x
The Importer/Buyer is responsible for paying any duty or tax imposed by the government or any authority in the Country of Importation. This responsibility begins at the moment of importation.
x??

---
#### Insolvency Provisions
The contract includes provisions that allow either party to declare a breach if the other meets financial difficulties, bankruptcy, or insolvency.
:p What happens in case of an insolvency event according to the text?
??x
In case of insolvency (such as inability to pay obligations, filing for bankruptcy), the other party may at their option declare this as a breach and default. They can then choose to decline further delivery or payment, sell or purchase on behalf of the defaulting party, or claim damages.
x??

#### Identification of Existing Goods
Background context: This section explains how specific and determined goods already in existence can be identified to a contract. Once identified, title and risk of loss pass from the seller to the buyer or lessee. The identification takes place at the time the contract is made.

:p How does identification work for existing goods?
??x
Identification works by designating specific, existing goods as the subject matter of a sales or lease contract. This happens at the moment the contract is made. Once identified, the buyer or lessee acquires an insurable interest in the goods.
Example:
```java
// Example Java code to illustrate identification
public class GoodsContract {
    private String[] vins; // Vehicle Identification Numbers

    public void identifyGoods(String[] vins) {
        this.vins = vins;
        System.out.println("Identification of existing goods successful.");
    }

    public boolean isIdentified() {
        return vins != null && vins.length > 0;
    }
}
```
In the example, `GoodsContract` class identifies existing goods by setting their vehicle identification numbers (VINs). Once identified, it can be verified if the goods are identified.
x??

---

#### Example of Existing Goods
Background context: This example illustrates a situation where specific cars are designated for a lease contract based on their VINs. Identification has taken place at the time the contract is made, giving Litco an insurable interest in these vehicles.

:p How does identification take place in this scenario?
??x
Identification takes place when specific goods (in this case, five cars) are designated by their vehicle identification numbers (VINs). At the time of contracting, the cars are identified as the subject matter. This gives Litco an insurable interest in the cars.
Example:
```java
public class LitcoLeaseContract {
    private String[] vins; // Vehicle Identification Numbers

    public void identifyCars(String[] vins) {
        this.vins = vins;
        System.out.println("Identifying specific cars for lease contract.");
    }

    public boolean isIdentified() {
        return vins != null && vins.length > 0;
    }
}
```
In the example, `LitcoLeaseContract` class identifies five cars by setting their VINs. Once identified, Litco can acquire an insurable interest in these specific vehicles.
x??

#### Identification of Future Goods - Unborn Animals
Background context: This section covers how future goods, such as unborn animals or crops, are identified within a contract. For animals expected to be born within 12 months, identification occurs when the animal is conceived.

:p How is identification for future goods like unborn animals handled?
??x
Identification of future goods like unborn animals (to be born within 12 months) takes place at the time the animals are conceived. This means that even though the animals do not exist yet, their conception marks the point where they can be designated as the subject matter of a sales or lease contract.
Example:
```java
public class FutureAnimalsContract {
    private String[] animalIds; // IDs for unborn animals

    public void conceiveAnimals(String[] animalIds) {
        this.animalIds = animalIds;
        System.out.println("Identifying future animals by their conception.");
    }

    public boolean isConceived() {
        return animalIds != null && animalIds.length > 0;
    }
}
```
In the example, `FutureAnimalsContract` class identifies future animals by setting their IDs upon conception. Once conceived and identified, these animals can be part of a contract.
x??

---

#### Identification of Future Goods - Crops
Background context: This section explains how crops that are to be harvested within 12 months are identified when the crops are planted. If not specified otherwise, identification occurs when the crops begin to grow.

:p How is identification for future crops handled?
??x
Identification of future crops takes place at different stages depending on their lifecycle. For crops expected to be harvested within 12 months, identification happens when the crops are planted. If no specific harvest time is mentioned in the contract, identification occurs when the crops start growing.
Example:
```java
public class FutureCropsContract {
    private String[] cropIds; // IDs for future crops

    public void plantCrops(String[] cropIds) {
        this.cropIds = cropIds;
        System.out.println("Identifying future crops by planting them.");
    }

    public boolean isPlanted() {
        return cropIds != null && cropIds.length > 0;
    }
}
```
In the example, `FutureCropsContract` class identifies future crops by setting their IDs upon planting. Once planted and growing, these crops can be part of a contract.
x??

---

#### Identification of Other Future Goods
Background context: This section covers how other types of future goods are identified when the seller or lessor ships, marks, or otherwise designates them as those to which the contract refers.

:p How is identification handled for other types of future goods?
??x
Identification for other future goods takes place when the seller or lessor takes specific actions such as shipping, marking, or otherwise designating the goods. These actions confirm that the goods are now part of the contract.
Example:
```java
public class FutureGoodsContract {
    private String[] goodsIds; // IDs for other future goods

    public void designateGoods(String[] goodsIds) {
        this.goodsIds = goodsIds;
        System.out.println("Designating specific future goods as subject matter.");
    }

    public boolean isDesignated() {
        return goodsIds != null && goodsIds.length > 0;
    }
}
```
In the example, `FutureGoodsContract` class identifies other types of future goods by setting their IDs once they are designated. Once designated, these goods can be part of a contract.

#### Passage of Title under UCC 2–401

Background context: Under Section 2–401 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), the passage of title for goods is determined by specific conditions unless otherwise explicitly agreed upon. The key provision states that title generally passes when the seller delivers the goods to the buyer, unless there's an explicit agreement stating otherwise.

:p How does UCC 2-401 generally determine when title passes?
??x
UCC 2-401 generally determines that title passes at the time and place where the seller performs by delivering the goods. This means that unless explicitly agreed upon otherwise, ownership of the goods transfers to the buyer once they are physically delivered.
x??

---

#### Example Scenario: Custom Motorcycle Contract

Background context: In this case, Timothy Allen contracted with Indy Route 66 Cycles, Inc., for a custom-built motorcycle. The relevant legal issue revolves around whether title passed when Indy kept possession of a "Certificate of Origin" or if delivery to Allen was sufficient.

:p According to the court's ruling in UCC Section 2-401(2), under what condition did title pass to Timothy Allen?
??x
Title passed to Timothy Allen because Indy gave up physical possession of the motorcycle, which is sufficient for title transfer according to UCC Section 2-401(2). The "Certificate of Origin" alone was not enough to prevent this.
x??

---

#### Fuel Oil Adulteration Case: Castle Oil

Background context: In this case, plaintiffs alleged that Castle Oil intentionally adulterated its fuel oil products by using cheaper oils (mainly used motor and lubricating oil) as fillers. This practice is illegal because it results in an inferior blended petroleum product that does not meet ASTM specifications.

:p According to the plaintiffs' claims, what chemical property of lubricating oil makes it unsuitable for use as fuel?
??x
Lubricating oil has a higher boiling point than fuel oil and does not burn efficiently at temperatures typical in non-industrial heating systems. This makes it unsuitable for use as fuel.
x??

---

#### Fuel Oil Adulteration Case: Hess

Background context: The plaintiffs alleged that the Hess fuel oil was mixed with 15-25 percent "waste oil," which is defined by New York State regulations and has contaminants that impair heating system performance. This mixing resulted in a product with lower heat content.

:p According to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, what defines "waste oil"?
??x
According to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, waste oil includes used and/or reprocessed engine lubricating oil and/or any other used oil, including but not limited to, fuel oil, engine oil, gear oil, cutting oil, transmission fluid, hydraulic fluid, dielectric fluid, oil storage tank residue, animal oil, and vegetable oil, which has not subsequently been re-refined.
x??

---

#### Drones in Goods Delivery

Background context: The text mentions that the delivery of goods may be accomplished by drones in the future. This is part of a broader discussion on how technology might change traditional commercial practices.

:p How could the use of drones affect the passage of title under UCC 2-401?
??x
The use of drones for delivering goods would not fundamentally alter the passage of title according to UCC 2-401, as long as the seller completes delivery. Title generally passes when the goods are delivered, and this could include drone-delivered goods.
x??

---

---
#### Shipment Contracts vs. Destination Contracts
Shipment contracts and destination contracts determine when title passes from the seller to the buyer based on delivery arrangements. In a shipment contract, the seller is only required to deliver goods to a carrier, and title transfers at the time of shipment [UCC 2–401(2)(a)]. In a destination contract, the seller must deliver goods directly or indirectly to the designated destination, and title passes when the goods are tendered there [UCC 2–401(2)(b)].
:p What is the difference between a shipment contract and a destination contract?
??x
In a shipment contract, the seller delivers goods to a carrier, and title transfers at the time of shipment. In contrast, in a destination contract, the seller must deliver the goods directly or indirectly to a designated destination, and title passes when the goods are tendered there.
x??
---

---
#### Customary Practices and Contractual Agreements
Customary practices between parties can influence interpretations of contracts. The court may consider these practices if not explicitly stated in the contract. In this case, LDR argued that the contract mandated property ownership to AC up until installation due to their custom, but the judge found no such language in the actual contract.
:p How did the customary practices affect the interpretation of the contract?
??x
Customary practices between parties can influence interpretations of contracts if not explicitly stated. In this case, LDR argued that the contract mandated property ownership to AC up until installation due to their custom, but the judge found no such language in the actual contract.
x??
---

---
#### Risk of Loss or Damage
Under certain conditions, risk of loss or damage can remain with the contractor until delivery to a carrier (FOB origin) or directly to the government at a specified destination. The specific condition is that "Risk of loss or damage to the supplies provided under this contract shall remain with the contractor until, and shall pass to the government upon: (1) Delivery of the supplies to a carrier, if transportation is FOB origin, or (2) Delivery of the supplies to the Government at the destination specified in the contract."
:p What conditions determine when risk of loss or damage passes to the buyer under FOB terms?
??x
Under FOB terms, the risk of loss or damage remains with the contractor until delivery to a carrier (FOB origin) or directly to the government at a specified destination. The specific condition is that "Risk of loss or damage to the supplies provided under this contract shall remain with the contractor until, and shall pass to the government upon: (1) Delivery of the supplies to a carrier, if transportation is FOB origin, or (2) Delivery of the supplies to the Government at the destination specified in the contract."

#### Background of Alaska Air Group and Horizon Air Contract
Alaska Air Group, Inc. (AAG) and Horizon Air Industries, Inc., contracted to purchase thirty Embraer 175 (E175) regional jets from the manufacturer. Deliveries began but faced delays due to a shortage of qualified pilots at Horizon.
:p What is the background context about AAG and Horizon's contract?
??x
Alaska Air Group, Inc. (AAG) and Horizon Air Industries, Inc., contracted to purchase thirty Embraer 175 (E175) regional jets from the manufacturer. Deliveries began but faced delays due to a shortage of qualified pilots at Horizon.
x??

---

#### Labor Law Violations Alleged by the Union
The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Airline Division, and its Airline Professionals Association filed a lawsuit against AAG and Horizon alleging labor law violations. The union claimed that AAG and Horizon had committed to acquiring no fewer than thirty E175s to be flown exclusively by union pilots.
:p What did the union allege in their lawsuit?
??x
The union alleged that AAG and Horizon had committed to acquiring no fewer than thirty Embraer 175 (E175) regional jets, which were to be flown exclusively by union pilots. They claimed that five of these intended E175s were subsequently "diverted" to SkyWest, violating the rights of union pilots.
x??

---

#### Application of UCC Section 2–401
The court applied UCC Section 2–401 to the dispute over the sale of the five aircraft. The section states that title to goods (when no document of title is required) does not pass until identification occurs. In this case, Horizon’s purchase contract did not identify specific E175s by serial or registration numbers.
:p What UCC section was applied in the court ruling?
??x
The court applied UCC Section 2–401 to the dispute over the sale of the five aircraft. This section states that title to goods (when no document of title is required) does not pass until identification occurs. In this case, Horizon’s purchase contract did not identify specific E175s by serial or registration numbers.
x??

---

#### Title and Identification in Sales
The court ruled that the sale of five E175s to SkyWest did not affect Horizon's agreement to purchase thirty E175s because there was no clear evidence that the SkyWest E175s were ever "earmarked" for Horizon. Therefore, the sale did not violate the rights of union pilots.
:p How did the court rule on the title transfer in this case?
??x
The court ruled that the sale of five E175s to SkyWest did not affect Horizon's agreement to purchase thirty E175s because there was no clear evidence that the SkyWest E175s were ever "earmarked" for Horizon. Therefore, the sale did not violate the rights of union pilots.
x??

---

#### Rights of Buyers and Lessees
Sections 2–402 and 2–403 of the UCC deal with the rights of two parties who lay claim to the same goods sold with imperfect titles. Generally, a buyer acquires at least whatever title the seller has to the goods sold.
:p What does Section 2-401 of the UCC cover in terms of sales?
??x
Section 2–401 of the UCC covers when title to goods (when no document of title is required) passes. It states that title does not pass until identification occurs. In this context, it was used to determine whether Horizon's purchase contract with SkyWest affected their agreement with AAG and Horizon.
x??

---

#### Void Title in Sales
If a buyer purchases goods from a seller who is not the owner of the goods (e.g., a thief), the seller’s title is void. The buyer acquires no title, and the real owner can reclaim the goods from the buyer.
:p What happens if a buyer unknowingly purchases goods from a non-owner?
??x
If a buyer purchases goods from a seller who is not the owner of the goods (e.g., a thief), the seller’s title is void. The buyer acquires no title, and the real owner can reclaim the goods from the buyer. For example, if Saki steals diamonds owned by Shannon and sells them to Valdez, Shannon can reclaim the diamonds even though Valdez acted in good faith.
x??

---

#### Leases Under Article 2A
Article 2A of the UCC contains similar provisions for leases. A lessee acquires a leasehold interest in the goods that is subject to the lease contract.
:p What does Article 2A cover regarding leases?
??x
Article 2A of the UCC covers leases and states that a lessee acquires a leasehold interest in the goods, which is subject to the terms of the lease contract. For example, a lessee would acquire whatever leasehold interest the lessor has or can transfer.
