**Starting Chapter:** 27-2 Warranty Liability

#### Imposter Rule
Background context: The imposter rule deals with situations where a person, through deception, induces a maker or drawer to issue an instrument in the name of an impersonated payee. This can occur through personal appearance or various forms of communication like mail, internet, or telephone.
The UCC 3-404(a) states that an imposter’s indorsement will be effective—that is, not treated as a forgery—regardless of whether the real payee would have signed if present. The intent of the maker or drawer at the time of issuance is crucial here.

:p What is the key idea behind the imposter rule?
??x
The key idea is that an imposter’s indorsement will not be treated as unauthorized when the instrument is transferred to an innocent party, provided the maker or drawer believed the imposter was the named payee at the time of issue. This means the maker or drawer intended for the imposter to receive the instrument.

#### Fictitious Payees
Background context: A fictitious payee is a person or firm that does not truly exist, or an identifiable party that will not acquire any interest in the instrument. The UCC’s fictitious payee rule states that the payee’s indorsement is not treated as a forgery and can be held liable by an innocent holder [UCC 3-404(b), 3-405].
If a maker or drawer issues an instrument to such a party, the loss generally falls on them rather than the third party that accepts it or the bank that cashes it.

:p How does the fictitious payee rule affect liability?
??x
The fictitious payee rule means that even if a non-existent person or entity is named as the payee, their indorsement is not considered forgery. An innocent holder can hold the maker or drawer liable for the instrument's value.

#### Example 27.15
Background context: Jen Nilson steals a check from Universal Bank and indorses it in Inga Leed’s name. The bank, without asking for identification, pays the check, and Nilson disappears. Since the indorsement is forged, Leed would not be liable on the check.

:p Who bears the loss according to this example?
??x
The loss falls on Universal Bank because the indorsement was forged, and they did not ask for proper identification.

#### Example 27.16
Background context: Carol impersonates Donna and tricks Edward into writing a check payable to Donna. Carol then negotiates the check with First National Bank as payment for her loan. Edward is liable for the amount of the check, but if the bank failed to use due care when cashing it, Edward may recover some loss from First National.

:p How does comparative negligence apply in Example 27.16?
??x
Comparative negligence applies here, meaning that if the bank failed to exercise ordinary care when taking the check from Carol, Edward (the drawer) might be able to recover a portion of his loss from First National Bank.

#### Maker or Drawer’s Intent Matters
Background context: The key concept is that the maker or drawer's intent at the time of issuing an instrument can determine whether an imposter's indorsement is treated as unauthorized. If they believed the imposter to be the real payee, the indorsement can be effective.

:p What role does the maker’s or drawer’s intent play in determining liability?
??x
The maker’s or drawer’s intent is crucial because if they believed the imposter was actually the named payee when issuing the instrument, the imposter's indorsement can be considered valid and not a forgery. This means that an innocent holder could hold the maker or drawer liable.

#### Liability, Defenses, and Discharge
Background context: This section discusses the warranties that apply to instruments under Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). It covers warranties from warrantors to transferees or holders, as well as presentment warranties made by those presenting an instrument for payment. The text also outlines limitations on these warranties and defenses against collection.

:p What are the key warranties given by a warrantor to a transferee or holder?
??x
The key warranties given by a warrantor to a transferee or holder include:
1. Notifying the warrantor of the breach within 30 days after discovering it.
2. The transferee or holder can recover damages equal to the loss suffered, but not more than the amount of the instrument.
3. Damages can also cover expenses and lost interest caused by the breach.

These warranties cannot be disclaimed for checks, as banks rely on them in the check-collection process.

#### Presentment Warranties
Background context: These warranties apply to anyone presenting an instrument for payment or acceptance. They include specific assurances about the validity of the transaction, such as the authenticity of signatures and the absence of alterations.

:p What are the three presentment warranties that a person must make when presenting an instrument?
??x
1. The person obtaining payment or acceptance is entitled to enforce the instrument or authorized to obtain payment or acceptance on behalf of a person who is entitled to enforce the instrument.
2. The instrument has not been altered.
3. The person obtaining payment or acceptance has no knowledge that the signature of the drawer of the instrument is unauthorized.

These warranties are known as presentment warranties because they protect the person to whom the instrument is presented and can shift liability back to the party best positioned to prevent wrongdoing.

#### Limitations on Presentment Warranties
Background context: The second and third presentment warranties do not apply to makers, acceptors, and drawers. It assumes that a drawer or maker will recognize their own signature and that a maker or acceptor will recognize any material alterations.

:p Which parties are exempt from the second and third presentment warranties?
??x
Makers, acceptors, and drawers are exempt from the second and third presentment warranties. This is because it is assumed that:
1. A drawer or maker can recognize their own signature.
2. A maker or acceptor would recognize if an instrument has been materially altered.

These parties have a better understanding of the signatures involved and potential alterations to the instruments.

#### Defenses Against Collection
Background context: This section outlines certain defenses that can bar collection from persons who would otherwise be liable on an instrument. These are categorized into universal defenses (applicable to all) and personal defenses (limited in application).

:p What is a defense that can be valid against ordinary holders but not against holders in due course?
??x
A breach of contract, including the breach of contract warranties, is a defense that can be valid against ordinary holders but not against holders in due course.

This means that if an instrument breaches any contract warranties, it cannot bar collection from a holder who took the instrument in good faith and without notice.

#### Negotiable Instruments and Consumer Credit Contracts
Background context: This section discusses negotiable instruments resulting from consumer credit contracts. It explains that such an instrument, if containing a required notice or similar statement, remains negotiable but limits certain defenses against holders. However, FTC Rule 433 allows third parties to purchase these notes without being subject to the buyer’s defenses.
:p What is the status of an instrument resulting from a consumer credit contract?
??x
An instrument that contains a required notice or similar statement remains negotiable. If it lacks this notice but is purchased by a third party, that third party generally cannot use the seller's defenses against the holder.

#### Discharge Through Payment or Tender
Background context: This concept outlines how parties are discharged from liability on an instrument through payment or tender of payment. The full amount due must be paid to a holder by the primarily liable party for all subsequent parties to be discharged, and the payer retains rights against prior parties.
:p How does payment discharge liability on a negotiable instrument?
??x
When the party primarily liable pays the full amount due to a holder, all parties are discharged. If any other party (like an indorser) makes such a payment, only that party's liability is discharged, but they can still recover from prior parties.
x??

#### Good Faith in Payment Discharge
Background context: This section explains that payment will not discharge the payer if it is made in bad faith, specifically when the holder acquired the instrument by theft. It also mentions an amendment that addresses the issue of transfers without notice to obligated parties.
:p What happens if a payment is made knowingly and in bad faith?
??x
If a party makes a payment knowingly and in bad faith (e.g., paying a thief), it will not be discharged from liability on the instrument, even though the holder may have acquired it improperly.
x??

#### Amendment to UCC 3–305(e)
Background context: This amendment closes a loophole by making third parties who hold notes or instruments without required notices subject to seller’s defenses. It affects states that have not adopted this amendment.
:p What does the amendment to UCC 3–305(e) do?
??x
The amendment makes third-party holders in possession of notes or other instruments that should include a required notice subject to the buyer's defenses against the seller, even if those notices are missing. This applies unless the state has not adopted the amendment.
x??

#### Discharge by Tender of Payment
Background context: In situations where payment is tendered but refused, the rights of indorsers and accommodation parties can be impaired. If the tender is made in good faith, it discharges them up to the amount of the tender.
:p What happens if a tender of payment is refused?
??x
If a tender (offer) of payment is made and refused, indorsers and accommodation parties are discharged to the extent of the amount offered, even though they may not receive the actual payment. This discharge affects their right to seek reimbursement from prior parties.
x??

#### Transfer Without Notice and Payment Discharge
Background context: Under an amendment to UCC 3–602(b), a party can be discharged if it pays another who transferred the instrument without giving notice, as long as that transferor was not acting as a holder in due course (HDC).
:p How does a payment after a transfer without notice affect discharge?
??x
When a party entitled to enforce an instrument transfers it without notice and one of the obligated parties pays the transferor, this payment can effectively discharge the payer up to the amount paid. However, if the payee has the rights of an HDC, this rule does not apply.
