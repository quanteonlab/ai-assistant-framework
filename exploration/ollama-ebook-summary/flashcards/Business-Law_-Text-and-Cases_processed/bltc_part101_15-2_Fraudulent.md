**Starting Chapter:** 15-2 Fraudulent Misrepresentation

---

---
#### Contracts and E-Contracts
Background context: When parties form a contract, their agreement establishes the value of the object of their transaction—initially. Each party is considered to have assumed the risk that the value will change in the future or prove to be different from what he or she thought.
If there were no such rule, almost any party who did not receive what they considered a fair bargain could argue mistake.
:p What does this passage explain about contracts and their formation?
??x
This passage explains that when parties form a contract, their agreement initially establishes the value of the transaction. Each party assumes the risk that future circumstances might change the perceived value or accuracy of the agreed-upon terms. Without such a rule, any party who did not receive what they considered fair could argue mistake.

#### Fraudulent Misrepresentation
Background context: When an innocent party is fraudulently induced to enter into a contract, the contract usually can be avoided because that party has not voluntarily consented to its terms. The innocent party can either rescind the contract and be restored to their original position or enforce the contract and seek damages.
Fraudulent misrepresentation refers only to misrepresentations that are consciously false and intended to mislead another. The person making the fraudulent misrepresentation knows or believes that the assertion is false or has no basis for the assertion.
:p What does this passage explain about fraudulent misrepresentation?
??x
This passage explains that when an innocent party enters into a contract due to fraud, the contract can typically be avoided because the consent was not truly voluntary. The innocent party may either rescind the contract and return to their original position or enforce it but seek damages for any harm caused by the fraud.
Fraudulent misrepresentation involves intentionally false statements made with the intent to deceive another party, where the person making the statement knows it is false or lacks a factual basis.

#### Merger Clause
Background context: A merger clause in a contract states that the contract embodies the entire agreement between the parties and no separate agreements are to be considered in interpreting the contract. This can affect the interpretation of claims, such as insurance policies, where the terms of the policy are comprehensive.
In the given case, Allstate Property and Casualty Insurance Company issued a policy to Jerry McCullough, insuring his pickup truck. When the truck was damaged by an acquaintance, Allstate treated multiple damages as separate claims (each with a $250 deductible) and reported these claims to Verisk Analytics A-PLUS.
:p How does a merger clause affect contract interpretation?
??x
A merger clause in a contract states that the agreement contained within is comprehensive and no additional agreements are considered when interpreting the terms. This can limit the scope of claims or disputes, as it indicates that all understandings were formalized in writing.

In this case, Allstate’s policy included a merger clause, meaning any separate agreements made outside the written policy would not be considered in interpreting the coverage.

#### Misrepresentation of Law
Misrepresentation of law generally does not allow a party to avoid a contract. Courts assume that parties are aware of local laws and regulations.

:p What happens when there is a misrepresentation about legal facts?
??x
In most cases, if one party makes a false statement regarding the law, the other party cannot typically avoid or void the contract because it's assumed they were aware of relevant legal standards. However, this may not hold if the misleading party is in a profession that requires greater knowledge than an average person.

#### Selleck v. Cuenca
This case serves as an exception to the general rule where misrepresentation by law does not void a contract. It highlights scenarios where professionals like lawyers or real estate brokers may be held to higher standards.

:p In what situation might Camara's statement in Example 15.7 be considered fraudulent?
??x
If Camara had been a lawyer or real estate broker, her intentional misrepresentation about the zoning laws could have constituted fraud due to her professional duty to know such regulations.
x??

---

#### Misrepresentation by Silence
Courts usually do not enforce silence unless it involves a duty to disclose important facts. This is relevant in business transactions and contracts.

:p When does a seller have a legal obligation to speak?
??x
A seller has a duty to speak if they know about significant issues that the buyer cannot reasonably detect on their own, such as latent defects. Additionally, under certain relationships (like partners or attorney-client), there's an inherent duty to disclose material facts.
x??

#### Jim is Selling a Car
This example illustrates how a seller does not have to disclose all information unless specifically asked.

:p How can a seller be held liable for misrepresentation by silence?
??x
A seller may be held liable if they make false statements or fail to correct misinformation, even if not explicitly required to speak. For instance, lying about car repairs after being asked can constitute fraud.
x??

---

#### Intent to Deceive (Scienter)
Fraud involves intentional deception through false statements.

:p What must the misrepresenting party have for their actions to be considered fraudulent?
??x
The misrepresenting party must exhibit intent to deceive. This is known as scienter, meaning they knew that the statement was false at the time it was made.
x??

---

#### Example 15.9 - Richard Wright's Case
This example shows how a clear intent to deceive can lead to contract rescission.

:p Can the school in Example 15.9 be held liable for dismissing Richard Wright?
??x
No, because Wright intentionally deceived the school by not disclosing his criminal history on his resume. The school acted within its rights by firing him based on this misrepresentation.

#### Background on Property Inspection and Reliance
Cronkelton, a potential buyer of a property, contacted Shivley regarding the winterization of the car wash. Shivley assured Cronkelton that the property would be properly winterized to prevent freezing damage. However, it turned out that the property was not adequately prepared for freezing temperatures.
:p What motivated Cronkelton's initial contact with Shivley about the car wash's winterization?
??x
Cronkelton contacted Shivley because he expected freezing temperatures and was concerned about the potential damage to the property. He expressed that if the property wasn't properly winterized, he wouldn't be interested in purchasing it.
x??

---

#### Winterization Assurances and Follow-up Actions
Shivley provided Cronkelton with an email detailing the winterization process and promised that all necessary steps would be taken to protect the property from freezing. However, subsequent events showed that these assurances were not fully realized.
:p What did Shivley promise in his December 7th email?
??x
In his December 7th email, Shivley guaranteed that Guaranteed Construction Services would winterize the car wash by putting antifreeze and securing floor heating, blowing out water from self-serve bays and emptying tanks. He also mentioned leaving minimal heat on in the pump room.
x??

---

#### Discrepancy Between Assurances and Reality
Despite Shivley’s assurances, the property suffered significant damage due to freezing after the purchase. This discrepancy between expectations and reality is a key point of contention.
:p What evidence did Cronkelton find when he inspected the property?
??x
When Cronkelton inspected the property in June after closing on it, he found that canisters had exploded from the top being blown off, and pipes were damaged due to freezing. This indicated extensive damage caused by freezing temperatures despite Shivley’s assurances.
x??

---

#### Availability of Information Before Purchase
Cronkelton had the opportunity to inspect the property prior to purchasing and could have done so again before finalizing the deal. The issue was whether he unjustifiably relied on Shivley's statements about the condition of the property.
:p Did Cronkelton actually inspect the property after November 2009, and if not, why?
??x
Cronkelton did not inspect the property again after November 2009 because Shivley's email provided enough assurance that he believed no further inspection was necessary. He trusted Shivley’s claim that the property would be properly winterized.
x??

---

#### Role of Shivley and Guaranteed Construction Services
Shivley, as a receiver, was responsible for ensuring proper maintenance and preparation of the property. However, he did not share information about potential issues with the heating system or the building's design limitations.
:p What actions did Guaranteed Construction Services take after receiving the memo from Strayer Company?
??x
After receiving the memo, Guaranteed Construction Services did not follow through with the recommendations to keep the heat on. This resulted in the property being inadequately prepared for freezing temperatures and subsequent damage.
x??

---

#### Legal Implications of Reliance
The case hinges on whether Cronkelton's reliance on Shivley’s statements was justified given his opportunity to inspect the property multiple times.
:p Was Cronkelton's reliance on Shivley’s assurances about the car wash's condition reasonable?
??x
Cronkelton's reliance may have been reasonable given that he trusted Shivley's email and did not have reason to suspect problems after receiving the detailed winterization plan. However, his decision was ultimately based on trust in Shivley’s representations rather than independent verification.

#### Online Fraudulent Misrepresentation Actionability
Online fraudulent misrepresentation involves creating a fictitious persona on the internet and making false claims that cause emotional or financial harm to the victim. The legal system has been challenged to address this issue, with limited success.

Background context: Te’o's case involved a fake girlfriend, Lennay Kekua, who was said to have died in a tragic accident. This led to an investigation and ultimately, a claim of catfishing fraud. Other cases like Paula Bonhomme’s highlight the difficulties in bringing lawsuits for emotional distress caused by such impersonations.

:p Under what circumstances might a person be able to collect damages for fraudulent misrepresentation involving online impersonation?
??x
In the context of online fraudulent misrepresentation, a person may be able to collect damages if they can prove that:
1. There was a false representation made.
2. The victim relied on this false representation.
3. The reliance caused actual injury (emotional or financial).
4. There is no clear legal framework in many jurisdictions that supports such claims.

The Illinois Supreme Court's ruling in Bonhomme’s case sets a precedent where purely personal relationships without commercial components do not typically meet the requirements for fraudulent misrepresentation lawsuits.

For example, if someone created an online persona to deceive another into sending them money or gifts, and this caused significant financial harm, it might be easier to prove actionable damages.
x??

---

#### Legal Frameworks on Online Impersonation
There are laws in some states that make impersonating someone online a crime. However, these laws generally do not apply to those who create fictional personas.

Background context: Te’o claimed he was victimized by catfishing and suggested his friends created the persona of Lennay Kekua for inspirational purposes. Some argued it could have been an attempt to boost his chances of winning the Heisman trophy. Laws in some states specifically address impersonation, but they typically do not cover completely fictional personas.

:p How do state laws on impersonating someone online affect catfishing cases?
??x
State laws that make impersonating someone online a crime usually focus on those who falsely represent themselves as another person with the intent to deceive. However, these laws generally do not apply to scenarios where entirely fictitious personas are created for no specific fraudulent purpose.

For instance, if Te’o's friends had simply created Lennay Kekua as an invention without any intent to defraud, it might be difficult to charge them under such state laws.

#### Legal Actions in Catfishing Cases
Victims of catfishing have attempted legal action but often face difficulties. Courts generally dismiss these suits for lack of proof of actual injury or commercial component.

Background context: Paula Bonhomme's case is a notable example where she sued after developing an emotional relationship with someone who turned out to be fictitious. Despite suffering significant emotional distress and financial loss, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled that she could not bring a suit because there was no "business dealings" involved.

:p What challenges do victims face when attempting legal action for catfishing?
??x
Victims of catfishing often struggle with proving actionable damages in court due to several factors:
1. **Lack of Commercial Component**: Many cases involve purely personal relationships without any commercial, transactional, or regulatory component.
2. **Emotional Distress vs. Damages**: Emotional distress alone is generally not enough to prove actionable damages unless it results in significant financial harm.
3. **Difficulties in Proving Fraudulent Intent**: Establishing fraudulent intent can be challenging, especially when the impersonation does not involve any direct financial gain.

For example, Bonhomme’s case highlighted that courts require proof of actual injury beyond emotional distress to support a claim for fraudulent misrepresentation.

#### Recent Legal Developments
Recent legal cases have seen some progress in addressing online impersonation. For instance, Herrick v. Grindr and Beckman v. Match.com LLC provide new avenues for recovery.

Background context: These recent cases involve individuals who suffered from online impersonations through dating apps and websites. The courts are increasingly considering the emotional and financial harm caused by such impersonations.

:p What recent legal developments have affected catfishing lawsuits?
??x
Recent legal developments, such as Herrick v. Grindr LLC (306 F. Supp. 3d 579) and Beckman v. Match.com LLC (668 Fed. Appx. 759; 2017 WL 1424899), have shown that victims of online impersonation may now have more grounds to pursue legal action, even if the relationship was purely personal.

These cases suggest that courts are beginning to recognize the broader impact of online impersonations, particularly when they lead to significant emotional and financial distress. However, these developments do not guarantee success in all cases; each case still requires careful consideration of the specific facts and circumstances.

#### Fraud and Misrepresentation
Background context: The provided text discusses a case where Cypress allegedly made misrepresentations that did not negatively affect the property's value at the time of purchase. The trial court and state intermediate appellate court ruled in favor of the defendant, as the jury found no damages.
:p Was Cypress’s conduct unethical? Why or why not?
??x
Cypress's conduct might be seen as unethical because it involved making a misrepresentation that did not harm Fazio financially at the time of purchase. However, if the misrepresentation was material and could have potentially affected the property value in the future (even if it didn't), Cypress may still face ethical scrutiny for misleading Fazio.

#### Undue Influence in Commercial Real Estate Transactions
Background context: The text introduces the concept of undue influence, explaining that a contract entered into under excessive or undue influence lacks voluntary consent and is therefore voidable. It provides specific examples like guardianship relationships where one party can dominate another.
:p What does the decision in this case suggest to sellers of commercial real estate and others who engage in business negotiations?
??x
The decision suggests that sellers and negotiators must be cautious, especially when dealing with vulnerable parties such as minors or the elderly. They should ensure that all transactions are entered into freely without any undue influence. If a guardian or someone in a fiduciary relationship benefits financially from a contract, it may lead to legal challenges based on undue influence.
??x
---

---
#### Presumption of Undue Influence
Background context: The text explains that when the dominant party in a fiduciary relationship benefits from that relationship, a presumption of undue influence arises. This means the court will often presume that the contract was made under undue influence unless evidence is provided to rebut this presumption.
:p What happens if Kinsley challenges the contract entered by Erik as guardian for his financial benefit?
??x
If Kinsley challenges the contract, the court will likely presume that Erik (the guardian) has exerted undue influence. To rebut this presumption, Erik must show full disclosure to Kinsley, presence of consideration, and that Kinsley received independent and competent advice before entering into the transaction.
??x

---
#### Economic Duress
Background context: The agreement between Eyman and Weller might be unenforceable because of economic duress. Eyman threatened to withdraw his services, which he was legally entitled to do, but did so two days before the IRS deadline. At that late date, it would have been impossible for Weller to obtain adequate representation elsewhere.

:p What is economic duress?
??x
Economic duress occurs when one party threatens to use their economic power to force another party into an agreement against their will. In this case, Eyman threatened to withdraw his services unless Weller agreed to the terms of a contract. The threat was made just two days before the IRS deadline, making it impossible for Weller to find alternative representation.

x??

---
#### Adhesion Contracts
Background context: Adhesion contracts are those where one party has overwhelming bargaining power and dictates all the terms, leaving the other party with no choice but to accept or forfeit the commodity or service. These contracts often use standard forms with fine-print provisions that shift risks from one party to another.

:p What is an adhesion contract?
??x
An adhesion contract is a standard-form contract where the terms are dictated by one party, usually due to their overwhelming bargaining power, leaving no room for negotiation. The signer must accept all the terms or forego the opportunity to obtain the service or commodity in question. These contracts typically use pre-prepared forms that do not allow the adhering party to negotiate the terms.

x??

---
#### Unconscionability
Background context: Unconscionability refers to situations where a contract is so unfair or one-sided that it is oppressive and unenforceable. Courts may find a contract unconscionable if it involves a significant imbalance in bargaining power, fine-print provisions that shift risks, or other such factors.

:p What does unconscionability mean?
??x
Unconscionability means that a contract's terms are so unfair or one-sided that they can be considered oppressive and unenforceable. This concept is often applied to standard-form contracts where the terms are dictated by a party with overwhelming bargaining power, and the other party has no real choice but to accept them.

#### Case in Point 15.16: Gregory and Stephanie Smith
Background context: The Smiths bought a house built by D. R. Horton, Inc., which came with a standard purchase agreement containing an arbitration clause and limited liability provisions. After discovering defects, the Smiths sued Horton for various claims. The court found that the arbitration clause was unconscionable due to its oppressive nature.

:p What issue did the Smiths face with their contract?
??x
The Smiths faced issues related to a standard-form contract containing an arbitration clause and limited liability provisions. These terms were included in a "Warranties and Dispute Resolution Section" of the agreement, which the court deemed unconscionable due to its oppressive nature.

x??

---
#### Unconscionability in Courts
Background context: Technically, unconscionability under Section 2-302 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) only applies to contracts for the sale of goods. However, many courts have expanded this concept to apply in other situations as well.

:p What is the scope of unconscionability?
??x
Unconscionability traditionally applies to contracts for the sale of goods under Section 2-302 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). However, due to judicial expansion, it can also be applied to other types of contracts. Courts consider factors such as significant imbalance in bargaining power and oppressive terms when determining unconscionability.

x??

---

---
#### Adhesion Contracts
Adhesion contracts are standard form contracts that are drafted by one party and presented to the other for acceptance or rejection without negotiation. These contracts are typically used when one party has a significantly greater bargaining power than the other, such as between a consumer and a business.

:p What is an adhesion contract?
??x
An adhesion contract is a standard form contract that lacks meaningful negotiation because it is drafted by one party (usually a powerful entity like a corporation) for general use. The other party has little to no ability to negotiate the terms, which often leads to significant imbalance in the agreement.
x??
---

---
#### Bilateral Mistake
Bilateral mistake occurs when both parties to a contract are mistaken about a fact that is material to the agreement's validity or enforceability.

:p What is a bilateral mistake?
??x
A bilateral mistake happens when both parties have incorrect information regarding a critical fact, and this mistake affects the mutual consent necessary for a valid contract. For example, if both parties mistakenly believe an item’s value to be $100 but its actual value is$1,000, their agreement might be voidable due to the misrepresentation of that fact.
x??
---

---
#### Duress
Duress involves compelling one party to enter into a contract by force or threat, rendering the consent obtained non-voluntary.

:p What is duress in the context of contracts?
??x
Duress occurs when one party enters into a contract under pressure from another party who uses force or threats to ensure compliance. This can invalidate the agreement as it affects the voluntary nature of the consent given.
x??
---

---
#### Innocent Misrepresentation
Innocent misrepresentation happens when a party makes a false statement of fact without knowing that it is untrue, and this leads to the other party entering into a contract.

:p What constitutes innocent misrepresentation in contracts?
??x
Innocent misrepresentation occurs when one party makes a false statement believing it to be true, which influences the other party's decision to enter into a contract. This can potentially void the agreement if the mistake is significant enough.
x??
---

---
#### Latent Defects
Latent defects refer to hidden flaws or problems in property or goods that are not apparent from an ordinary inspection but become evident over time.

:p What are latent defects?
??x
Latent defects are hidden imperfections or issues within a property or item that cannot be discovered through normal inspection. These defects may only manifest after some use or time has passed, making them particularly problematic in sales agreements.
x??
---

---
#### Negligent Misrepresentation
Negligent misrepresentation occurs when one party provides false information without the intention to deceive but with a lack of due diligence.

:p What is negligent misrepresentation?
??x
Negligent misrepresentation happens when a party makes a false statement without intent to deceive, but through a failure to check their information thoroughly. This can void a contract if the misinformation significantly affects the other party's decision-making.
x??
---

---
#### Scienter
Scienter refers to knowledge or awareness of wrongdoing by one party.

:p What is scienter in the context of contracts?
??x
Scienter involves having knowledge or being aware of wrongdoing, such as making false statements with intent. In legal terms, it often pertains to fraudulent conduct where a party knowingly provides inaccurate information.
x??
---

---
#### Unilateral Mistake
Unilateral mistake occurs when only one party to the contract is mistaken about a material fact that affects their decision-making.

:p What is a unilateral mistake?
??x
A unilateral mistake happens when only one party holds an incorrect belief regarding a material fact, which influences their decision to enter into a contract. The other party may or may not be aware of this misperception.
x??
---

---
#### Undue Influence
Undue influence occurs when one party exerts significant pressure on another to enter into a contract against their will.

:p What is undue influence in the context of contracts?
??x
Undue influence happens when one party pressures or coerces another, exploiting a relationship where trust and dependency exist. This can invalidate a contract as it undermines voluntary consent.
x??
---

---
#### Voluntary Consent
Voluntary consent means both parties agree to an agreement without any duress or coercion.

:p What is voluntary consent in contracts?
??x
Voluntary consent refers to the situation where both parties freely enter into an agreement, with neither being subjected to force or undue influence. This is a fundamental requirement for a valid contract.
