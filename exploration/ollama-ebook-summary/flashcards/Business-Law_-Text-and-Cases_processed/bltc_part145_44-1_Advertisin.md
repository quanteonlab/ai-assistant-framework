#### Different Requirements for Products Intended for Young Children
Background context: The National Labeling and Education Act (NLEA) sets specific requirements for products intended for children under four years old. One such requirement is that these products cannot declare the percentage of daily value of nutritional components on their labels.

:p Does it make sense to have different requirements for products intended for young children under four years old?
??x
It makes sense to have different requirements because children at this age are more vulnerable and may not understand the implications of nutritional content as adults do. Ensuring that labels are clear and simple can help parents make better-informed decisions about their child's diet.

For example, if a product claims it has 30% of the daily value of vitamins, a young child might misunderstand this to mean the product is healthy overall, which could be misleading or harmful.

```java
public class LabelRequirements {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Simulate checking if a label meets NLEA requirements for children under four.
        boolean isUnderFour = true;
        String nutrientLabel = "30% DV";
        
        if (isUnderFour && nutrientLabel.contains("%")) {
            System.out.println("This product does not meet the NLEA requirements.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("This product meets the NLEA requirements for older children.");
        }
    }
}
```

#### Deceptive Advertising in Light Cigarettes
Background context: Brian Cleary and Rita Burke filed a lawsuit against Philip Morris USA, Inc., claiming that "light" cigarettes were advertised as safer than regular cigarettes when they are not. The plaintiffs argued the tobacco companies concealed the true nature of light cigarettes.

:p Should the plaintiffs still be able to bring a deceptive advertising claim against the tobacco company?
??x
Yes, the plaintiffs can bring a deceptive advertising claim because even if Philip Morris was authorized by the government to advertise their products, that authorization does not protect them from claims of deceptive practices. Consumers have the right to truthful and accurate information regarding their purchases.

```java
public class AdvertisingClaim {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        boolean isDeceptive = true;

#### Fair Debt-Collection Practices
Background context: Bank of America hired Atlantic Resource Management, LLC, to collect a debt from Michael E. Engler. The collector called his employer and asked about the company's policy concerning warrants, leading Engler to fear arrest.

:p Can Engler recover under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act?
??x
Yes, Engler can recover under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) because Atlantic Resource Management’s actions caused him emotional distress and discomfort at work. The FDCPA prohibits collectors from using abusive, oppressive, or threatening means to collect a debt.

```java
public class DebtCollection {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        boolean causesEmotionalDistress = true;
        String collectorAction = "Called Engler’s employer about warrants and threatened legal action.";
        
        if (causesEmotionalDistress && collectorAction.contains("threatened")) {
            System.out.println("Engler can recover under the FDCPA.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("There may be no basis for recovery based on the actions described.");
        }
    }
}

#### Deceptive Advertising with Scareware
Background context: Innovative Marketing, Inc. (IMI) sold "scareware" – computer security software that falsely claimed to have detected dangerous files, viruses, and illegal pornography. IMI’s cofounder and vice president, Kristy Ross, reviewed and edited these ads.

:p Were IMI's ads deceptive?
??x
Yes, IMI's ads were deceptive because they falsely claimed the presence of dangerous files without conducting any actual scans. The ads were designed to scare users into purchasing the software, which is a form of deception.

Kristy Ross can be held liable because she participated directly in the creation and approval of these false advertisements and had knowledge of the complaints from consumers.

```java
public class DeceptiveAdvertising {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        boolean wasDeceptive = true;
        String adContent = "Scan detected dangerous files, viruses, and illegal pornography.";
        
        if (wasDeceptive && adContent.contains("detected")) {
            System.out.println("IMI's ads were deceptive.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("There may be no basis for the claim of deception based on the provided information.");
        }
    }
}
```
