#### Territorial and Customer Restrictions
Background context: Manufacturers may impose territorial or customer restrictions on dealers to prevent certain practices, such as reselling products to competing retailers. These restrictions can have a legitimate purpose but are no longer considered per se violations of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.

Judged under the rule of reason, meaning courts consider the specific facts and circumstances of each case rather than automatically deeming them illegal.
:p What is the primary way territorial and customer restrictions are judged today?
??x
Territorial and customer restrictions are now judged under the rule of reason. This means that courts will examine the specific details and context of the situation to determine whether these restrictions are harmful or beneficial, instead of treating them as automatically illegal.

For example, in the Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc. case (1977), the Supreme Court found that vertical franchise systems, which were not price restrictive, did not constitute a per se violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.

#### Case in Point: Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc.
Background context: This case involved an electronics manufacturer (GTE Sylvania) that limited retail franchises to prevent competition from other retailers.

The Court ruled that vertical restrictions can promote interbrand competition by allowing manufacturers to achieve certain efficiencies in product distribution. In this specific case, the restriction did not result in a per se violation because it was not price restrictive.
:p What was the outcome of the Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc. case?
??x
The Supreme Court ruled that vertical restrictions can promote interbrand competition and are no longer considered per se violations of Section 1 of the Sherman Act if they are not price restrictive.

Specifically, in the Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc. case (1977), GTE Sylvania's practice of limiting retail franchises was deemed legal because it did not constitute a per se violation; instead, it was evaluated under the rule of reason.

#### Resale Price Maintenance Agreements
Background context: Resale price maintenance agreements involve manufacturers setting specific retail prices for their products. These agreements were once considered per se violations but are now judged under the rule of reason.

Maximum resale price maintenance can sometimes increase competition and benefit consumers by preventing retailers from engaging in unfair pricing practices.
:p What is a resale price maintenance agreement?
??x
A resale price maintenance agreement is an arrangement between a manufacturer and its distributors or retailers where the manufacturer dictates what retail prices these entities must charge for their products.

Historically, such agreements were considered per se violations of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. However, today, both maximum and minimum resale price maintenance agreements are evaluated under the rule of reason.

#### Rule of Reason Application
Background context: Under the rule of reason, courts analyze whether a restriction or agreement is harmful to competition. This approach allows for more nuanced decision-making compared to the per se violations of earlier times.

The key aspect of the rule of reason is that it considers the specific circumstances and impacts of each case rather than applying a blanket prohibition.
:p How does the rule of reason apply to vertical restraints?
??x
The rule of reason applies by examining whether a particular vertical restraint, such as territorial or customer restrictions, promotes competition or harms consumers.

For instance, in the Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc. case (1977), the Supreme Court found that vertical franchise systems were not per se illegal because they promoted interbrand competition and did not result in price fixing.

#### DuPont's Market Dominance and Monopolization Claims
DuPont manufactures and sells para-aramid fiber, a synthetic fiber used for various applications including body armor, fiber-optic cables, and tires. The market is dominated by three companies: DuPont (U.S.), Teijin (Netherlands), and Kolon Industries (Korea). DuPont has at times held 60% of the U.S. para-aramid fiber market.
:p What case was brought against DuPont for monopolization?
??x
DuPont was sued by Kolon for theft and misappropriation of trade secrets, to which DuPont counterclaimed that Kolon had attempted to monopolize the U.S. para-aramid market in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act.

#### Relevant Market Definition: Product and Geographic Components
To determine whether a firm has monopoly power, it is necessary to define the relevant market, which consists of two elements:
1. **Relevant Product Market**: This includes all products that are identical or reasonably interchangeable with each other. Products are considered reasonably interchangeable if consumers treat them as acceptable substitutes.
2. **Relevant Geographic Market**: This defines the geographic area within which the product is sold and competition occurs.

For example, in a monopolization case, the relevant market might be defined narrowly to show greater market power.
:p What factors determine whether a firm has monopoly power?
??x
A firm's monopoly power can be determined by defining the relevant product and geographic markets. If a firm controls a significant portion of an appropriately defined market, it may have monopoly power.
x??

---
#### Example: Relevant Product Market in Monopolization Cases
In this example, White Whale Apps acquired Spring-leaf Apps, its main competitor. The FTC argued that the relevant product market should consist of retailers selling only apps for Android mobile phones, rather than all online retailers of mobile phone apps.

This narrower definition allowed the FTC to assert that White Whale had a dominant share of the market.
:p How did the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) argue the relevant product market in the White Whale Apps case?
??x
The FTC argued that the relevant product market should include only retailers selling apps for Android mobile phones, not all online retailers of mobile phone apps. This narrower definition allowed the FTC to claim that White Whale had a dominant share of the relevant market.

#### Monopolization Case: U.S. Producer of Ductile Iron Pipe Fittings
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) alleged that the leading U.S. producer of domestic ductile iron pipe fittings was seeking to maintain monopoly power in violation of antitrust law.

This case highlights the importance of defining the relevant market correctly, as it can significantly impact whether a firm is seen to have monopoly power.
:p What did the FTC allege against the leading U.S. producer of ductile iron pipe fittings?
??x
The FTC alleged that the leading U.S. producer of domestic ductile iron pipe fittings was attempting to maintain monopoly power in violation of antitrust law.

#### Relevant Geographic Market
Background context: The geographic extent of a market is a crucial component in defining the relevant market. For products sold nationwide, the geographic boundaries can encompass the entire United States. However, if transportation costs are significant or the firm and its competitors sell only in a limited area where customers have no access to other sources of the product, then the geographic market is limited to that specific region.

:p What determines the geographic extent of the relevant market for a product?
??x
The determination is based on whether transportation costs make it prohibitive for customers to seek products from outside the region or if the firm and competitors operate in a limited area with no easy access to alternatives.
x??

---
#### Intent Requirement in Monopolization Cases
Background context: Monopoly power alone does not constitute an offense under Section 2 of the Sherman Act. The offense also requires an intent to monopolize. A dominant market share can be achieved through good business judgment, superior product development, or historical accident without violating antitrust laws.

:p What is required for a firm to violate Section 2 of the Sherman Act in terms of intent?
??x
For a firm to violate Section 2 of the Sherman Act, it must not only have monopoly power but also engage in anticompetitive behavior with a purposeful act aimed at acquiring or maintaining that power.
x??

---
#### Unilateral Refusals to Deal
Background context: Joint refusals to deal (group boycotts) are subject to close scrutiny under Section 1 of the Sherman Act. However, unilateral refusals by a single manufacturer to deal with certain customers can also violate Section 2 if the firm has—or is likely to acquire—monopoly power and such a refusal is likely to have an anticompetitive effect on a particular market.

:p What conditions must be met for a unilateral refusal to deal to constitute a violation under Section 2 of the Sherman Act?
??x
A unilateral refusal to deal can violate Section 2 if:
1. The firm refusing to deal has—or is likely to acquire—monopoly power.
2. The refusal is likely to have an anticompetitive effect on a particular market.

#### Example: Clark Industries
Background context: This example illustrates how a firm with significant market share might engage in behavior that could be considered illegal under antitrust laws, depending on the intent behind its actions.

:p How does the example of Clark Industries fit into the concept of monopolization and anti-competitive behavior?
??x
Clark Industries owns three out of four major downhill ski areas in Blue Hills, Idaho. This dominance suggests potential market power. The question is whether any unilateral refusals or other actions taken by Clark Industries could be interpreted as an attempt to maintain this dominant position through anticompetitive means.

#### Cost Justification for Price Reduction
Background context: Sellers can avoid price discrimination liability by demonstrating that a particular buyer’s purchases saved the seller costs related to producing and selling goods. This justification is based on the principle that discounts are directly tied to cost-saving measures, ensuring fairness.

:p Can Rogue, Inc., avoid price discrimination charges if they can show that Mercury Marine offered discounts in good faith to save on production or distribution costs?
??x
If Rogue, Inc., can provide evidence that the discounts given by Mercury Marine were intended to reduce their own expenses related to manufacturing and selling outboard motors, then Mercury Marine could defend itself from a price discrimination lawsuit. The key here is that the discounts are linked to cost-saving measures rather than differential pricing based on customer characteristics or competitive conditions.

Example: Suppose Mercury Marine can show internal records indicating that they offer discounts only when there are direct savings in costs due to bulk purchasing or promotional activities, this could justify their actions.

#### Meeting Competitor’s Prices
Background context: Sellers may avoid price discrimination charges if they lower prices in good faith attempts to match equally low prices set by competitors. This is particularly relevant in competitive markets where firms must remain competitive.

:p If a seller lowers its price to meet a competitor's equally low price, under what circumstances can it defend against a price discrimination claim?
??x
A seller can defend against a price discrimination claim if they can show that the price reduction was made in good faith and as an attempt to compete with another firm offering similarly priced goods. The key here is demonstrating intent and not discriminatory pricing based on customer characteristics.

Example: A retailer lowers its price for a product because a competitor has started selling it at a lower cost. If the retailer can prove that this action was taken without any discriminatory motive, they may avoid liability.

#### Changing Market Conditions
Background context: Sellers are allowed to adjust prices in response to changing market conditions or the marketability of goods. This adjustment is justified as a reasonable business practice aimed at adapting to the current market realities.

:p Can a seller lower its price due to changes in technology that make a product less marketable?
??x
Yes, a seller can lower the price of a product if it is responding to changing market conditions such as advances in technology that make the product less desirable or more expensive to produce. This adjustment is considered a legitimate business practice and does not constitute price discrimination.

Example: If a new technology renders an old model of electronics obsolete and less marketable, the seller can reduce its price without facing price discrimination claims.

#### State Laws Concerning Price Discrimination
Background context: Some states have enacted statutes to prevent price discrimination. These laws may apply when goods or services are sold at different prices in different locations within a state. The laws often protect specific businesses like auto dealerships and also cover unfair competition practices.

:p How might state laws impact a business that sells goods at varying prices across its different locations?
??x
State laws can significantly impact businesses by prohibiting price discrimination based on geographic location or other non-competitive factors. For instance, if a state has an unfair competition law that prohibits discriminatory pricing, a business must ensure that it does not charge different prices for the same products in different regions of the state.

Example: If California’s UCL is violated because a dating app charges older users more than younger ones within the state, the business could face legal repercussions under state statutes.
```java
public class BusinessCompliance {
    public boolean checkPriceDiscrimination(double price1, double price2) {
        if (price1 != price2 && areLocationsSame(price1, price2)) {
            return true; // Potential price discrimination violation
        }
        return false;
    }

    private boolean areLocationsSame(double price1, double price2) {
        // Logic to check if the prices are being compared within the same state/region
        return true; 
    }
}
```

#### Candelore v. Tinder, Inc.
Background context: In this case, a court considered whether age-based pricing on a dating app violated civil rights and unfair competition statutes. The court concluded that such practices could be justified under public policies promoting vendor profit maximization.

:p Did the California Court of Appeal support Candelore's claim of age-based price discrimination against Tinder?
??x
No, the California Court of Appeal did not support Candelore’s claim. The court found that Tinder's age-based pricing model was justified by public policies that promote "profit maximization by the vendor," which is considered a legitimate goal in a capitalistic economy.

The key factor here is that the court deemed profit maximization as a valid business objective, thereby allowing companies like Tinder to set different prices based on customer characteristics under certain circumstances.

#### Horizontal Mergers
Background context: A horizontal merger involves firms that compete with each other in the same market. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) have established guidelines to determine if such a merger is legal or not, focusing on several factors.

Relevant formulas: One key factor is the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), which measures market concentration:
- HHI = Σ(i=1 to n) [s_i^2]
  where s_i is the market share of firm i and n is the number of firms in the relevant market.

Example code: The formula for calculating HHI.
```java
public class MarketConcentration {
    public static double calculateHHI(double[] marketShares) {
        double sum = 0;
        for (double share : marketShares) {
            sum += Math.pow(share, 2);
        }
        return sum * 10000; // HHI is usually scaled to a range of 0-10,000
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double[] shares = {35.4, 28.9, 7.6, 6.3, 4.8};
        System.out.println("HHI: " + calculateHHI(shares));
    }
}
```

:p What is a horizontal merger and what factors are considered in its legality?
??x
A horizontal merger involves firms that compete with each other in the same market. The legality of such a merger depends on several factors, including:
- Overall concentration of the relevant market.
- History of the market tending toward concentration.
- Whether the merger is designed to establish market power or restrict competition.

These factors help determine if the resulting entity from the merger has too much control over the market, potentially harming competition. The HHI formula is used to quantify market concentration.

#### Vertical Mergers
Background context: A vertical merger involves companies at different stages of production, such as a manufacturer merging with its supplier or retailer. The legality of a vertical merger depends on factors like whether it creates an entity that controls too large a share of the relevant market.

:p What is a vertical merger and what are some key considerations in determining its legality?
??x
A vertical merger involves companies at different stages of production, such as a manufacturer merging with its supplier or retailer. Key considerations include:
- Whether the merger creates a single firm that controls an undue percentage share of the relevant market.
- The concentration of firms in the market.
- Barriers to entry into the market.
- The apparent intent of the merging parties.

The courts also consider if the merger prevents competitors from competing effectively, which could be considered illegal under antitrust laws. For instance, if a manufacturer merges with its supplier, it might reduce competition among suppliers and limit choices for retailers and consumers.

#### Interlocking Directorates
Background context: Section 8 of the Clayton Act addresses interlocking directorates, where individuals serve as directors on the boards of two or more competing companies simultaneously. This practice can lead to conflicts of interest and potential anti-competitive behavior.

Relevant formulas: There is no specific formula mentioned in the text, but the threshold for capital, surplus, profits, or competitive sales exceeding a certain amount is crucial.

:p What does Section 8 of the Clayton Act address, and what are the key thresholds?
??x
Section 8 of the Clayton Act deals with interlocking directorates—individuals serving as directors on the boards of two or more competing corporations simultaneously. The key threshold is that no person may be a director for two or more competing corporations at the same time if either corporation has:
- Capital, surplus, or competitive sales exceeding a specified threshold.
The Federal Trade Commission adjusts these threshold amounts each year to ensure they are relevant and enforceable.

For example, if a person serves on the board of directors of both Competing Corp A and B, and Competing Corp A's capital, surplus, or competitive sales exceed the threshold, it would be illegal for that individual to serve as a director in both companies.
