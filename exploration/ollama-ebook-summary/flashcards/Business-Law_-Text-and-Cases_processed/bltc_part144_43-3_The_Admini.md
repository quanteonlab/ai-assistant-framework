**Starting Chapter:** 43-3 The Administrative Process

---

---
#### Administrative Process Overview
The APA (Administrative Procedure Act) sets specific procedural requirements for federal agencies to follow when carrying out their three basic functions: rulemaking, enforcement, and adjudication. These procedures ensure that agencies act in a transparent and fair manner.

:p What does the Administrative Process involve?
??x
The Administrative Process involves rulemaking, enforcement, and adjudication. Rulemaking is the formulation of new regulations by federal agencies.
x??

---
#### Rulemaking Function
Rulemaking is a major function of administrative agencies where they create, amend, or remove rules. These rules are intended to implement, interpret, or prescribe law and policy.

:p What is the primary function of an administrative agency?
??x
The primary function of an administrative agency is rulemaking—the formulation of new regulations.
x??

---
#### APA Definition of a Rule
According to the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), a rule is defined as "an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law and policy."

:p What does the APA define a rule as?
??x
The APA defines a rule as an agency statement that is generally applicable, has future effects, and aims to implement, interpret, or prescribe laws and policies.
x??

---
#### Legislative Nature of Rules
Agency rules are sometimes described as legislative because they have binding effects similar to statutes. Violators can be punished for breaking these rules.

:p Why are agency rules considered legislative?
??x
Agency rules are considered legislative because they have a binding effect like statutes, meaning violators can face penalties.
x??

---
#### Procedural Requirements for Rulemaking
The APA establishes specific procedures that agencies must follow to create (amend or remove) rules. These include notice-and-comment rulemaking involving three steps: 1. Notice of the proposed rulemaking, 2. A comment period, and 3. The final rule.

:p What are the procedural requirements for creating a new rule?
??x
The APA requires agencies to follow procedures like notice-and-comment rulemaking, which involves publishing a notice, allowing a comment period, and then issuing the final rule.
x??

---
#### Notice of Proposed Rulemaking Procedure
When an agency decides on a new rule, it must publish a notice in the Federal Register. This notice includes details such as where and when proceedings will be held, legal authority for making the rule, and information about the proposed terms or subject matter.

:p What does the notice of proposed rulemaking include?
??x
The notice of proposed rulemaking includes the location and timing of hearings, the agency’s legal authority to make the rule, and details about the proposed terms or subject matter.
x??

---
#### Comment Period Details
After publishing a notice, the agency must allow sufficient time for public comment. This period is crucial as it gives interested parties the opportunity to express their views on the proposed rule.

:p What is the purpose of the comment period?
??x
The purpose of the comment period is to give interested parties an opportunity to express their views and influence the final rule.
x??

---
#### Final Rule Issuance
After reviewing comments, the agency issues a final rule. This step completes the notice-and-comment process.

:p What happens after the comment period ends?
??x
After reviewing the comments, the agency issues the final rule, completing the notice-and-comment process for creating or amending a rule.
x??

---
#### Petitions and Rulemaking Initiatives
The impetus for rulemaking can come from various sources, including Congress, the agency itself, or private parties who petition an agency to begin a rulemaking. Environmental groups have petitioned for stricter air-pollution controls.

:p How can new rules be initiated?
??x
New rules can be initiated by Congress, the agency itself, or through petitions from private parties like environmental groups.
x??

---
#### Federal Register Publication
The Federal Register is where federal agencies publish notices of proposed rulemaking. It also includes other government orders, rules, and regulations.

:p Where are notices of proposed rulemaking published?
??x
Notices of proposed rulemaking are published in the Federal Register, which is a daily publication that includes various government documents.
x??

---

---
#### Guidance Documents and Informal Agency Actions
Background context: The text explains that guidance documents issued by agencies advise the public on their legal and policy positions. These documents are not subject to the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) requirements because they do not establish legal rights for the regulated entities.

:p What is the primary purpose of guidance documents according to the text?
??x
Guidance documents serve to inform the public about an agency's legal and policy positions, providing clarity on how regulations might be interpreted or applied. They are not legally binding and do not create enforceable rights but can influence regulatory compliance.
x??

---
#### Enforcement by Agencies
Background context: The passage discusses various methods through which agencies enforce their rules, including investigations based on reports of violations, compliance reporting from regulated entities, and on-site inspections.

:p How does an agency typically start an enforcement investigation?
??x
An agency might initiate an enforcement investigation when it receives a report of a possible violation or when compliance reports from regulated entities trigger such an investigation.
x??

---
#### On-Site Inspections and Tests
Background context: The text explains that on-site inspections are often necessary to gather evidence needed for proving regulatory violations. These inspections can also be used in place of formal hearings.

:p What is the primary purpose of on-site inspections according to the passage?
??x
On-site inspections serve the dual purpose of gathering evidence needed to prove a regulatory violation and sometimes replacing formal hearings by demonstrating the need to correct or prevent undesirable conditions.
x??

---
#### Types of Subpoenas Used by Agencies
Background context: The text describes two types of subpoenas—subpoena ad testificandum and subpoena duces tecum—which are used by agencies to obtain testimony or documents.

:p What are the two basic types of subpoenas mentioned in the passage?
??x
The two basic types of subpoenas are:
1. Subpoena ad testificandum, which compels a witness to appear at an agency hearing.
2. Subpoena duces tecum, which compels an individual or organization to hand over books, papers, records, or documents to the agency.
x??

---
#### Legal Limits on Administrative Subpoenas
Background context: The passage states that courts may consider various factors to determine if an agency is abusing its discretion in pursuing information through administrative subpoenas. These factors include the purpose of the investigation.

:p What factors might a court consider when determining whether an agency's use of an administrative subpoena has abused its discretion?
??x
Courts may consider several factors, including the legitimacy of the investigation’s purpose. For example, an agency cannot issue an administrative subpoena to inspect business records if the motive is to harass or pressure the business into settling an unrelated matter.
x??

#### Background of NCNPR and Government Regulation
Since 1968, the National Center for Natural Products Research (NCNPR) at the University of Mississippi has held a unique registration to grow marijuana for research purposes. This registration is administered by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), which falls under the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and ultimately the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The contract for this purpose undergoes competitive bidding every five years.
:p What does the background context reveal about NCNPR's role in growing marijuana?
??x
The NCNPR at the University of Mississippi has been the sole entity registered by the DEA to manufacture marijuana since 1968. This registration is managed by NIDA, a component of NIH under HHS, through a competitive bidding process every five years.
x??

---

#### Competition Argument and Administrator’s Response
Dr. Craker argues that there cannot be "adequately competitive conditions" due to only one manufacturer of marijuana. However, the Administrator countered this by noting that NIDA has provided marijuana at cost or free to researchers in the past. Dr. Craker could also bid for the contract when it next comes up for renewal.
:p How did the Administrator respond to Dr. Craker’s argument about competition?
??x
The Administrator responded by pointing out that NIDA had historically supplied marijuana either at cost or free of charge, and that Dr. Craker was free to bid on the contract during its renewal process. The term "adequately competitive conditions" under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) is not as restrictive as suggested by Dr. Craker.
x??

---

#### Supply Adequacy and Research Demand
The Administrator found that there were over 1,000 kilograms of marijuana in NIDA's possession, which far exceeds current research demands and any foreseeable future demand. Dr. Craker argued that the adequacy of supply should be measured against FDA-approved projects rather than NIDA-approved ones.
:p What evidence did the Administrator provide regarding the adequacy of the marijuana supply?
??x
The Administrator provided evidence that there were over 1,000 kilograms of marijuana in NIDA's possession, which significantly exceeds both current and foreseeable future research demands. This amount is more than ninety times what Dr. Craker proposed to supply.
x??

---

#### Decision on Petition for Review
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit denied Dr. Craker’s petition to review the agency’s order because the Administrator's interpretation of the CSA was permissible, and her findings were reasonable and supported by evidence.
:p Why did the court deny Dr. Craker’s petition to review?
??x
The court denied Dr. Craker’s petition due to two main reasons: first, the Administrator's interpretation of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) was permissible; second, the findings made by the Administrator were reasonable and well-supported by evidence.
x??

---

#### Procedural Process for Review
The text emphasizes that a court should wait to review an agency’s order until it has gone through the entire procedural process and can be considered final. This ensures that all steps in the administrative process have been properly followed before judicial intervention is sought.
:p Why does the text recommend waiting for the order to become final before reviewing?
??x
The recommendation is made because waiting allows the administrative process to fully unfold, ensuring that all procedural steps are completed and that the decision has reached a state where it can be meaningfully reviewed by a court. This approach upholds the principle of allowing agencies to make decisions within their jurisdiction before judicial intervention.
x??

#### Background of Petitioner's Case
The Vara Declaration describes a case where a petitioner, identified as Vara, was denied training request #565192 to train at FlightSafety International—Paris Learning Center. The declaration provides details about Vara's criminal history and activities related to drug trafficking and firearms smuggling.
:p What is the background of the petitioner's case?
??x
The petitioner, Vara, had a criminal history including conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute controlled substances. He was convicted in 2007 and sentenced to 80 months imprisonment. His conviction made him inadmissible to the United States, leading to the revocation of his FAA Airman's Certificate. Vara was deported to Venezuela in March 2010.
Vara maintained a U.S. address after deportation, which could be problematic given his criminal history. Additionally, there were concerns about his involvement with firearms trafficking and previous incidents involving private aircraft used for illegal activities.
??x
This background sets the stage for understanding why Vara's training request was denied based on national security concerns.

---

#### TSA's Jurisdiction
The text states that actions taken by TSA on behalf of the Secretary of Homeland Security are subject to review. The court acknowledges TSA's broad authority over civil aviation security and emphasizes that it is TSA’s responsibility to balance convenience with safety.
:p What does the document say about TSA's jurisdiction?
??x
According to the text, an action taken by TSA on behalf of the Secretary of Homeland Security is clearly subject to judicial review. This means that when TSA makes a decision regarding training requests or any other security-related actions, it can be challenged in court if the petitioner believes the decision was arbitrary or not in accordance with law.
??x
This jurisdictional statement highlights the legal framework within which TSA operates and how its decisions are scrutinized.

---

#### Standard of Review under Administrative Procedure Act
The document mentions that courts must review TSA's decisions using the standards set by the Administrative Procedure Act. Specifically, a court should uphold TSA’s decisions unless they are found to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or not in accordance with law.
:p What is the standard of review for TSA decisions according to the text?
??x
The standard of review for TSA's decisions under the Administrative Procedure Act requires that courts must uphold these decisions unless they are found to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. This means that the court should defer to TSA actions that reasonably interpret and enforce safety and security obligations.
??x
This standard emphasizes the importance of deferring to TSA's expertise in assessing risks to national security.

---

#### TSA's Decision on Petitioner's Training Request
The document explains that due to Vara’s criminal history, including his conviction for drug trafficking, maintenance of a U.S. address after deportation, and involvement with firearms smuggling, TSA concluded he posed a threat to aviation and national security.
:p Why did TSA deny the petitioner's training request?
??x
TSA denied the petitioner's training request because his criminal history, which included conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute controlled substances, made him inadmissible to the United States. His conviction led to the revocation of his FAA Airman’s Certificate and deportation to Venezuela. Additionally, there were concerns about his suspected involvement in firearms trafficking, which demonstrated a willingness to use aircraft for criminal activities.
??x
This rationale underscores why TSA deemed Vara's request as high risk based on national security concerns.

---

#### Petitioner's Arguments Against Denial
Vara argues that TSA should not have used his suspected firearms trafficking or his Massachusetts address to support its decision. He claims the address actually belongs to his brother, and he has never illegally entered the United States.
:p What arguments did the petitioner make against TSA’s denial?
??x
The petitioner argued that TSA improperly used evidence related to his suspected firearms trafficking and maintained a U.S. address (which he claimed belonged to his brother) to support its decision to deny his training request. He insisted that he had never illegally entered the United States.
??x
These arguments highlight Vara's attempt to challenge the grounds on which his denial was based.

---

#### Court’s Decision-Making Process
The text emphasizes that courts must defer to TSA actions that reasonably interpret and enforce safety and security obligations, as TSA has broad authority over civil aviation security. Courts are not expected to second-guess expert agency judgments on potential risks to national security.
:p How should the court approach TSA's decisions regarding training requests?
??x
Courts should uphold TSA’s decisions unless they are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. The court must defer to TSA actions that reasonably interpret and enforce safety and security obligations because TSA has broad authority over civil aviation security.
??x
This approach ensures that courts give appropriate weight to TSA's expert judgment on national security matters.

---
#### Government Regulation Overview
Background context: The text discusses various aspects of government regulation, including congressional review periods, judicial enforcement, and mechanisms for small business feedback. These regulations aim to balance public interest with economic impacts on businesses.

:p What are some examples of government regulations mentioned in the text?
??x
The text mentions Congress's review period before new federal regulations take effect, the courts enforcing the Regulatory Flexibility Act to protect small businesses, and the Office of the National Ombudsman at the Small Business Administration receiving comments from small businesses.
x??

---
#### SEC as an Executive vs. Independent Agency
Background context: The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is described in detail regarding its role in enforcing insider trading laws. The question examines whether it is an executive agency or an independent regulatory agency, which can affect legal procedures.

:p Is the SEC an executive agency or an independent regulatory agency? Does it matter to the outcome of this dispute?
??x
The SEC is typically considered an independent regulatory agency because its creation and functions are defined by specific legislation. This independence matters as it affects how rules are made and enforced, including whether certain procedural requirements apply.

For example, if the SEC were treated as an executive agency, different procedural standards might be applied under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).

If this is a dispute over enforcement procedures, the nature of the SEC's status could affect the applicability of APA provisions.
x??

---
#### Arbitrariness and Capriciousness
Background context: The question assesses whether a court would find the SEC's new rulemaking action arbitrary or capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).

:p Would a court be likely to find that the SEC’s action was arbitrary and capricious under the APA?
??x
A court is unlikely to find the SEC's action arbitrary and capricious if it can show consistency with past practices. The SEC's argument that it has always had the authority to pursue insider trading regardless of profit would support this claim.

If the new rule does not deviate significantly from past practices, a court might conclude that the change was not arbitrary or capricious.
x??

---
#### Chevron Deference
Background context: The question evaluates whether a court is likely to give Chevron deference to the SEC's interpretation of insider trading laws. Chevron deference applies when an agency’s interpretation of its own statutory authority has been upheld in the past.

:p Would a court be likely to give Chevron deference to the SEC’s interpretation of the law on insider trading?
??x
A court is more likely to give Chevron deference if the SEC has consistently interpreted the law in a certain way over time. If the SEC's new rule follows this consistent interpretation, the court might find it reasonable and uphold it.

If the SEC's interpretation is novel or inconsistent with past practices, the court may be less inclined to grant deference.
x??

---
#### Determining Rule Type
Background context: The question considers whether a new rule is merely interpretive, which would affect procedural requirements under the APA. Interpretive rules do not require formal rulemaking.

:p Now assume that a court finds that the new rule is merely “interpretive.” What effect would this determination have on whether the SEC had to follow the APA’s rulemaking procedures?
??x
If the new rule is deemed interpretive, the SEC would not need to follow the APA's notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures. Interpretive rules are generally considered less formal and do not require public comment or hearings.

However, this determination could still be subject to judicial review for consistency with the agency’s existing policies and statutory authority.
x??

---
#### Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) Fairness
Background context: The question addresses potential biases in administrative proceedings, specifically whether having only one ALJ per hearing might promote fairness. An ALJ acts as both judge and jury.

:p Because an administrative law judge (ALJ) acts as both judge and jury, there should always be at least three ALJs in each administrative hearing. What safeguards promote the ALJ’s fairness?
??x
Having multiple ALJs ensures a more balanced decision-making process by reducing the risk of bias or error. An ALJ acting alone might face pressure from stakeholders, but having multiple judges can mitigate these risks and ensure that decisions are made based on objective criteria.

Using three ALJs as suggested helps promote fairness by providing cross-checks during proceedings.
x??

#### Clean Air Act (CAA) and EPA Authority
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is authorized under the Clean Air Act (CAA) to regulate any air pollutants emitted into the ambient air if they are found to cause or contribute to air pollution. The CAA specifically mentions that the EPA can take action based on their judgment.
:p Did the EPA have the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles according to the CAA?
??x
The EPA had the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act (CAA) because carbon dioxide and other "greenhouse gases" are air pollutants that can contribute to air pollution. However, the refusal was based on the interpretation of recent amendments which did not explicitly authorize new binding auto emission limits.
In the case Commonwealth of Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency (2007), the Supreme Court ruled that the EPA has the authority under Section 202(a) of the CAA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles, provided they contribute to air pollution.
```java
// Pseudocode for understanding the EPA's regulatory process
public class EPARegulation {
    public void regulateEmissions(String pollutant) {
        if (pollutant == "carbon dioxide" || pollutant == "greenhouse gases") {
            // Check if the pollutant contributes to air pollution
            boolean contribution = doesContributeToAirPollution(pollutant);
            if (contribution) {
                // Implement regulatory measures
                implementRegulations();
            } else {
                // No action needed
                noActionNeeded();
            }
        } else {
            // Handle other pollutants
            handleOtherPollutants(pollutant);
        }
    }

    private boolean doesContributeToAirPollution(String pollutant) {
        // Logic to determine if the pollutant contributes to air pollution
        return true; // Placeholder for actual logic
    }

    private void implementRegulations() {
        // Code to implement regulations on greenhouse gas emissions
    }

    private void noActionNeeded() {
        // Log or notify that no action is needed
    }

    private void handleOtherPollutants(String pollutant) {
        // Handle other types of pollutants as per CAA guidelines
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Judicial Deference to Agency Decisions
Judicial deference refers to the principle where courts give substantial weight to administrative agencies' interpretations and decisions, particularly when those decisions are based on expertise in a specific field. The level of deference can vary depending on the nature of the agency's decision.
:p In Conley v. National Mines Corp., should a court have deferred to the administrative law judge’s award of benefits?
??x
In Conley v. National Mines Corp., the court should not have fully deferred to the administrative law judge’s award of benefits, as there was insufficient evidence supporting the conclusion that coal dust was a substantial contributing factor to Conley's death.
The administrative decision relied on an unexplained physician testimony without any substantiation or corroboration. Courts are generally expected to review such decisions for legal and factual errors and cannot defer if the record does not support the agency’s findings.
```java
// Pseudocode for reviewing an administrative decision
public class CourtReview {
    public void reviewDecision(String evidence) {
        if (evidence != null && !evidence.isEmpty()) {
            // Check if there is sufficient evidence
            boolean sufficientEvidence = hasSufficientEvidence(evidence);
            if (!sufficientEvidence) {
                // Review and possibly overturn the decision
                overturnDecision();
            } else {
                // Uphold the decision based on available evidence
                upholdDecision();
            }
        } else {
            // Insufficient evidence, need more data
            requestMoreEvidence();
        }
    }

    private boolean hasSufficientEvidence(String evidence) {
        // Logic to determine if there is sufficient evidence
        return true; // Placeholder for actual logic
    }

    private void overturnDecision() {
        // Code to overturn the decision and deny benefits
    }

    private void upholdDecision() {
        // Code to uphold the decision and grant benefits
    }

    private void requestMoreEvidence() {
        // Log or notify that more evidence is needed
    }
}
```
x??

#### Arbitrary and Capricious Test
The arbitrary and capricious test is a judicial standard used by courts to evaluate whether an agency's decision was made reasonably, logically, and with due consideration of relevant factors. An action will be considered arbitrary or capricious if it lacks explanation, appears irrational, or shows disregard for relevant evidence.
:p In Manin v. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), was the NTSB’s refusal to consider Manin's argument about his lack of knowledge arbitrary or capricious?
??x
In Manin v. National Transportation Safety Board, the NTSB’s refusal to consider Manin's argument that he did not know he had to report convictions for minor misdemeanors was indeed arbitrary and capricious.
The decision to depart from its own established policy (considering an applicant's understanding of what information a question sought) without explanation or justification lacked rationality. This departure appeared to be unjustified and ignored relevant evidence, thus failing the arbitrary and capricious test.
```java
// Pseudocode for evaluating agency actions under arbitrary and capricious test
public class ArbitraryCapriciousTest {
    public void evaluateDecision(Agent agent, Decision decision) {
        if (agent.hasExplainablePolicy()) {
            // Check if there is a policy in place
            boolean hasPolicy = agent.hasPolicy();
            if (!hasPolicy) {
                // Evaluate based on established procedures and rationality
                if (decision.isRational() && !decision.hasExplanation()) {
                    // Decision appears irrational or lacks explanation
                    declareDecisionArbitraryAndCapricious();
                } else {
                    // Decision is considered valid
                    upholdDecision();
                }
            } else {
                // Policy exists, check adherence to it
                if (agent.adheresToPolicy(decision)) {
                    // Decision adheres to policy and is rational
                    upholdDecision();
                } else {
                    // Departure from policy without explanation
                    declareDecisionArbitraryAndCapricious();
                }
            }
        } else {
            // No policy, evaluate based on other criteria
            if (decision.isRational()) {
                // Decision is rational even without a policy
                upholdDecision();
            } else {
                // Decision appears irrational
                declareDecisionArbitraryAndCapricious();
            }
        }
    }

    private void declareDecisionArbitraryAndCapricious() {
        // Log or notify that the decision is arbitrary and capricious
    }

    private void upholdDecision() {
        // Log or notify that the decision stands as valid
    }
}
```

#### Aviation Incident: Missing Gear Pin
The incident involving a missing gear pin on a CRJ-700 plane operated by GoJet Airlines, LLC highlights issues in mechanical maintenance and operational safety. A proper system for ensuring all parts are accounted for is critical to prevent such incidents.
:p In the context of this incident, what were the potential consequences if the gear pin was not removed?
??x
The potential consequences of leaving a gear pin installed on the CRJ-700 landing gear included severe damage to the aircraft, possibly leading to structural failures during flight. The warning light indicating that the landing gear would not retract after takeoff was an immediate alert suggesting the presence of a safety hazard.
Such incidents could result in:
1. **Structural Damage**: The pin could interfere with the retraction mechanism, causing mechanical failure and potential damage to the aircraft's structure.
2. **Operational Risk**: If undetected, this could lead to a dangerous situation where the landing gear might not fully retract, leading to operational issues or even emergency landings.
3. **Safety Hazards for Passengers and Crew**: Improperly maintained equipment can compromise safety standards, posing risks to all on board.

```java
// Pseudocode for handling gear maintenance and safety checks
public class GearMaintenance {
    public void checkGear(String aircraftModel) {
        if (aircraftModel == "CRJ-700") {
            // Ensure proper maintenance procedures are followed
            boolean isProperlyMaintained = maintainLandingGear(aircraftModel);
            if (!isProperlyMaintained) {
                // Log the issue and take corrective action
                logMaintenanceIssue();
                notifyMechanics();
            } else {
                // Gear is properly maintained
                confirmSafety();
            }
        } else {
            // Handle other aircraft models as needed
            handleOtherAircraft(aircraftModel);
        }
    }

    private boolean maintainLandingGear(String model) {
        // Logic to ensure all parts, including gear pins, are checked and accounted for
        return true; // Placeholder for actual logic
    }

    private void logMaintenanceIssue() {
        // Log the issue in the maintenance record
    }

    private void notifyMechanics() {
        // Notify mechanics of the potential problem
    }

    private void confirmSafety() {
        // Confirm that all safety checks have been met
    }

    private void handleOtherAircraft(String model) {
        // Handle other aircraft models as per specific maintenance protocols
    }
}
```
