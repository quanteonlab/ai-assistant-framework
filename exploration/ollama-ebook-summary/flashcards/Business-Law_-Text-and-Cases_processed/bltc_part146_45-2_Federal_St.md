#### Common Law Actions against Environmental Pollution
Background context: The concept of common law actions for environmental pollution traces its origins to centuries-old English laws. These laws held individuals responsible for operations that created nuisances such as dirt, smoke, noxious odors, noise, or toxic substances. Today, these principles are still used to seek damages and injunctions from business polluters.
If relevant, include any formulas or data explaining the legal balance between costs and harm.

:p What are common law actions against environmental pollution?
??x
Common law actions refer to legal remedies for individuals who have suffered harm due to environmental pollution. These actions can be based on nuisance or negligence theories and allow property owners to seek monetary damages or injunctions from business polluters.

#### Nuisance in Common Law
Background context: The common law doctrine of nuisance holds that a person is liable if their use of property unreasonably interferes with another's right to enjoy or use their own property. Courts balance the harm caused by pollution against the costs of stopping it.

:p What is a "private" nuisance under the common law?
??x
A private nuisance refers to a distinct harm suffered by an individual that is separate from the general public's harm. Property owners can sue for this harm, but they must show a specific injury distinct from the public at large. Some states still require this.

#### Public Nuisance in Common Law
Background context: Unlike private nuisances, which affect individuals, public nuisances involve activities that unreasonably interfere with the health, safety, or welfare of the general public. Public authorities can sue to stop these nuisances.

:p Can a state attorney general sue for a "public" nuisance?
??x
Yes, a state attorney general or other public authority can sue to stop a "public" nuisance under common law principles. This type of nuisance involves activities that unreasonably interfere with the health, safety, or welfare of the general public.

#### Negligence and Strict Liability in Pollution Cases
Background context: Businesses polluters may be sued for negligence if they fail to use reasonable care that causes harm, or under strict liability if their actions result in injury regardless of fault. Employees can also sue employers who do not implement proper pollution controls.

:p What is a negligence action in the context of business polluters?
??x
A negligence action against a business polluter is based on an allegation that the business failed to use reasonable care, which foreseeably caused harm. For example, employees could sue their employer if inadequate pollution controls led to respiratory illnesses due to contaminated air.

#### Tension between Profits and Environmental Protection
Background context: The text discusses the ongoing tension between economic growth and environmental protection. Many businesses face high costs in complying with environmental regulations, leading to conflicts between profit motives and environmental concerns.

:p What is the main tension discussed in this passage?
??x
The main tension discussed is between increasing profits and productivity on one hand, and protecting the environment on the other. This conflict exists both within developed countries and in nations like China, which prioritize industrial growth.

#### Example: Hewitt's Factory Nuisance
Background context: The example provided illustrates how a factory might cause harm to neighboring landowners through pollution.

:p How does Hewitt’s factory potentially violate common law?
??x
Hewitt’s factory may violate common law by causing smoke, soot, and vibrations that unreasonably interfere with the rights of neighboring landowners to use or enjoy their property. This could constitute a private nuisance.
x??

#### Subsection (d) Limitation on Permit Duration
Subsection (d) of the regulation limits a permit’s duration to one year. This limitation is meant to ensure that permits remain relevant and up-to-date, as circumstances can change rapidly.

:p How does subsection (d) limit the issuance of depredation permits?
??x
Subsection (d) limits the duration of a depredation permit to one year. This means that the agency must regularly review and potentially renew or update these permits to reflect current conditions and needs.
x??

---

#### Subsection (c) General Conditions for Permits
Section 21.41(c) sets forth common conditions applicable to all permits, such as prohibitions on certain hunting practices and requirements for disposing of killed birds. Additionally, it notes that depredation permits are subject to the general conditions outlined in 50 C.F.R. Part 13.

:p What does subsection (c) require from depredation permit applicants?
??x
Subsection (c) requires depredation permit applicants to comply with prohibitions on certain hunting practices and mandates steps for disposing of birds that have been killed. It also indicates that the general conditions set forth in 50 C.F.R. Part 13 apply to these permits.
x??

---

#### Section 21.41(b) Application Requirements
Section 21.41(b) specifies what information applicants must include in their permit applications, including identifying the particular species of migratory birds committing injury.

:p How does subsection (b) limit FWS's authority?
??x
Subsection (b) actually does not limit FWS’s authority to issue permits; it requires applicants to provide specific details about the species involved. FOA argues that this regulation limits FWS, but the court finds that Section 21.41(b) governs applicants and specifies what information must be included in applications.
x??

---

#### Section 21.41(c)(1) Permittee Restrictions
Section 21.41(c)(1) states that permittees may not kill migratory birds unless specifically authorized on the permit.

:p How does subsection (c)(1) interact with emergency-take provisions?
??x
Subsection (c)(1) restricts what permittees can do by prohibiting them from killing migratory birds unless specifically authorized. However, this does not conflict with emergency-take provisions because such provisions are considered specific authorizations under the permit's conditions.
x??

---

#### Emergency-Take Provisions
Emergency-take provisions allow for the taking of migratory birds in situations posing a direct threat to human safety.

:p Can FWS issue permits that include emergency-take provisions?
??x
Yes, FWS has authority to issue depredation permits that include emergency-take provisions. These provisions are not restricted by Subsections (c)(1) and (d), as the permit specifically authorizes taking migratory birds in certain emergency situations.
x??

---

#### Conclusion of the Case
The court concludes that FWS did not violate Section 21.41 when issuing a depredation permit to the Port Authority.

:p What is the final judgment of the case?
??x
The court affirmed the order, concluding that FWS did not violate Section 21.41 by issuing the depredation permit to the Port Authority.

#### Environmental Impact Statements (EIS)
All agencies of the federal government must consider environmental factors when making significant decisions. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires an EIS for every major federal action that significantly affects the environment. An EIS must analyze:
1. The impact the action will have on the environment.
2. Any adverse effects and alternative actions that might be taken.
3. Any irreversible effects.

An action qualifies as "major" if it involves a substantial commitment of resources (monetary or otherwise). An action is “federal” if a federal agency has the power to control it.
:p What are the key components an Environmental Impact Statement must analyze?
??x
The EIS must analyze:
1. The impact that the proposed action will have on the environment.
2. Any adverse effects and alternative actions that might be taken.
3. Any irreversible effects of the proposed action.

This ensures a comprehensive assessment of environmental impacts before a major federal decision is made, promoting sustainable development.
x??

#### Major Federal Actions
A significant federal action must be substantial in nature to be considered "major." This includes actions involving:
- A substantial commitment of resources (monetary or otherwise).
- Federal agency control over the action.

Examples include the construction of a ski resort on federal land, nuclear plant operations requiring federal permits, and dam creation as part of a federal project.
:p Can you give an example of what qualifies as a "major" federal action?
??x
Construction or operation of a nuclear plant, which requires a federal permit, necessitates an EIS, as does the creation of a dam as part of a federal project.

These actions involve substantial commitments of resources and are controlled by federal agencies.

#### Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Clean Air Act
The Clean Air Act provides regulations to control multistate air pollution. It covers both mobile sources (such as automobiles and other vehicles) and stationary sources (such as electric utilities and industrial plants).

Key sections of the Clean Air Act are 42 U.S.C. Sections 7401 et seq.
:p What does the Clean Air Act cover?
??x
The Clean Air Act covers:
- Mobile sources, such as automobiles and other vehicles.
- Stationary sources, such as electric utilities and industrial plants.

This legislation allows for federal involvement in air pollution control across multiple states.

#### River Personhood - New Zealand Case
In 2017, New Zealand enacted a law that declared the Whanganui River to be a legal person. This means it can own property, incur debts, and petition courts.

The law is based on the Maori belief: "I am the river, and the river is me," acknowledging the deep spiritual connection between humans and the environment.
:p What does the New Zealand law declare about the Whanganui River?
??x
New Zealand's law declares that the Whanganui River is a legal person, meaning it can:
- Own property.
- Incur debts.
- Petition courts.

This recognizes the river as a "living whole" and ends an ownership dispute dating back more than 140 years.
