#### Arbitration Program for Warranties
Background context: When an owner encounters a problem under a manufacturer’s warranty, they must submit their complaint to a specified arbitration program. The decisions of these arbitration panels are binding on manufacturers but not typically on purchasers. Major automobile companies operate their own arbitration panels.
:p What is the role of an arbitration program in warranty disputes?
??x
The arbitration program acts as a mediator where the manufacturer and consumer can present their case, and an impartial panel makes a decision based on the evidence provided. These decisions are binding on manufacturers but not typically on purchasers.

#### Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act
Background context: The Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act aims to prevent deception in warranties by requiring them to be easier to understand for consumers. It applies specifically to consumer transactions, modifying UCC warranty rules accordingly.
:p What is the purpose of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act?
??x
The act's primary goal is to ensure that warranties are clear and understandable for consumers, preventing misleading or confusing terms. By requiring certain disclosures in a single document, it aims to protect consumers' rights and reduce confusion.

#### Types of Warranties (Express vs. Implied)
Background context: There are two main types of warranties—express and implied. Express warranties are explicitly stated by the seller, while implied warranties arise from the nature of the transaction or by law.
:p What distinguishes express warranties from implied warranties?
??x
Express warranties are clearly communicated by the seller, such as in written or verbal agreements. Implied warranties, on the other hand, exist based on the nature of the sale and are not explicitly stated but are still legally binding. For instance, an implied warranty of merchantability ensures that a product is fit for ordinary use.
x??

#### Cumulative Nature of Warranties
Background context: According to UCC rules, express and implied warranties can coexist in a transaction if they are consistent with each other. The court interprets multiple warranties as cumulative unless this interpretation is unreasonable.
:p How do courts interpret the relationship between express and implied warranties?
??x
Courts view express and implied warranties as cumulative if they are consistent. This means that both types of warranties can apply together, enhancing consumer protection. However, if the interpretations conflict, the court may look at party intent to determine which warranty takes precedence.
x??

#### Conflicting Warranties
Background context: When there are conflicting warranties—express and implied—it is important to understand how courts resolve these conflicts. The general rule is that express warranties take precedence over inconsistent implied warranties, except for those related to fitness for a particular purpose.
:p How do courts handle situations where both an express and an implied warranty conflict?
??x
Courts generally prioritize express warranties over inconsistent implied ones, with the exception of implied warranties of fitness for a particular purpose. This means that if a seller provides an express warranty contradicting an implied one, the express warranty typically prevails.

#### As Is Clause in Sales Contracts
Background context: The Kentucky Revised Statute (355.2-316) defines how "as is" clauses operate within sales contracts for goods, particularly focusing on the exclusion of implied warranties and shifting risk to the buyer.

:p What does an "as is" clause in a sales contract mean?
??x
An "as is" clause typically means that the buyer takes all risks regarding the quality and condition of the goods being sold. The seller makes no express or implied warranties about the value or condition of the item.
??x

---

#### Exclusion of Implied Warranties
Background context: Under Kentucky Revised Statute 355.2-316, certain expressions like "as is" and "with all faults" can exclude implied warranties if the circumstances do not indicate otherwise.

:p How does an "as is" clause affect the seller's liability?
??x
An "as is" clause prevents a buyer from holding the seller liable for any defects or issues with the goods, as it means the buyer accepts all risks associated with the quality and condition of the item. The seller provides no assurances, either express or implied.
??x

---

#### Buyer’s Agreement in As Is Clauses
Background context: In sales contracts where an "as is" clause is present, buyers agree to make their own appraisal of the value or condition of the goods, thereby accepting the risk that the item may be worth less than expected.

:p What does a buyer agree to when purchasing something "as is"?
??x
When purchasing something "as is," a buyer agrees to evaluate the value and condition of the item on their own. They accept all risks associated with any defects or lower-than-expected value, without expecting the seller to make any guarantees.
??x

#### Legal Requirements for Fraud Actions
Background context: To prove fraud in court, a party must demonstrate specific elements such as material misrepresentation by the seller, knowledge of its falsity, intent to deceive, reasonable reliance, and resulting injury.

:p What are the six elements required to prove fraud?
??x
To prove fraud, a party must show:
1. A material misrepresentation.
2. The misrepresentation was false.
3. The seller knew it was false.
4. The seller intended for the buyer to rely on the misrepresentation.
5. The buyer reasonably relied on the misrepresentation.
6. The reliance caused injury.
??x

---

#### Effect of As Is Clauses
Background context: "As is" clauses shift risk from the seller to the buyer, preventing buyers from claiming injuries due to decreased value or condition unless there are specific circumstances that indicate otherwise.

:p How do as is clauses affect claims of breach of warranty?
??x
As is clauses generally prevent buyers from holding sellers liable for any issues related to the condition or value of the goods. However, if a claim involves consequential damages (injury to a person or property due to a breach of warranty), it may still be possible to pursue a fraud action.
??x

---

#### Consequential Damages and As Is Clauses
Background context: An "as is" clause does not bar all claims of fraud; specifically, if the injury results from a breach of warranty leading to consequential damages (injury to a person or property), a buyer may still have grounds for an action.

:p Can as is clauses prevent claims of consequential damages?
??x
As is clauses generally do not prevent claims of consequential damages if the injury arises from a breach of warranty. In such cases, the buyer can potentially prove fraud based on the seller's misrepresentation leading to specific injuries beyond just the value or condition of the goods.

#### Issue Spotters: GCC vs. Industrial Supplies, Inc.
Background context explaining the concept of implied warranties and their relevance to this scenario. GCC is suing Industrial for a product that did not meet specific requirements despite no express promises being made.

:p What should GCC argue in its lawsuit against Industrial?
??x
GCC should argue that even though there were no expressly stated warranties, there was an implied warranty of merchantability. This means the adhesive provided by Industrial must be suitable for its ordinary purposes as described. Since it failed to meet GCC's specific requirements and caused a loss, GCC can claim breach of this implied warranty.

#### Issue Spotters: Coffee Incident at Roasted Bean
Explanation about implied warranties of merchantability and their relevance in consumer product disputes.

:p Can Stella recover for third-degree burns from the coffee incident?
??x
Stella might have a case under the implied warranty of merchantability. This warranty implies that the product (the cup) is fit for its ordinary purpose, which includes holding hot liquids without leaking or melting. Since the cup failed to perform this basic function and caused significant harm, Stella could potentially recover damages.

However, it's crucial to consider local laws regarding negligence in such cases as well.

#### Business Scenario: Moon vs. Davidson Hardware
Explanation on implied warranties of fitness for a particular purpose and their application in agricultural contexts.

:p How successful will Moon be in his suit against Davidson?
??x
Moon is likely to have a strong case based on the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. This warranty implies that the product (the rope) must meet the specific needs stated by the buyer, especially when such needs are communicated clearly. Given that the rope failed and caused severe damage to the equipment, Moon can argue a breach of this warranty.

The success would depend on proving that:
1. Davidson recommended the rope for farm use.
2. The rope was expected to withstand the task (lifting 2000 lbs).
3. The rope broke unexpectedly under normal conditions.

#### Business Scenario: Warranty Disclaimer and Disclaimers
Explanation about warranty disclaimers in contracts, their enforceability, and limitations.

:p Can Tandy recover the purchase price despite the disclaimer?
??x
Tandy likely cannot recover the purchase price due to the explicit disclaimer of all warranties, including merchantability. Under contract law, such disclaimers are generally valid if they meet certain criteria (e.g., clear and conspicuous language). Since the disclaimer was printed in standard size and color, it probably meets these requirements.

The key is whether the disclaimer adequately draws Tandy's attention to the limitations on warranty coverage.

#### Business Scenario: Express Warranties
Explanation of express warranties and their application in consumer product disputes involving quality claims.

:p What are the allegations in Charmaine Schreib’s case against Disney?
??x
Charmaine Schreib and others who bought the tapes allege breach of an express warranty. The advertising statements about the "Gold Collection" or "Masterpiece Collection" created a promise that these tapes would be high-quality, durable products.

The key issue will likely focus on whether:
1. The advertisements made specific promises about the quality and durability of the tapes.
2. These promises created legally binding warranties.
3. The sticky shed syndrome constitutes a failure to meet those implied expectations.

#### Implied Warranties - Bariven, S.A. Case

Background context: In this case, Bariven, S.A., entered into a contract with Absolute Trading Corp. to purchase 26,000 metric tons of powdered milk worth $123.5 million. The first shipments were received without issues, but after China resumed dairy exports, sixteen more shipments arrived which later tested positive for dangerous levels of melamine.

Relevant concept: Implied warranties are promises that arise from the nature of the transaction, such as fitness for a particular purpose or merchantability.

:p Did Absolute Trading Corp. breach any implied warranties in this case?
??x
Yes, Absolute Trading Corp. breached an implied warranty of merchantability and possibly an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. The implied warranty of merchantability ensures that goods are fit for ordinary purposes for which such goods are used. In this context, the milk should not have contained dangerous levels of melamine, as it was harmful to health. Additionally, given that Bariven had purchased the milk specifically for use in Venezuela (a particular purpose), there could also be an implied warranty of fitness for that specific use.

The tests revealed that the milk contained high levels of melamine, which is not fit for consumption and thus breached these implied warranties.

#### Express Warranties - Gobran Auto Sales Inc. Case

Background context: Charity Bell purchased a used Toyota Avalon from Awny Gobran of Gobran Auto Sales, Inc., with the odometer reading 147,000 miles. The car was promoted as being in good condition. However, Bell later discovered that the car had been involved in an accident and its last reported odometer reading was significantly higher.

Relevant concept: Express warranties are promises made by a seller to a buyer about the quality or characteristics of goods sold.

:p Was the "as is" disclaimer sufficient for Gobran Auto Sales Inc. to avoid any liability?
??x
No, the "as is" disclaimer in this case is not sufficient to completely protect Gobran Auto Sales Inc. from liability. Even with a warranty disclaimer, Gobran should have disclosed that there was an accident and that the odometer reading might be inaccurate. Bell's lack of obtaining the Carfax report until after purchasing the car does not excuse Gobran's obligation to disclose all known defects.

If Gobran had provided this information upfront, it could potentially avoid liability.

#### Implied Warranties - Clear Boggy Case

Background context: Harold Moore purchased a barrel-racing horse named Clear Boggy for $100,000. The seller, Betty Roper, was an appraiser of barrel-racing horses and promoted the horse as competitive. Upon purchasing, Clear Boggy exhibited significant performance issues and medical problems that were not disclosed by Roper.

Relevant concept: Implied warranties include fitness for a particular purpose and merchantability. Fitness for a particular purpose means the goods are suitable for the buyer's specific intended use, while merchantability means they must be fit for ordinary purposes of such goods.

:p Can Harold Moore prevail in a lawsuit against Betty Roper for breach of the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose?
??x
Yes, Harold Moore can potentially prevail in a lawsuit against Betty Roper for breaching the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. Clear Boggy was specifically purchased by Moore’s daughter for barrel-racing, which is a competitive sport. The horse should have been fit to compete at a high level without significant performance issues or medical problems.

Roper's representation that Clear Boggy did not have any performance issues or medical problems and the subsequent discovery of serious issues (arthritis, impinged vertebrae, foot problems, fracture) indicate a breach of this implied warranty. Thus, Moore has a strong case for breach of contract.

#### Sources of International Law
Background context: The text introduces that international law has three primary sources: international customs, treaties and international agreements, and international organizations. These sources help govern relations among or between nations.

:p What are the three main sources of international law?
??x
The three main sources of international law are international customs, treaties and international agreements, and international organizations.
x??

---

#### International Customs as a Source of Law
Background context: Article 38(1) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice defines an international custom as "evidence of a general practice accepted as law." This indicates that customary practices among nations can become part of their legal framework.

:p How is an international custom defined in international law?
??x
An international custom in international law is defined as evidence of a general practice accepted as law. Article 38(1) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice refers to this definition.
x??

---

#### Enforcement of International Law
Background context: Unlike national laws, which can be enforced by government authorities, there is no higher authority that enforces international law among sovereign nations. Violations may lead to coercive actions such as economic sanctions or war.

:p How do countries enforce international law?
??x
Countries do not have a central authority to enforce international law. In cases of violations, other countries or international organizations typically respond with coercive measures like economic sanctions, severance of diplomatic relations, boycotts, and in extreme cases, war.
x??

#### Example 24.1 - Russia's Actions Against Ukraine
Background context: The text provides an example where Russia violated Ukraine’s sovereignty by sending troops into Crimea, supporting secession from Ukraine, leading to international condemnation through economic sanctions.

:p What actions did Russia take that violated Ukraine’s sovereignty according to the example?
??x
Russia sent troops into Ukraine and supported an election allowing Crimea to secede, thereby violating Ukraine's independent sovereignty.

#### Commerce in a Globalized World
Background context: The text mentions how technological advancements have led to significant growth in global trade and the emergence of a global business community. This has necessitated laws governing international business transactions.

:p What factors have contributed to the globalization of commerce?
??x
Technological advancements have fueled dramatic growth in world trade, leading to the emergence of a global business community. Global exchanges of goods, services, and intellectual property are now routine.
x??

#### International Law vs. National Law
Background context: The text differentiates between international law and national law, emphasizing that while government authorities can enforce national laws, there is no such central authority for international laws.

:p What is the key difference between international law and national law?
??x
The key difference between international law and national law is that government authorities can enforce national law but there is no higher authority to enforce international law among sovereign nations.
x??

:p What types of laws affect the international legal environment of business?
??x
Laws affecting the international legal environment of business include both international law (formed through customs, treaties, and organizations) and national law.
x??

---

#### Creation of International Law Through Agreements
Background context: The text explains that international law can be created when individual nations agree to comply with certain standards or when industries establish international standards for private transactions.

:p How is international law created according to the example?
??x
International law can be created through agreements where individual nations sign treaties agreeing to certain standards, or by industries establishing international standards for cross-border transactions.
