**Starting Chapter:** 35-2 Discrimination Based on Age

---

#### Same-Gender Harassment
Background context: In Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., the United States Supreme Court held that Title VII protection extends to individuals who are sexually harassed by members of the same gender. Proving that the harassment is "based on sex" can be difficult, but it's easier when the harasser is homosexual.

:p What does Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., establish regarding sexual harassment?
??x
The Supreme Court ruled that Title VII protects individuals from being sexually harassed by members of the same gender. This means that even if a coworker of the same gender engages in unwanted sexual behavior or comments, the victim can seek protection under Title VII.
x??

---
#### Sexual-Orientation Harassment
Background context: Although Title VII does not explicitly prohibit discrimination or harassment based on sexual orientation, at least one federal court has ruled that it is protected. Additionally, many states and organizations have enacted policies to protect against such discrimination.

:p Can Title VII be used to protect individuals from sexual-orientation-based harassment?
??x
Yes, although Title VII does not explicitly mention sexual orientation, there are cases where courts have ruled that it can provide protection. Furthermore, some states and organizations have established specific policies to prevent sexual orientation discrimination.
x??

#### Online Harassment
Background context: Employees' online activities can lead to claims of hostile environment harassment or other forms of discrimination. Actions like racial jokes, ethnic slurs, or viewing sexually explicit images on a co-worker's computer screen could be considered offensive and potentially create a hostile work environment.

:p Can employers avoid liability for online harassment by taking remedial action?
??x
Yes, if an employer takes prompt and appropriate steps to address the harassment, they may be able to avoid legal liability. The key is to have a clear policy in place and enforce it rigorously.

#### Remedies under Title VII
Background context: If a plaintiff proves unlawful discrimination under Title VII, remedies can include reinstatement, back pay, retroactive promotions, and damages. However, there are limits on the amount of damages that can be awarded.

:p What kind of damages can an employee recover in a successful Title VII claim?
??x
Employees can recover several types of damages if they successfully prove unlawful discrimination, including:
- Reinstatement: Returning to the job.
- Back pay: Compensation for lost wages due to discriminatory practices.
- Retroactive promotions: Being promoted retroactively.
- Damages: Both compensatory (to compensate for actual harm) and punitive (as punishment for severe misconduct).

Compensatory damages are only available in cases of intentional discrimination, while punitive damages against private employers require proof of malice or reckless indifference. The total amount depends on the size of the employer; for example, there is a $50,000 cap on damages from employers with one hundred or fewer employees.

#### Discrimination Based on Age
Background context: Age discrimination can affect anyone at any point in their life and is prohibited by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) which protects individuals 40 years of age or older. The ADEA also prohibits mandatory retirement for non-managerial workers.

:p What does the Age Discrimination in Employment Act protect against?
??x
The Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) protects individuals who are 40 years of age or older from employment discrimination based on their age. It also prevents mandatory retirement except in certain circumstances, such as for non-managerial employees with a bona fide pension plan.

#### Employment Discrimination Immunity for State Employers

Background context: The text discusses how state employers are generally immune from private lawsuits brought by employees under specific federal acts, such as the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and Fair Labor Standards Act.

:p What is the immunity status of state employers regarding private suits under the ADEA?
??x
State employers are usually immune from private suits brought by employees under the ADEA. This immunity stems from the Eleventh Amendment, which generally bars suits against states in federal courts.
x??

---

#### Discrimination Based on Disability and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)

Background context: The ADA prohibits disability-based discrimination in all workplaces with fifteen or more workers, except for state government employers who are immune under the Eleventh Amendment. It requires employers to "reasonably accommodate" the needs of persons with disabilities unless it would cause an "undue hardship."

:p What is required by the ADA for accommodations regarding employees with disabilities?
??x
Under the ADA, employers must reasonably accommodate the needs of persons with disabilities unless such accommodation would cause the employer to suffer an undue hardship. This means making adjustments or modifications that enable individuals with disabilities to enjoy equal employment opportunities.
x??

---

#### Procedures under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)

Background context: To prevail on a claim under the ADA, a plaintiff must show three elements: having a disability, being otherwise qualified for employment, and being excluded from employment solely because of the disability. The EEOC can investigate and sue employers on behalf of employees.

:p What are the three elements required to prevail in an ADA lawsuit?
??x
The three elements required to prevail in an ADA lawsuit are:
1. Having a disability.
2. Being otherwise qualified for the employment in question.
3. Being excluded from the employment solely because of the disability.
x??

---

#### Procedures under the ADA (Continued)

Background context: The EEOC must be pursued before filing a court action, and it can bring suits even if an employee has signed an agreement to arbitrate job-related disputes.

:p What does the plaintiff need to do before pursuing an ADA lawsuit in court?
??x
Before filing an action in court for a violation of the ADA, the plaintiff must pursue the claim through the EEOC. This means the plaintiff should first file a charge with the EEOC and allow it to investigate and potentially sue the employer on behalf of the employee.
x??

#### What Is a Disability? (ADA)

Background context: The ADA defines disability broadly to include physical or mental impairments that substantially limit one or more major life activities, as well as having a record of such an impairment or being regarded as having such an impairment.

:p How is a disability defined under the ADA?
??x
A disability under the ADA includes any of the following:
1. A physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of the affected individual.
2. A record of having such an impairment.
3. Being regarded as having such an impairment.
x??

---

#### Association with Disabled Persons

Background context: The ADA includes a provision preventing employers from taking adverse employment actions based on stereotypes or assumptions about individuals who associate with people who have disabilities.

:p What does the ADA protect against in terms of association?
??x
The ADA protects against employers taking adverse employment actions based on stereotypes or assumptions about individuals who associate with people who have disabilities. This means that an employer cannot discriminate against someone because they are associated with disabled persons, even if there is no actual disability.
x??

---

#### ADA and Disability Discrimination
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibits employment discrimination based on disability. Key points include that employers cannot cap health-care payments for disabled employees differently than other employees. Additionally, the act protects individuals with disabilities such as drug addiction (former addicts only), alcoholism, and mental health conditions.
:p What does the ADA primarily protect against in terms of employment?
??x
The ADA primarily protects against disability-based discrimination in employment by ensuring that employers provide equal opportunities for individuals with disabilities, including those with substance abuse disorders who have completed or are in a supervised rehabilitation program. It also includes protections for alcoholics and mental health conditions.

#### USERRA and Military Service Rights
The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) protects members of the military from discrimination based on their service status. This act applies to all employers, regardless of size or type, and even extends to U.S.-based companies operating in foreign countries.
:p What does USERRA protect against?
??x
USERRA protects members of the military from employment discrimination due to their service status. It ensures that military personnel can return to their jobs after serving without facing discriminatory practices from employers. This protection applies to all types and sizes of employers, including those operating internationally.
x??

---

#### Prima Facie Case under USERRA
To establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the USERRA, an employee must show that the employer took an adverse employment action based partly on their connection with military service. This can include membership, service, application for service, or providing testimony about another's military service.
:p How does one establish a prima facie case of discrimination under USERRA?
??x
To establish a prima facie case of discrimination under USERRA, the employee must demonstrate that:
1. The employer took an adverse employment action.
2. This action was based in part on the employee's connection to military service (e.g., membership, service, application for service, or providing testimony about another's service).
3. A similarly situated non-military individual was treated more favorably.
x??

---

#### Terminations and USERRA
Under the USERRA, veterans can only be terminated from their employment "for cause." The employer is obligated to provide a list of all behaviors that would constitute a valid reason for termination ("cause"). This ensures fair treatment for military personnel who have returned to civilian life.
:p What restrictions does USERRA place on terminations?
??x
USERRA restricts terminations by requiring that veterans can only be terminated "for cause." The employer must provide a clear list of behaviors or actions that would constitute valid reasons for termination. This ensures that military personnel who have returned to civilian life are treated fairly and have the necessary documentation to understand under what circumstances they might lose their job.
x??

---

#### ADA and Substance Abuse
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) considers drug addiction a disability, but only protects former addicts or those in supervised rehabilitation programs. Casual past use of drugs does not qualify as a disability for ADA purposes.
:p What protections does the ADA offer regarding substance abuse?
??x
The ADA offers protections to individuals who have completed or are participating in supervised drug-rehabilitation programs (considered as having a disability). It does not protect casual users of illegal drugs. The ADA focuses on those with a history of addiction and undergoing treatment, ensuring they receive equal employment opportunities.
x??

---

#### ADA and Alcoholism
Alcoholism is considered a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), meaning employers cannot legally discriminate against employees suffering from alcoholism. However, employers can prohibit workplace alcohol use and fire or refuse to hire someone who poses a risk if no reasonable accommodation can reduce that risk.
:p How does the ADA address employment discrimination related to alcoholism?
??x
The ADA addresses employment discrimination by prohibiting employers from discriminating against individuals with alcoholism (considered a disability). Employers may still prohibit alcohol use in the workplace and require sobriety while working. They can terminate or not hire someone who poses an unmanageable risk if there is no reasonable accommodation to mitigate this risk.

#### Seniority Systems
Background context explaining seniority systems and their relevance to employment discrimination cases. In a seniority system, workers are promoted or laid off based on their length of service. This can be a defense against claims of employment discrimination if the system is fair and consistent.

:p What is a seniority system in an employment setting?
??x
A seniority system in an employment setting is a method where employees' promotions, layoffs, and other job benefits are distributed according to the duration of their service with the company. If an employer has a history of discrimination but implements a fair seniority system, it can be used as a defense against claims of employment discrimination.

For example, if an African American woman like Cathalene Johnson alleges pay disparity or discrimination at FedEx, the company might argue that promotions and salary increases are based on a fair seniority system. In the case mentioned, the court ruled that FedEx's seniority system was fair and thus provided a defense to Johnson’s claims.

```java
public class SenioritySystem {
    private List<Employee> employees;

    public void promoteBasedOnSeniority() {
        // Logic for promoting employees based on their years of service
        employees.sort(new Comparator<Employee>() {
            @Override
            public int compare(Employee e1, Employee e2) {
                return Integer.compare(e2.getYearsOfService(), e1.getYearsOfService());
            }
        });
    }

    class Employee {
        private String name;
        private int yearsOfService;

        // Constructor and other methods

        public int getYearsOfService() {
            return yearsOfService;
        }
    }
}
```

#### After-Acquired Evidence of Employee Misconduct
Background context explaining the concept of "after-acquired evidence" and its role in defending against employment discrimination claims. This refers to discovering information about an employee's misconduct after a lawsuit has been filed.

:p What is after-acquired evidence, and how can it be used by employers?
??x
After-acquired evidence is information that an employer discovers after a lawsuit has been filed regarding an employee’s misconduct or misrepresentation in the application process. Employers can use this evidence to argue that they should not be held fully liable for employment discrimination because other reasons existed for terminating the employee.

For example, if Lucy sued Pratt Legal Services for employment discrimination and it was discovered during pre-trial investigation that she made material misrepresentations on her job application, this could limit the damages the employer might owe. However, it does not entirely shield them from liability.

```java
public class AfterAcquiredEvidence {
    private Employee employee;
    private boolean hasMisrepresented;

    public void checkForMisrepresentation() {
        // Check if the employee misrepresented information during application
        if (hasMisrepresented) {
            System.out.println("After-acquired evidence of misrepresentation found.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("No after-acquired evidence of misconduct or misrepresentation.");
        }
    }

    class Employee {
        private boolean misrepresented;

        public boolean getMisrepresented() {
            return misrepresented;
        }
    }
}
```

#### Affirmative Action
Background context explaining affirmative action and its purpose. Affirmative action programs aim to address past discrimination by providing preferential treatment in hiring or promotion for members of protected classes.

:p What is affirmative action, and how does it differ from general equal opportunity policies?
??x
Affirmative action refers to initiatives that seek to correct historical imbalances and promote diversity by giving members of certain protected classes (such as women and minority groups) preferential treatment in employment decisions. Unlike equal opportunity policies which focus on prohibiting discrimination without providing specific advantages, affirmative action programs actively work to increase the representation of these groups.

The Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not mandate or prohibit affirmative action but leaves it up to private companies to decide whether to implement such programs voluntarily. While this approach aims to rectify past wrongs, it can be controversial due to concerns about reverse discrimination against members of majority groups like white males.

```java
public class AffirmativeAction {
    private Map<String, String> protectedClasses;

    public void implementAffirmativeAction() {
        // Implementing affirmative action policies by giving preferential treatment to certain groups
        if (protectedClasses.containsKey("African American")) {
            System.out.println("Affirmative action for African Americans implemented.");
        }
    }

    class ProtectedClass {
        private String name;
        private boolean isProtected;

        public ProtectedClass(String name, boolean isProtected) {
            this.name = name;
            this.isProtected = isProtected;
        }

        public String getName() {
            return name;
        }

        public boolean isProtected() {
            return isProtected;
        }
    }
}
```

#### Equal Protection Issues
Background context explaining the relationship between affirmative action programs and the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution. The equal protection clause prohibits discrimination by state actors, but affirmative action can be seen as inherently discriminatory.

:p How might affirmative action programs violate the equal protection clause, and what are some potential consequences?
??x
Affirmative action programs can potentially violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution because they discriminate in favor of certain groups (protected classes) based on past discrimination. This can lead to reverse discrimination against members of majority groups.

For instance, if an affirmative action policy results in preferential hiring or promotion of African Americans over equally qualified white males, it could be seen as violating their right to equal protection under the law. Such policies have been controversial and often subject to legal challenges and debates about fairness and justice.

```java
public class EqualProtectionIssues {
    private Map<String, String> protectedClasses;

    public void checkForEqualProtectionViolations() {
        // Logic for checking if affirmative action violates equal protection
        if (protectedClasses.containsKey("African American")) {
            System.out.println("Potential violation of equal protection identified.");
        }
    }

    class ProtectedClass {
        private String name;
        private boolean isProtected;

        public ProtectedClass(String name, boolean isProtected) {
            this.name = name;
            this.isProtected = isProtected;
        }

        public String getName() {
            return name;
        }

        public boolean isProtected() {
            return isProtected;
        }
    }
}
```
