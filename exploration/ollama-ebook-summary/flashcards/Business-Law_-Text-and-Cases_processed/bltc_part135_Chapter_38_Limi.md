#### Issue Spotter 1: Darnell and Eliana's Partnership
Darnell and Eliana are partners in an architectural firm, D&E Designs. When Darnell dies, his widow claims that as his heir, she is entitled to take his place as a partner or to receive a share of the firm’s assets.

:p Can Darnell's widow claim her right as a partner?
??x
Darnell's widow cannot automatically become a partner in the firm. Partnership agreements typically specify how the partnership will be handled upon the death of one of its partners. Without specific provisions, the partnership agreement or state laws may determine what happens.

For instance, if D&E Designs is structured as a general partnership (GP), the surviving partner can continue the business without the deceased's heir joining automatically. The agreement might provide for payment to the heir instead of an equal partnership role.

In contrast, if D&E Designs is a limited partnership (LP) or has specific provisions in place, these would dictate whether the widow can join as a new partner or if her inheritance rights lie elsewhere, such as receiving a share of the assets.

If there's no explicit agreement:
1. **GP**: The surviving partner typically continues the business.
2. **LP**: State laws and partnership agreements usually govern heirs' rights.

The specific outcome depends on D&E Designs’ partnership agreement or applicable state law.

#### Issue Spotter 2: Finian and Gloria's Partnership
Finian and Gloria are partners in F&G Delivery Service. Finian, without Gloria’s knowledge, leases the delivery vehicles as moving vans to generate income.

:p Can Finian keep the income from leasing the delivery vehicles without Gloria's consent?
??x
No, Finian cannot keep the income from leasing the delivery vehicles without Gloria's consent. In a partnership, all decisions and actions must be made with mutual agreement unless the partnership agreement allows for certain exceptions (such as an emergency situation).

If there is no explicit provision allowing one partner to make such decisions alone, any income generated should be shared according to the terms of the partnership agreement.

For example:
- **Profit Sharing**: If Finian and Gloria agreed that profits would only come from delivery services, leasing the vehicles for moving vans without their mutual consent could breach this agreement.
- **Decision-Making Authority**: The partnership agreement may specify that major decisions require unanimous consent. Without such an agreement or explicit permission, Finian’s actions are problematic.

If there is no clear agreement:
1. Check the partnership agreement for specific clauses on decision-making and profit-sharing.
2. Follow applicable state laws governing partnerships if no agreement exists.

The income generated from leasing vehicles without Gloria's consent should be returned to her under most circumstances unless a different arrangement was agreed upon in writing.

#### Business Scenario 37-1: Partnership Formation
Daniel owns a chain of shoe stores and hires Rubya as the manager for a new store in Grand Rapids, Michigan. By written contract, Daniel agrees to pay Rubya a monthly salary and 20 percent of the profits. Rubya represents himself as Daniel’s partner to Classen and shows him the agreement.

:p Can Classen hold Daniel liable as a partner if Rubya defaults?
??x
Classen can potentially hold Daniel liable as a partner if there is evidence that Daniel's agreement with Rubya constituted an express or implied partnership. For example, if Daniel's actions or agreements gave Rubya apparent authority to represent the business and negotiate with Classen, this could create a partnership.

Key points:
1. **Express Agreement**: The written contract between Daniel and Rubya could establish a formal partnership.
2. **Implied Partnership**: Actions like paying Rubya a share of profits can imply a partnership if it was known by third parties (like Classen).

To determine liability, consider the following factors:
- **Apparent Authority**: Did Daniel’s actions make it appear that Rubya had authority to act as a partner?
- **Third-Party Perception**: How would a reasonable person view the relationship between Daniel and Rubya?

If the court finds that Daniel's actions created an apparent partnership, he could be held liable for Rubya’s obligations.

#### Business Scenario 37-2: Dissolution of Limited Partnership
Dorinda, Luis, and Elizabeth form a limited partnership where Dorinda is a general partner, and Luis and Elizabeth are limited partners. Consider the events below:
1. Luis assigns his partnership interest to Ashley.
2. Elizabeth is petitioned into involuntary bankruptcy.
3. Dorinda dies.

:p Do these events constitute a dissolution of the limited partnership?
??x
These events do not necessarily constitute a dissolution of the limited partnership:

1. **Luis Assigns Partnership Interest**: An assignment by a limited partner (Luis) does not dissolve the partnership; it only transfers his interest to Ashley, who can become another limited partner.
2. **Elizabeth's Bankruptcy**: A limited partner’s bankruptcy alone does not dissolve the partnership unless the bankruptcy court orders otherwise or there is an agreement that such events lead to dissolution.
3. **Dorinda Dies**: The death of a general partner in a limited partnership typically does not dissolve the partnership, as long as at least one general partner remains.

For dissolution:
- **General Partner's Death**: If all general partners die and no new ones are appointed, it may lead to automatic or mandatory dissolution depending on state law.
- **Bankruptcy**: Bankruptcy of a limited partner generally doesn’t affect the partnership unless specifically stipulated in the partnership agreement or court orders otherwise.

The specific outcome depends on:
1. Partnership Agreement: Check for clauses regarding death, bankruptcy, and general partners' roles.
2. State Law: Follow relevant state laws governing partnerships.

If there is no agreement:
- **General Partner's Death**: Check state law to determine if dissolution is mandatory.
- **Limited Partner’s Bankruptcy**: Consider whether the partnership can continue with the remaining partners or if dissolution is required.

#### Business Scenario 37-3: Partnership Formation
Patricia Garcia and Bernardo Lucero were in a romantic relationship. They acquired an electronics service center, paying $30,000 each. Two years later, they purchased an apartment complex where the property was deeded to Lucero with no down payment from either.

:p Did Patricia and Bernardo have a partnership?
??x
Patricia and Bernardo likely had a partnership based on their actions:
- **Equal Investment**: They invested $30,000 each in the electronics service center.
- **Shared Profits/Losses/Management Rights**: They agreed to share profits, losses, and management rights.

Given these facts, it is reasonable to conclude that they intended to form a partnership. The absence of a written agreement does not negate their intention unless explicitly proven otherwise by state law or court judgment.

The court in Garcia v. Lucero found that the couple had a partnership based on:
1. **Shared Investment**: Equal contributions.
2. **Management and Profit Sharing**: Shared control over the business and profits.

Without a written agreement, courts often look at the conduct of the parties to determine if a partnership exists. If there is no explicit evidence or testimony contradicting their shared intentions, they can be treated as partners in court.

#### Business Scenario 37-4: Winding Up
The Coles operated a Curves franchise exercise facility as a partnership. The firm leased commercial space for a renewable three-year term and renewed it for another three years. Two years into the renewal, the Coles divorced.

:p What happens with the lease obligation after the divorce?
??x
After the divorce, the lease obligation remains binding on the partnership. The lease was signed by Dan and Lori Cole as partners of the Curves franchise exercise facility. However, since they are now separated and one or both may no longer be actively involved in running the business:

1. **Remaining Partner's Obligation**: If only one partner remains involved, that partner must continue fulfilling the lease obligations.
2. **Lease Termination Clause**: Check if the partnership agreement includes a clause allowing for termination or transfer of responsibilities upon divorce.

For example:
- If the partnership agreement allows Lori to take over sole responsibility post-divorce, she would be obligated to fulfill the remaining lease terms.
- If there's no such clause, Dan may still be bound by the original contract unless he is released from his obligations through a legal process.

To avoid default:
1. **Amend Partnership Agreement**: Update the agreement to reflect the change in partners and responsibilities.
2. **Assign Leases**: Transfer the lease obligation to Lori or another party as per partnership agreements or court orders.

If there's no explicit provision, state laws governing business leases may apply, potentially affecting the remaining partner’s liability.

#### Sufficiency of Notice for Tax Sale
Background context: In the case *FS Partners v. York County Tax Claim Bureau*, 132 A.3d 577 (Pa. 2016), FS Partners, a general partnership formed to buy and develop land in York County, Pennsylvania, failed to pay its taxes. The York County Tax Claim Bureau published notice that the property would be sold at a tax sale, mailed a notice to FS’s address of record, and posted a notice on the land.

The question is whether these actions by the bureau provided sufficient notice for the tax sale.
:p Was the notice given by the York County Tax Claim Bureau sufficient for the tax sale?
??x
In Pennsylvania, the notice requirements for a tax sale must be sufficient to inform the general partners of the impending sale. The notice should be reasonably calculated to reach all partners who might be affected.

The notice in this case was adequate because:
1. It was published in the *Pennsylvania Bulletin*, which is required by law.
2. A notice was mailed to FS’s address of record, ensuring that one partner (Stahlman) would receive it.
3. The notice was posted on the property itself.

These steps likely satisfied the notice requirements under Pennsylvania law since all partners who could be affected by the tax sale were given a fair opportunity to respond or contest the sale.

```java
// Pseudocode for notifying partners of a potential tax sale
public class TaxSaleNotification {
    public void sendNotice(Partnership partnership) {
        // Send notice to address of record
        sendMailTo(partnership.getRecordedAddress());
        
        // Post notice on property
        postNoticeOnProperty(partnership.getPropertyAddress());
        
        // Publish in Pennsylvania Bulletin
        publishInBulletin();
    }
}
```

#### Dissociation and Termination of Partnership
Background context: In the case *Congel v. Malfitano*, 31 N.Y.3d 272, 76 N.Y.S.3d 873, 101 N.E.3d 341 (2018), Marc Malfitano and seven others formed Poughkeepsie Galleria as a partnership to own and manage a shopping mall in New York. The partnership agreement required at least fifty-one percent of the partners' votes for any matter, including dissolution.

The question is whether Malfitano had the right to dissociate from the firm unilaterally.
:p Did Malfitano have the power and the right to dissociate from Poughkeepsie Galleria unilaterally?
??x
No, Malfitano did not have the power or the right to unilaterally dissolve the partnership. The partnership agreement required that any decision regarding dissolution must be made by casting votes with no less than fifty-one percent of the partners' approval.

Malfitano's unilateral action was insufficient because:
1. Dissolution requires a vote according to the terms of the partnership agreement.
2. Only a majority vote could legally dissolve the partnership.
3. Malfitano’s action did not comply with the necessary legal procedures set forth in the agreement.

The other partners can continue the business as the partnership agreement was not violated by their continued operation, assuming they maintain the required fifty-one percent or more of votes to make decisions.

```java
// Pseudocode for checking if a partner can unilaterally dissolve a partnership
public boolean canDissolvePartnership(Partnership partnership, Partner dissociatingPartner) {
    // Check if the number of partners voting in favor is at least 51%
    int voteCount = countVotes(partnership);
    int requiredMajority = (int) Math.ceil(voteCount * 0.51);
    
    return dissociatingPartner.getVoteCount() >= requiredMajority;
}
```

#### Ethical Billing Practices and Fiduciary Duty
Background context: In the case *Finch v. Campbell*, 541 S.W.3d 616 (Mo.App.W.D. 2017), Floyd Finch and Bruce Campbell were partners in a law firm, billing their clients on a cash basis. Finch used an outdated software to bill clients months or years after work had been performed, leading to uncollectable accounts receivable.

The question is whether Finch's billing practices violated his fiduciary duty.
:p Was Finch’s billing practice a breach of ethics?
??x
Finch’s billing practice was indeed a breach of ethics. According to the IDDR approach (Intent, Duty, Disclosure, and Reasonableness):

- **Intent**: Finch’s intent appears to be strategic or self-serving by manipulating billing records for personal gain.
- **Duty**: As a partner, Finch had a duty to manage the firm's affairs in good faith and not misappropriate firm resources.
- **Disclosure**: Finch failed to disclose his methods of tracking client work, which is essential for transparency and trust among partners.
- **Reasonableness**: The billing practices were unreasonable as they led to significant uncollectable accounts receivable, harming the firm’s financial health.

Finch's actions violated the fiduciary duty by:
1. Misusing resources (client time records) for personal gain.
2. Failing to provide accurate and timely billing information.
3. Creating an environment of mistrust among partners.

```java
// Pseudocode for checking compliance with ethical billing practices
public boolean isBillingCompliant(BillingRecord record, Partner partner) {
    // Check if the billing record was created within a reasonable time frame
    long currentTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
    long creationTime = record.getCreationTimestamp();
    
    return (currentTime - creationTime <= 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000); // Allow up to 30 days
}
```

#### Definition of LLC
Background context: A limited liability company (LLC) is a hybrid business structure that combines aspects of corporations and partnerships. It offers the benefit of limited personal liability for its members, similar to shareholders in a corporation, while also providing certain tax advantages like pass-through taxation, which avoids double taxation.
:p What defines an LLC?
??x
An LLC is a business entity that blends corporate characteristics such as limited liability for its members with partnership-like benefits including pass-through taxation. Members are shielded from personal liability unless they have significantly contributed to the company's tortious conduct.
??x

---

#### Formation and Operation of LLCs
Background context: LLCs must be formed and operated in compliance with state laws, which can vary widely across states. The Uniform Limited Liability Company Act (ULLCA) was developed to create more uniformity but has been adopted by less than one-fifth of the states.
:p How are LLCs formed and operated?
??x
LLCs must adhere to state-specific statutes for formation and operation. These laws may differ significantly between states. Compliance with these regulations is necessary to protect members from personal liability, except in cases where they have substantially contributed to tortious actions by the company.
??x

---

#### Limited Liability of Members
Background context: LLC members generally enjoy limited liability, meaning their personal assets are protected unless they personally engage in fraudulent or negligent behavior. This protection applies even if the member actively manages the business.
:p What does the limited liability of members entail?
??x
LLC members have limited personal liability for the company's obligations, typically capped at their investment amount. However, this protection can be waived if a member engages in actions that contribute significantly to the LLC’s tortious conduct.
??x

---

#### Case in Point: Randy Coley
Background context: The case of Randy Coley illustrates an exception where personal liability might arise even for LLC members. In this example, Coley was held personally liable because he played a direct role in unauthorized cable service transmissions.
:p What does the case of Randy Coley illustrate?
??x
The case demonstrates that members of an LLC can lose their limited personal liability if they have directly participated in wrongful or fraudulent actions by the company. Here, Coley’s involvement in unauthorized cable services resulted in his personal liability for unpaid DIRECTV bills.
??x

---

#### Conditions for Imposing Liability on Members
Background context: In certain circumstances, members of an LLC may lose their limited liability, similar to shareholders in a corporation. This can happen if they guarantee payments or engage in actions that contribute significantly to the company's tortious conduct.
:p Under what conditions might personal liability be imposed on LLC members?
??x
Personal liability for LLC members may be imposed when they have guaranteed payment obligations or contributed substantially to the company’s wrongful acts, such as engaging in unauthorized business practices. For example, Randy Coley was held personally liable due to his direct involvement in illegal activities.
??x

---
#### Foreign LLCs and State Law Application
Background context: When an LLC is formed in one state but operates or has members in another state, inconsistencies can arise because different states may apply their own laws. Generally, most states follow the law of the state where the LLC was formed. However, this can lead to complications when interpreting these laws across state lines.

:p How are foreign LLCs treated regarding state law application?
??x
Foreign LLCs are typically governed by the laws of the state where they were formed, but this can create inconsistencies if disputes arise in other states with different legal interpretations or statutes. For example, if an LLC is formed in Alabama and operates in Florida, Florida courts may interpret the LLC's governance according to Alabama law.

#### Management Options in LLCs
Background context: LLC members have significant flexibility in how they manage their business. They can choose between being "member-managed" or "manager-managed." The ULLCA (Uniform Limited Liability Company Act) provides default rules for management structure, but states may differ in their statutes.

:p What are the two main options for managing an LLC?
??x
The two main options for managing an LLC are:
1. **Member-Managed**: All members participate in management decisions through majority vote.
2. **Manager-Managed**: Members designate a group of persons to manage the firm, which can include only members, both members and nonmembers, or only nonmembers.

LLC statutes generally assume member-management unless otherwise specified in the articles of organization.
x??

---
#### Fiduciary Duties in LLC Management
Background context: In a manager-managed LLC, managers owe fiduciary duties (duty of loyalty and duty of care) to both the LLC and its members. These duties are similar to those owed by corporate directors and officers to their corporation and shareholders. However, not all states follow the ULLCA.

:p Who owes fiduciary duties in a manager-managed LLC?
??x
In a manager-managed LLC, managers owe fiduciary duties (duty of loyalty and duty of care) to both the LLC and its members [ULLCA 409(a), 409(h)]. These obligations are analogous to those in corporate law where directors and officers owe similar duties to their corporation and shareholders.

#### Case Study: Polk Plumbing, LLC
Background context: The case study involves a dispute between an LLC's founders and managers over managerial authority. It highlights the importance of adhering to the terms of the operating agreement and the potential legal implications.

:p What is the key takeaway from the Polk Plumbing, LLC case?
??x
The key takeaway from the Polk Plumbing, LLC case is that managers must adhere strictly to the terms of the LLC’s operating agreement. Leslie did not have the authority under the agreement to fire two managers (Dusty and Lezanne), which led to a lawsuit and a trial outcome where damages were minimal.

The case emphasizes the importance of clear agreements and legal compliance in managing an LLC.
