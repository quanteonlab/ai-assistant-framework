#### Spotlight on the Grand Canyon—Environmental Impact Statement
The U.S. National Park Service (NPS) is managing the Grand Canyon under a new management plan that includes allowing continued rafting on the Colorado River. Environmental groups are challenging this plan, claiming it violates the wilderness status of the park.
:p When can a federal court overturn a determination by an agency such as the NPS? Explain.
??x
A federal court can overturn a determination by the National Park Service (NPS) under certain circumstances. Specifically, courts will review whether:
1. **Administrative Determination:** The NPS's decision was made within its legal authority and not arbitrary or capricious.
2. **Legal Basis:** The agency followed proper procedures and applied the correct legal standards.

In [River Runners for Wilderness v. Martin, 593 F.3d 1064 (9th Cir. 2010)], a federal appellate court upheld the NPS's management plan after considering:
- The thoroughness of the environmental impact statement (EIS).
- Whether the EIS adequately addressed the environmental impacts.
- Whether the agency followed proper procedural steps.

The court ruled that, given these factors, the decision was not arbitrary or capricious and thus could not be overturned. However, a court can overturn an administrative determination if it finds significant procedural errors or lacks substantial evidence to support the decision.

#### Superfund
This case involves contaminated land from several phosphate fertilizer plants in Charleston, South Carolina. The question focuses on liability for cleanup costs under Superfund regulations.
:p Who can be held liable for the cost of cleaning up the contaminated soil? Why?
??x
Under Superfund (CERCLA) regulations, liability for the cost of cleaning up contaminated sites can fall on multiple parties:
1. **Current Owners and Operators:** Current owners or operators of the site are often held responsible.
2. **Previous Owners and Operators:** Previous owners or operators who may have contributed to the contamination can also be liable.
3. **Joint and Several Liability:** Any party found responsible under CERCLA could potentially bear 100% of the cleanup costs, regardless of their share in causing the pollution.

In [PCS Nitrogen, Inc. v. Ashley II of Charleston LLC, 714 F.3d 161 (4th Cir. 2013)], the court ruled that Ashley II of Charleston LLC could be held liable for the cleanup costs because:
- The company was a subsequent purchaser of land contaminated by previous operations.
- It had knowledge of potential contamination when purchasing the site.

The court emphasized the joint and several liability principle, meaning Ashley could be responsible for the full cost even though it did not directly operate the plants that generated the waste.

:p Is an environmental impact statement required before the USFS implements the TMP? If so, what aspects of the environment should the USFS consider?
??x
An environmental impact statement (EIS) is typically required for significant land management actions that may have substantial environmental impacts. In this case:
- **Environmental Impact Statement Required:** Yes, an EIS might be necessary because the proposed changes involve authorized motor vehicle use in a wilderness area and dispersed camping.
  
To prepare the EIS, USFS should consider:
1. **Wildlife Impacts:** Potential effects on wildlife migration patterns and habitats.
2. **Water Quality:** Impact on local water resources due to increased traffic and camping activities.
3. **Air Quality:** Contribution to air pollution from vehicle emissions.
4. **Soil Disturbance:** Effects of vehicle use on soil stability and erosion.
5. **Historic and Cultural Resources:** Potential impacts on historic or cultural sites within the area.

In [Pryors Coalition v. Weldon, 551 Fed.Appx. 426 (9th Cir. 2014)], the court upheld the requirement for an EIS if the proposed changes significantly alter the use of natural resources and have significant environmental impacts.
