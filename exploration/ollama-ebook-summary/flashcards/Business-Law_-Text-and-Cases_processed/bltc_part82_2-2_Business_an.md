#### Dormant Commerce Clause
The dormant commerce clause is an implied restriction on state and local regulations that unduly burden interstate commerce. When a state regulation affects interstate commerce, courts must weigh the state's interest against the burden placed on interstate trade.
:p What does the term "dormant commerce clause" refer to?
??x
The dormant commerce clause refers to the principle that prohibits states from enacting legislation that discriminates against or excessively burdens interstate commerce. This is an implied restriction derived from the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which grants Congress the authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce.

#### Case in Point 2.3: Maryland Personal Income Tax Scheme
In this case, Maryland imposed personal income taxes at both the state and county levels. Residents who paid income tax in another state were allowed a credit against their state portion but not against their county portion. This led to litigation claiming that it discriminated against intrastate commerce.
:p How did the U.S. Supreme Court rule on Maryland's personal income tax scheme?
??x
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Maryland’s personal income tax scheme violated the dormant commerce clause because it placed an undue burden on interstate commerce by favoring residents whose income came from within Maryland over those who earned income in other states.

#### Supremacy Clause and Federal Preemption
Article VI of the U.S. Constitution, known as the supremacy clause, asserts that federal laws are supreme over state laws when there is a direct conflict. This means that if a federal law conflicts with a state law, the state law must be invalidated.
:p How does the supremacy clause work in practice?
??x
The supremacy clause works by stating that the Constitution, federal laws, and treaties take precedence over state laws. In cases of direct conflict between federal and state laws, the state law is rendered invalid. This principle ensures uniformity across states when a matter is regulated exclusively at the federal level.
x??

---
#### Preemption in Concurrent Areas
When Congress chooses to act exclusively in an area that also has concurrent powers (shared by both federal and state governments), preemption can occur. In such cases, a valid federal statute or regulation will take precedence over conflicting state or local laws on the same general subject.
:p What is "preemption"?
??x
Preemption occurs when Congress chooses to act exclusively in an area that also has concurrent powers. If there's a direct conflict between a federal law and a state or local law, the federal law will prevail due to preemption. The Supremacy Clause supports this by asserting that federal laws are supreme over conflicting state laws.
x??

---
#### Congressional Intent in Preemption
Determining whether Congress intended to preempt an area is crucial when there's no clear indication of exclusive federal power. Courts must analyze congressional intent, often through legislative history and context, to decide if a particular subject is regulated exclusively by the federal government.
:p How do courts determine congressional intent in preemption cases?
??x
Courts determine congressional intent by examining various factors such as legislative history, committee reports, floor debates, and the overall purpose of the legislation. If Congress intended to regulate an area exclusively through comprehensive or pervasive laws, state regulations that conflict with federal statutes may be preempted.

---
#### Incorporation Doctrine and Due Process
Background context explaining how the Supreme Court incorporated many rights from the Bill of Rights into state actions through the Fourteenth Amendment. This process involved interpreting "due process" to include specific rights listed in the first ten amendments.

:p What is the incorporation doctrine?
??x
The incorporation doctrine refers to the Supreme Court's practice of applying most of the protections found in the first ten amendments (the Bill of Rights) to state governments through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This means that neither federal nor state governments can infringe upon these rights.
x??

---
#### The Fourteenth Amendment
Background context providing details on when and why the Fourteenth Amendment was passed, its key provisions, and how it has been interpreted by the Supreme Court to expand individual liberties.

:p What did the Fourteenth Amendment do?
??x
The Fourteenth Amendment was passed in 1868 after the Civil War. It primarily aimed to protect newly freed slaves from state oppression through its Due Process Clause, which states that no state shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. Over time, the Supreme Court has interpreted this clause to incorporate many rights found in the Bill of Rights against state actions.
x??

---
#### Second Amendment and Gun Rights
Background context on how the Supreme Court has interpreted the right to bear arms as an individual right that cannot be unreasonably infringed upon.

:p What does the Second Amendment protect?
??x
The Second Amendment protects the individual right to keep and bear arms. The Supreme Court, in cases like District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), has held that this right is not absolute and can be reasonably regulated by state legislatures. For example, states may prohibit carrying concealed weapons or certain types of dangerous firearms.
x??

---
#### First Amendment Rights
Background context on the freedoms guaranteed under the First Amendment.

:p What are the main protections of the First Amendment?
??x
The First Amendment guarantees several fundamental rights:
- Freedom of religion
- Freedom of speech 
- Freedom of the press
- Right to assemble peaceably
- Right to petition the government

These freedoms protect individuals from governmental interference in their personal beliefs, expressions, and activities.
x??

---
#### Third through Eighth Amendments
Background context on key provisions in these amendments: prohibiting soldiers from being quartered in private homes without consent (Third), protecting against unreasonable searches and seizures (Fourth), ensuring due process of law (Fifth), guaranteeing trial by jury rights (Sixth, Seventh), and preventing cruel and unusual punishments (Eighth).

:p What does the Third Amendment protect?
??x
The Third Amendment protects individuals from having soldiers quartered in their homes without consent during peacetime. It restricts government power to house military personnel on private property without explicit permission.
x??

---
#### Ninth Amendment
Background context explaining that this amendment acknowledges other rights not explicitly enumerated in the Constitution.

:p What does the Ninth Amendment imply?
??x
The Ninth Amendment implies that people have additional rights beyond those specifically mentioned in the Constitution. It suggests that the listing of certain rights should not be construed as a complete list of all possible individual liberties.
x??

---
#### Tenth Amendment
Background context on this amendment, which reserves powers to states and individuals that are not delegated to the federal government.

:p What does the Tenth Amendment do?
??x
The Tenth Amendment reserves to the states or to the people any powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution. It explicitly states that powers neither granted to the federal government nor prohibited to the states remain with the states or the people.
x??

---

#### Compelling Government Interest Test
Background context explaining the concept. The Compelling Government Interest test is used to evaluate whether a law or regulation is valid, balancing the government's interest against an individual's constitutional rights. For a statute to be valid under this test, there must be a compelling governmental interest that can only be furthered by the specific law in question.

The Supreme Court has held that schools may restrict students' speech at school events if such restrictions serve a compelling interest of the school. In the case of *Morse v. Frederick* (2007), the court ruled that a banner saying "Bong Hits 4 Jesus" could be restricted as it might promote drug use, despite disagreement from some justices.

:p What is the Compelling Government Interest test used for?
??x
The Compelling Government Interest test is used to determine whether a law or regulation can balance a compelling government interest against an individual's constitutional rights, specifically in cases where the statute must serve a compelling governmental interest that cannot be achieved by any other means.
x??

---

#### Case of Morse v. Frederick
Background context explaining the concept. In *Morse v. Frederick* (2007), high school students held up a banner saying "Bong Hits 4 Jesus" at an off-campus, school-sanctioned event. The Supreme Court ruled that the school did not violate the students' free speech rights by confiscating the banner and suspending them for ten days because the banner could be reasonably interpreted as promoting drugs.

The majority opinion stated that schools can restrict student speech if it creates a substantial disruption or is likely to lead to drug use, even though several justices disagreed with this interpretation.

:p What did the Supreme Court decide in *Morse v. Frederick*?
??x
In *Morse v. Frederick*, the Supreme Court decided that schools could restrict student speech at school events if the speech was reasonably perceived as promoting illegal drugs or causing a substantial disruption.
x??

---

#### Interference with Agricultural Production Statute (Idaho)
Background context explaining the concept. The Idaho state legislature enacted the Interference with Agricultural Production statute, which criminalized making audio and video recordings of agricultural production facilities without the owner's consent. This statute was challenged by the Animal Legal Defense Fund in a federal district court as violating the First Amendment.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that the Recordings Clause is a content-based restriction on speech and cannot survive strict scrutiny, despite Idaho’s claim that creating an audiovisual recording is not protected speech.

:p What was challenged in the *Animal Legal Defense Fund v. Wasden* case?
??x
In the *Animal Legal Defense Fund v. Wasden* case, the Interference with Agricultural Production statute's Recordings Clause, which criminalized making audio and video recordings of agricultural production facilities without the owner's consent, was challenged as violating the First Amendment.
x??

---

#### First Amendment Protection of Audiovisual Recordings
Background context explaining the concept. The court in *Animal Legal Defense Fund v. Wasden* (2018) ruled that creating an audiovisual recording is protected by the First Amendment and cannot be regulated by a content-based restriction like the Recordings Clause.

The court dismissed Idaho’s argument that making audiovisual recordings is not speech protected by the First Amendment, comparing it to arguing that writing a book is not protected even though the book itself is.

:p What did the court decide about audiovisual recordings in *Animal Legal Defense Fund v. Wasden*?
??x
The court decided that creating an audiovisual recording is protected by the First Amendment and cannot be regulated by a content-based restriction like Idaho’s Recordings Clause.
x??

---

#### Internet Obscenity Laws
Background context explaining the concept. In a case challenging the law's constitutionality, the Supreme Court held that the statute is valid because it does not prohibit a substantial amount of protected speech. However, online obscenity remains a legal issue due to the difficulties in policing the internet and constitutional complexities.
:p What did the Supreme Court decide about the statute regarding internet obscenity?
??x
The Supreme Court decided that the statute is valid because it does not prohibit a substantial amount of protected speech. However, online obscenity remains a legal issue due to the challenges in enforcing such laws on the internet.
x??

---

#### Establishment Clause
Background context explaining the concept. The establishment clause prohibits the government from establishing a state-sponsored religion or passing laws that promote or show a preference for one religion over another. While it involves the separation of church and state, complete separation is not required by law. Government actions must be consistent with this constitutional mandate.
:p What does the establishment clause primarily prohibit?
??x
The establishment clause primarily prohibits the government from establishing a state-sponsored religion, passing laws that promote or show preference for one religion over another. It involves the separation of church and state but does not require complete separation.
x??

---

#### CIPA (Children’s Internet Protection Act)
Background context explaining the concept. The Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) is a federal law enacted to protect children from harmful online content by requiring public schools and libraries receiving certain federal funding to have policies blocking obscene, pornographic, or harmful-to-minors material.
:p What does CIPA primarily aim to achieve?
??x
CIPA primarily aims to protect children from harmful online content by requiring public schools and libraries receiving certain federal funding to implement policies that block obscene, pornographic, or other harmful-to-minors material.
x??

---

#### Religious Displays on Public Property
Background context explaining the concept. Religious displays on public property can be challenged as violating the establishment clause. The Supreme Court has ruled in several cases focusing on the proximity of religious symbols to nonreligious ones and balancing different religious symbols. In some instances, public displays with historical significance are not necessarily unconstitutional.
:p What did the Mount Soledad case decide about the cross display?
??x
The Mount Soledad case decided that a cross display could violate the establishment clause if it physically dominated the site and sent a strong message of endorsement for Christianity, even though war memorials can have historical as well as religious significance.
x??

---

#### Free Exercise Clause
Background context explaining the concept. The free exercise clause allows individuals to freely practice their religion without government interference or burdening. Government actions must be consistent with this constitutional mandate.
:p What does the free exercise clause guarantee?
??x
The free exercise clause guarantees that individuals can freely practice their religion without government interference or undue burden, as long as such practices do not infringe on public safety, health, or morals.
x??

---

#### Case in Point 2.11: Mount Soledad Cross
Background context explaining the concept. The case involved a challenge to a forty-foot cross on top of Mount Soledad near San Diego, arguing that it violated the establishment clause because it endorsed Christianity over other religions.
:p What was the court's decision regarding the Mount Soledad cross?
??x
The court decided that the cross violated the establishment clause because its primary effect sent a strong message of endorsement for Christianity and exclusion of non-Christian veterans. The cross physically dominated the site, contributing to this message.
x??

---

#### Due Process
Background context: The due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments ensure that no person can be deprived of life, liberty, or property without a fair procedure. This clause applies to both individuals and legal persons (corporations). Procedural due process requires proper notice and an opportunity for a hearing before any significant action is taken, while substantive due process examines the content of laws and governmental actions.
:p What does procedural due process require?
??x
Procedural due process requires that any government decision to take life, liberty, or property must be made equitably. In other words, the government must give a person proper notice and an opportunity to be heard before making such decisions. Fair procedures must be used in determining whether a person will be subjected to punishment or have some burden imposed on them.
x??

---
#### Substantive Due Process
Background context: Substantive due process focuses on the content of legislation rather than fairness of procedure. It limits what the government may do through its legislative and executive capacities, ensuring that laws are fair and reasonable in their content and further a legitimate governmental objective. Fundamental rights, such as free speech, privacy, and voting, are protected under this clause.
:p What is substantive due process?
??x
Substantive due process focuses on the content of legislation rather than the fairness of procedures. It limits what the government may do through its legislative and executive capacities, ensuring that laws are fair and reasonable in their content and further a legitimate governmental objective. If a law or other governmental action infringes upon fundamental rights, the state must have a substantial reason to justify its actions.
x??

---
#### Doyle Burns Case
Background context: The case of Doyle Burns, a nursing student expelled from her program for taking a photo without proper authorization, highlights the importance of due process. Specifically, it demonstrates that procedural due process requires an opportunity to present one's side before a decision is made.
:p What happened in the Doyle Burns case?
??x
Doyle Burns, a nursing student in Kansas, was expelled after a photograph she took ended up on Facebook and the director of nursing saw it. The school violated Burns’s due process rights by not giving her an opportunity to present her side to school authorities before expelling her.
x??

---
#### Equal Protection Clause
Background context: The Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause states that no person within a state's jurisdiction can be denied the equal protection of the laws, meaning that laws cannot treat similarly situated individuals differently. This clause also extends through the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment to apply to federal actions as well.
:p What does the Equal Protection Clause protect?
??x
The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects against laws and governmental actions that treat similarly situated individuals differently, ensuring that all persons are treated equally under the law. This includes both state and federal actions, as the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment extends its application to federal cases.
x??

---
#### Example 2 of Substantive Due Process
Background context: In situations where a law or action does not involve fundamental rights, it may still violate substantive due process if it is not rationally related to any legitimate government purpose. The test for rationality is almost impossible to fail in most circumstances.
:p When might a law or action limit the liberty of some but not others and still be considered constitutional under substantive due process?
??x
A law or action that limits the liberty of some persons but not others may violate the equal protection clause rather than substantive due process, provided it treats similarly situated individuals differently. However, if the government's actions are not rationally related to any legitimate government purpose, they could still be seen as violating substantive due process even when fundamental rights are not directly involved.
x??

---

#### State Law on Paternity Suits
Background context: A state law requires illegitimate children to bring paternity suits within six years of their births, whereas legitimate children can seek support at any time. The court will strike down this law if it is not rationally related to a legitimate government interest.
:p What does the "Rational Basis" Test require in matters of economic or social welfare?
??x
The "Rational Basis" Test requires that a classification be valid if there is any conceivable rational basis on which the classification might relate to a legitimate government interest. This test is relatively lenient and almost impossible for a law or action to fail.
x??

---

#### Kentucky Statute on Alcohol Sales
Background context: A Kentucky statute prohibits businesses that sell substantial amounts of staple groceries or gasoline from applying for a license to sell wine and liquor. The statute was challenged in court, and the rational basis test was applied.
:p How did the court rule regarding the Kentucky statute?
??x
The court ruled that the statute was rationally related to the government's interest in reducing access to products with high alcohol content. The court cited issues like drunk driving and noted that these businesses pose a greater risk of exposing the general public to alcohol, thereby justifying the restriction.
x??

---

#### Privacy Rights under U.S. Constitution
Background context: The U.S. Constitution does not explicitly mention a general right to privacy, but in 1965, the Supreme Court held that a constitutional right to privacy was implied by the First, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Ninth Amendments. Today, privacy rights are protected under various federal statutes and state constitutions.
:p What landmark case established the constitutional right to privacy?
??x
The landmark case that established the constitutional right to privacy is *Griswold v. Connecticut* in 1965. In this case, the Supreme Court held that a constitutional right to privacy was implied by the First, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Ninth Amendments.
x??

---

#### Federal Privacy Legislation
Background context: Congress has enacted several statutes over the past few decades to protect individual privacy rights, particularly concerning personal information collected by governments or private businesses. These include the Freedom of Information Act, Privacy Act, and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).
:p What is the purpose of the Freedom of Information Act?
??x
The Freedom of Information Act allows persons to request copies of any information on them contained in federal government files, thereby ensuring transparency and access to government-held information.
x??

---

#### Summary of Federal Privacy Laws
Background context: Major federal laws protecting privacy rights include the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), Privacy Act, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), among others. These statutes deal with personal information collected by governments or private businesses and define circumstances under which such information can be used or disclosed.
:p Which act defines and limits the use and disclosure of protected health information?
??x
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) defines and limits the circumstances in which an individual's "protected health information" may be used or disclosed by healthcare providers, healthcare plans, and others.
x??

---

---
#### Bill of Rights
The Bill of Rights refers to the first ten amendments to the United States Constitution, which enumerate fundamental rights and freedoms. These include freedom of speech, religion, press, assembly, right to bear arms, and protection from unreasonable searches and seizures.

:p What is the significance of the Bill of Rights in protecting individual liberties?
??x
The Bill of Rights ensures that the government cannot infringe on certain basic civil liberties without a compelling reason. For instance, the First Amendment guarantees free speech, which can be limited only under specific circumstances.
x??

---
#### Commerce Clause
The Commerce Clause grants Congress the authority to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.

:p How might the Commerce Clause affect state regulations?
??x
The Commerce Clause limits states from passing laws that unduly burden interstate commerce. For example, a state law banning all advertising by power utilities could be challenged under the Commerce Clause if it discriminates against out-of-state companies.
x??

---
#### Equal Protection Clause
The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that states provide equal protection under the law to all persons within its jurisdiction.

:p How does the Equal Protection Clause apply in a case involving an ordinance for adult entertainment establishments?
??x
Under the Equal Protection Clause, courts will consider whether a classification in a state statute or ordinance is "rational" (rational basis test) or if it involves fundamental rights (strict scrutiny). In this case, since female topless dancers are the only ones affected, the court would likely apply strict scrutiny and find that an ordinance selectively targeting females violates equal protection unless there's a significant government interest.
x??

---
#### Due Process Clause
The Due Process Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments ensures that citizens will not be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.

:p Can you explain how the Due Process Clause might affect state laws on advertising by utilities?
??x
The Due Process Clause can be used to argue that a state law violates procedural or substantive due process. In this case, the power utility could claim that the ban on advertising is overly broad and not necessary for conserving energy, thus violating their right to due process.
x??

---
#### Probable Cause
Probable cause refers to a reasonable ground upon which an officer may make an arrest or search.

:p How might probable cause be relevant in the enforcement of search warrants?
??x
Probable cause is essential for obtaining and enforcing search warrants. For example, if law enforcement needs to conduct a search, they must have evidence that suggests there's a high probability that a crime has been committed and evidence will be found at a specific location.
x??

---
#### Full Faith and Credit Clause
The Full Faith and Credit Clause requires states to recognize the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other state.

:p How might the Full Faith and Credit Clause apply in business scenarios?
??x
The Full Faith and Credit Clause ensures that legal judgments made by one state are recognized in another. In a business context, this could be relevant when dealing with contracts or judgments between states.
x??

---
#### Commerce Clause (continued)
The Commerce Clause also plays a role in determining whether a state law is preempted by federal laws.

:p How might the Commerce Clause affect preemption?
??x
If Congress has already passed a federal law that regulates interstate commerce, a state law that conflicts with it could be preempted. For example, Georgia's rear-fender mudguard statute must comply with broader federal transportation regulations.
x??

---
#### Equal Protection Clause (continued)
The Equal Protection Clause requires states to treat all individuals equally under the law.

:p How might the Equal Protection Clause apply in a business context?
??x
In a business context, the Equal Protection Clause could be used to challenge discriminatory state laws or regulations. For instance, if a state imposes higher taxes on out-of-state companies than in-state ones, it could violate equal protection.
x??

---
#### Symbolic Speech
Symbolic speech refers to conduct that conveys meaning and is protected under the First Amendment.

:p Can you give an example of symbolic speech in a business scenario?
??x
In the context of freedom of speech, Mark Wooden’s e-mail comparing an alderwoman to Jezebel can be considered symbolic speech. If he intended this as a form of protest or message, it would fall under the protection of the First Amendment.
x??

---

#### Commerce Clause
Background context: The Commerce Clause is part of Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution, which grants Congress the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states. This power has been extended by judicial interpretation to include regulation of interstate commerce. A key aspect of this clause is its application in state laws that affect interstate commerce.

In Regency Transportation, Inc., v. Commissioner of Revenue (2016), Massachusetts imposed a use tax on Regency's purchases of vehicles used for interstate operations. The trucking firm challenged the assessment as discriminatory under the Commerce Clause.

:p What is the chief consideration under the commerce clause when a state law affects interstate commerce?
??x
The chief consideration is whether the state law places an undue burden or discriminates against interstate commerce in favor of intrastate activities. In Regency Transportation, Inc., Massachusetts's use tax on vehicles used for interstate operations was challenged as discriminatory because it targeted out-of-state purchases that were part of a broader interstate business.

Regency argued that imposing the same tax on its vehicles used for interstate operations while exempting similar vehicles bought in other states violated the Commerce Clause. The court analyzed whether the tax burdened interstate commerce more than intrastate commerce and concluded that the tax was valid because it applied equally to all taxpayers subject to Massachusetts jurisdiction, not just those engaged in interstate commerce.

??x
The answer is that the chief consideration under the commerce clause when a state law affects interstate commerce is whether the law places an undue burden or discriminates against interstate commerce. In this case, while Regency argued for a discriminatory tax, the court found it valid because it applied equally to all taxpayers subject to Massachusetts jurisdiction.

```java
// Pseudocode Example:
if (commerceActivity.interstate && !commerceActivity.intraState) {
    applyUseTax(commerceActivity);
} else if (!commerceActivity.interstate && commerceActivity.intraState) {
    applyUseTax(commerceActivity);
}
```
x??

#### Freedom of Speech
Background context: The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects freedom of speech, which includes the right to express ideas and opinions without government interference. This protection is not absolute and can be limited by laws that serve important governmental interests.

In Wandering Dago, Inc., v. Destito (2018), Wandering Dago operated a food truck in Albany, New York, using branding with ethnic slurs. The New York State Office of General Services denied the application to participate in a state-owned lunch program because of the offensive branding.

:p How do principles apply to the government's regulation of the content of speech?
??x
The principles applied include balancing the protection of free speech against the interest in preventing harm, such as discrimination or offense. The U.S. Supreme Court has established tests like the "immediate danger test" and the "time, place, and manner" restrictions for evaluating content-based speech regulations.

In Wandering Dago's case, the court considered whether the state's interest in protecting public spaces from offensive content outweighed the free speech rights of the food truck owners. The court likely analyzed if the branding significantly undermined the values or safety of the lunch program participants, potentially justifying the restriction under a narrow interpretation of the First Amendment.

??x
The principles applied to the government’s regulation of the content of speech include balancing the protection of free speech against preventing harm such as discrimination or offense. In Wandering Dago's case, the state's interest in protecting public spaces from offensive branding was considered, but whether this justified the restriction under the First Amendment depended on the specific context and impact.

```java
// Pseudocode Example:
if (content.isOffensive() && event.location.isPublic()) {
    denyApplication(content);
} else if (!content.isOffensive() || !event.location.isPublic()) {
    approveApplication(content);
}
```
x??

#### Ethics - Free Speech
Background context: In Michael Mayfield's case, Edward Starski presented a "legal claim" to Mendo Mill and Lumber Co., which involved a customer injury due to improper handling of lumber. Starski claimed to be an attorney but was not. He was charged with the unauthorized practice of law.

:p Is Starski correct in arguing that creating an illusion that he is an attorney is protected by the First Amendment?
??x
Starski's argument is incorrect because while free speech protects the right to express opinions and ideas, it does not protect actions that mimic professional practices without authorization. The First Amendment applies primarily to government regulation of speech, not to unauthorized practice of professions.

In People v. Starski (2017), Starski was charged with violating a state criminal statute prohibiting the unauthorized practice of law because he presented himself as an attorney in the context of a legal claim. The court would consider that while Starski's act of presenting himself as an attorney is speech, it also involved engaging in illegal professional activity, which can be regulated by law.

??x
Starski is not correct in arguing that creating an illusion that he is an attorney is protected by the First Amendment because the protection applies to speech and not to unauthorized practice of professions. While free speech protects expressing opinions and ideas, it does not permit engaging in illegal professional activities without proper authorization.

```java
// Pseudocode Example:
if (person.isAttorney() && !legalPractice.authorized(practiceType)) {
    chargeWithUnauthorizedPractice();
} else if (!person.isAttorney()) {
    // No action needed
}
```
