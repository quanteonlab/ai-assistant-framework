**Starting Chapter:** 36-4 Franchise Termination

---

#### Accommodation Standards and Inspections
Franchisors often establish specific standards for franchise facilities, which are detailed in the contract. These contracts typically give franchisors permission to conduct periodic inspections to ensure these standards are met.

:p What does a typical contract state regarding the franchisor's ability to inspect and enforce standards?
??x
A typical contract will state that the franchisor is permitted to make periodic inspections to ensure that the standards established for the facility are being maintained. This helps in controlling quality.

#### Franchise Agreement Limitations on Sale
Franchise agreements often include clauses limiting a franchisee's ability to sell the franchise without the franchisor's permission. This control can extend to ensuring prospective franchisees meet certain customer satisfaction standards.

:p How do franchise agreements typically limit the franchisee’s ability to sell the franchise?
??x
Franchise agreements usually stipulate that the franchise cannot be sold without the franchisor's approval and that prospective franchisees must meet specific customer satisfaction standards set by the franchisor.

#### Quality Control and Liability
A franchisor has a legitimate interest in maintaining quality standards to protect its brand. However, excessive control over franchisee operations can lead to potential liability issues.

:p What is a risk for franchisors who exercise too much control over their franchisees?
??x
Excessive control by a franchisor over the operations of its franchisees can expose it to potential legal liabilities, such as being held responsible under the doctrine of respondeat superior for tortious acts committed by the franchisee’s employees.

#### National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) Case
The NLRB ruled that McDonald’s USA, LLC, could be jointly liable with its franchisees for labor and wage violations due to sufficient control over their operations.

:p How did the NLRB rule in this case?
??x
The NLRB ruled that McDonald's USA, LLC, could be held jointly liable along with several of its franchisees for labor and wage violations because McDonald’s exerts sufficient control over its franchisees.

#### Pricing Arrangements
Franchisors may require the purchase of certain supplies from them at fixed prices but cannot dictate resale prices, as this can violate antitrust laws.

:p What can a franchisor require from a franchisee regarding supply purchases?
??x
A franchisor can typically require that the franchisee purchase certain supplies from the franchisor at established prices. However, a franchisor cannot set the resale price of goods to consumers, as such price setting may be illegal under state or federal antitrust laws.

#### Franchise Termination and Duration
The duration of a franchise relationship can vary, sometimes starting with a trial period, often correlated with lease terms for business premises, which can be renewed.

:p How does the duration of a franchise contract typically correlate?
??x
The duration of the franchise contract is usually determined by mutual agreement between parties. It can start with a short trial period and may correlate with the term of the lease on the business premises, both of which are often renewable.

#### Sole Proprietorship
A sole proprietorship is a type of business owned and operated by one individual. The owner has full control over all aspects of the business, including decision-making processes, and bears unlimited personal liability for any debts or losses incurred by the business.

In this scenario, Frank plans to open a sporting goods store with his own funds, without hiring partners or taking on additional investors. He anticipates not making a profit for at least eighteen months and only making a small profit in the three years after that before expanding.
:p Would a sole proprietorship be an appropriate form for Frank’s business? Why or why not?
??x
A sole proprietorship might be suitable for Frank, given his plan to invest solely with his own funds and gradually build the business. However, there are potential drawbacks:
1. **Personal Liability**: Frank would have unlimited personal liability if the business incurs debts that cannot be paid.
2. **Resource Constraints**: Operating a business alone can limit access to additional resources such as capital, management expertise, or marketing support.
3. **Limited Expansion Potential**: Without partners or investors, significant expansion might not happen within the timeline mentioned.

In contrast, other forms like partnerships or corporations could offer more financial protection and potentially faster growth.

#### Franchise Agreement - Termination
A franchise agreement is a contract where a franchisor grants the right to operate a business using their brand and methods in exchange for fees. The agreement can include provisions for termination under specific conditions, often referred to as "for cause."

In this case, Anchor Bottling Company (the franchisee) failed to meet USB’s specified sales quota.
:p Does failing to meet the sales quota constitute “cause” for termination of the franchise agreement? Why or why not?
??x
Whether failing to meet the sales quota constitutes "cause" for termination depends on the specific terms outlined in the franchise agreement. Generally, franchisors have the right to terminate a franchise if there is a material breach of contract.

If the franchise agreement explicitly states that failing to meet specified sales quotas can be grounds for termination ("for cause"), then USB would likely be within their rights to terminate Anchor’s franchise under this condition.

#### Franchising Considerations
Franchising involves purchasing a business system from an established company. Pros include:
- Brand support and marketing
- Operational standards and training
- Access to industry knowledge

Cons may include:
- Higher initial costs for the franchise fee
- Limited control over operations due to standardized processes
- Risk of conflict with franchisor’s policies

For Maria, Pablo, and Vicky, they should consider:
1. **Costs**: Initial franchise fees and ongoing expenses.
2. **Legal Compliance**: Ensuring compliance with franchise agreements.
3. **Operational Constraints**: Adhering to strict operational standards set by the franchisor.
4. **Support vs. Control**: Balancing support from a large company against having more control over their business operations.

:p What are other aspects of franchising that Maria, Pablo, and Vicky should consider before committing to a franchise?
??x
Maria, Pablo, and Vicky should also consider:
1. **Financial Stability**: Assessing the financial health of the franchisor.
2. **Market Performance**: Evaluating the success rates of existing franchises.
3. **Training and Support**: Understanding the level of support provided by the franchisor.
4. **Legal Risks**: Reviewing potential legal issues, including non-compete clauses and dispute resolution processes.
5. **Long-term Growth Opportunities**: Exploring opportunities for expansion or advancement within the franchise network.

These factors can significantly impact their decision-making process.

#### Franchise Control and Liability
In a franchising agreement, the franchisor typically has control over certain aspects of operations to ensure consistency in branding and quality service. However, day-to-day operations are managed by the franchisee.

Chicky-D’s maintains strict policies on hiring employees, requiring regional supervisor approval for all hires. Despite this, National Foods, Inc., often bypasses these procedures, leading to violations such as Tim's racist conduct at a Chicky-D’s restaurant.
:p Is National Foods, Inc., liable for harassment by its franchise employees?
??x
National Foods, Inc., is not necessarily liable for the actions of franchise employees if it can demonstrate that it has exercised reasonable control and oversight. However, in this case:
1. **Policy Violations**: National Foods, Inc., violated their own policies by routinely approving candidates without supervisor approval.
2. **Employee Conduct**: The regional supervisors did not prevent or address Tim's racist behavior despite having the authority to do so.

Given these facts, the court may grant National’s motion for summary judgment because they failed to exercise reasonable control over employees as required under their franchise agreement and policies.

However, if Sharon can provide evidence that National Foods, Inc., knew about and condoned Tim's behavior, or had a pattern of failing to enforce their hiring standards, she might have a stronger case.

#### Disclaiming Information in Franchise Agreements (Colorado Coffee Bean, LLC v. Peaberry Coffee, Inc.)
Franchise agreements often include exculpatory clauses that limit the franchisee's reliance on information not contained in the main contract. The FTC disclosure document might contain such clauses.
:p Can a franchisor disclaim the relevance of the information it provides to franchisees?
??x
A franchisor can generally try to disclaim the relevance of certain information, but this is subject to legal scrutiny. If the disclaimer is deemed unconscionable or against public policy, courts may invalidate it.

In Colorado Coffee Bean, LLC v. Peaberry Coffee, Inc., the court considered whether an exculpatory clause in a FTC disclosure document could absolve the franchisor of liability for false information. The court held that such a clause does not automatically shield the franchisor from legal consequences if the misinformation directly harms the franchisee.
??x
The answer is nuanced, as the effectiveness of disclaimers depends on various factors including the wording and enforceability under local laws. Courts may scrutinize such clauses to ensure they are fair and reasonable.

```java
// Example Pseudocode for a disclaimer clause check
public boolean isValidDisclaimer(String disclaimer) {
    // Check if the disclaimer meets legal standards (e.g., fairness, clarity)
    if (disclaimer.contains("This franchisee shall not rely on any material outside this contract")) {
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}
```

#### Determining Territory in Franchise Relationships (Kejzar Motors, Inc. v. Kubota Tractor Corp.)
In a typical franchise relationship, the franchisor often determines the territory served by a franchisee. However, disputes can arise when new franchises are granted in overlapping or competitive areas.

:p Which party typically determines the territory served by a franchisee?
??x
The franchisor typically has the authority to determine the territory served by a franchisee. This is based on the principle that the franchisor maintains control over market distribution and brand consistency.
??x
However, if there are overlapping territories or potential competitive issues, the legal principles of territorial exclusivity and anti-competitive practices may come into play.

```java
// Pseudocode for determining territory in a franchise agreement
public String determineTerritory(String newDealerLocation) {
    // Check existing dealer locations against new location
    List<String> currentDealers = getExistingDealers();
    if (currentDealers.contains(newDealerLocation)) {
        return "Overlap detected. Territory check failed.";
    }
    return "New territory confirmed.";
}
```

#### Quality Control in Franchise Agreements (People v. JTH Tax, Inc.)
Franchise agreements often include clauses that grant the franchisor the right to control various aspects of operations, including advertising.

:p Can Liberty be held liable for misleading ads used by its franchisees?
??x
Liberty can potentially be held liable if it had significant involvement in or knowledge of the misleading advertisements. The fact that it reserved the right to control ad content and retained unilateral modification rights could indicate a level of oversight that makes it responsible.

In People v. JTH Tax, Inc., Liberty’s agreements with franchisees allowed for extensive control over ads but also gave Liberty the right to modify them unilaterally. This suggests that Liberty had a role in approving or at least being aware of the content used by its franchisees.
??x
The franchisor's level of involvement and knowledge can impact liability. If Liberty actively monitored or approved the ads, it may be liable for any violations.

```java
// Pseudocode for tracking ad approval process
public boolean approveAd(String adContent) {
    // Check if the ad content complies with specified guidelines
    List<String> guidelines = getGuidelines();
    if (guidelines.stream().anyMatch(guideline -> !adContent.contains(guideline))) {
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```

#### Quality Control in Domino's Pizza Franchise (Domino’s Pizza, LLC)
Domino’s Pizza requires franchisees to follow operational standards but treats them as independent contractors. This can create issues regarding the franchisor’s ability to enforce quality control.

:p What is an example of a situation where Domino’s might face liability?
??x
An example of a situation where Domino’s might face liability is when a franchisee fails to comply with safety requirements, leading to an accident involving customers or third parties. In such cases, Domino’s may be seen as having some level of control over the operations and could potentially be held liable.

The scenario provided involves a Domino's franchise driver who caused an accident due to vehicle safety issues. Although the franchisee (MAC Pizza Management) is described as an independent contractor, Domino’s still retained operational standards that should have been followed.
??x
Even if a franchisee is treated as an independent contractor, the franchisor can still be held liable for failing to adequately enforce and monitor compliance with operational standards.

```java
// Pseudocode for safety check at delivery
public boolean checkVehicleSafety(Vehicle vehicle) {
    // Check if the vehicle meets safety requirements (e.g., tire condition)
    String tireCondition = getTireCondition(vehicle);
    return !tireCondition.equals("bald");
}
```
