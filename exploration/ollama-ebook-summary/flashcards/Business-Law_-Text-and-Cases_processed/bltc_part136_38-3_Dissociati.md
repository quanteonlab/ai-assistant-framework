**Starting Chapter:** 38-3 Dissociation and Dissolution of an LLC

---

#### Dissociation of an LLC Member
In an LLC, dissociation refers to a member's cessation from being associated with the business. This concept is similar to partnership dissociation, where members can leave voluntarily or due to specific triggering events as outlined by state laws and operating agreements.

:p What are the events that can trigger a member’s dissociation in an LLC?
??x
Events such as voluntary withdrawal, expulsion by other members, court order, incompetence, bankruptcy, or death can trigger a member's dissociation from an LLC. Under the Uniform Limited Liability Company Act (ULLCA), these events are similar to those causing partner dissociation under the Uniform Partnership Act.
??x
---
#### Dissociation and Operating Agreements
The operating agreement in an LLC plays a crucial role in defining how dissociation impacts the business operations and financial obligations of members. Typically, if a member dissociates or dies, other members may continue to run the LLC unless the operating agreement specifies otherwise.

:p How can the operating agreement affect the continuation of an LLC after a member's dissociation?
??x
The operating agreement can outline specific provisions for how the business continues post-dissociation. For instance, if a member’s death or dissociation occurs, other members may continue to operate unless the agreement explicitly states otherwise.
??x

#### Personal Liability of LLC Members
According to Wisconsin's LLC statutes, members are generally not personally liable for debts, obligations, and liabilities of the LLC, except in cases where they act outside their capacity as a member or manager.

:p Under what conditions might an LLC member be personally liable?
??x
An LLC member is generally not personally liable for the LLC’s debts unless there is evidence that the member acted outside his or her capacity as a member. This could involve personal actions beyond managing or operating the LLC.
??x

#### Case Study: Schaefer vs Orth

In this case, the court ruled that Orth was not personally liable to pay Schaefer's wages and bonuses because these were obligations of the LLC, not individual members.

:p Why did the court rule in favor of Orth?
??x
The court ruled in favor of Orth because the operating agreement clearly stipulated that the LLC, not individual members like Orth, was responsible for paying wages and bonuses. The agreement also confirmed that distributions to Schaefer came from the LLC's funds before other allocations.
??x
---
#### Operating Agreement Provisions

The operating agreement in this case included specific sections on distributions and profits, clearly stating that payments were to be made by the LLC rather than individual members.

:p What key provisions did the operating agreement contain?
??x
The operating agreement contained clear provisions for "Distributions" and "Profits." It stated that Schaefer's wages and bonuses would be paid from the LLC’s available funds before other distributions. The "Profits" section similarly specified that any profits should first be allocated to Schaefer, subject to certain conditions.

#### LLC Winding Up Process
When an LLC is dissolved, non-wrongfully dissociated members can participate in the winding up process. This involves collecting and liquidating the LLC's assets before distributing them.

Members retain authority to perform reasonable acts during the winding up period. The assets are preserved for a reasonable time to maximize their return. Once all assets have been sold, proceeds are distributed first to pay off debts, including those owed by members who are creditors of the LLC. Next, members' capital contributions are returned. Any remaining amounts are then distributed equally or according to the operating agreement.

:p What happens during the winding up process of an LLC?
??x
During the winding up process, non-wrongfully dissociated members collect and liquidate the LLC's assets. They can preserve these assets for a reasonable time to optimize their return. Once all assets are sold, debts are paid first, followed by returning capital contributions to members. Remaining amounts are distributed according to the operating agreement or equally.

#### Special Business Forms
Special business forms combine features of other organizational structures like partnerships and corporations. These include joint ventures, syndicates, joint stock companies, business trusts, and cooperatives.

:p What are some examples of special business forms?
??x
Examples of special business forms include:
- **Joint Ventures**: Two or more parties join forces for a single project.
- **Syndicates**: A group that works together to manage a venture.
- **Joint Stock Companies**: Combine elements of corporations and partnerships.
- **Business Trusts**: Managed by trustees for the benefit of beneficiaries.
- **Cooperatives**: Owned and managed by their members.

#### Joint Venture Structure
In a joint venture, two or more parties combine resources for specific projects. Profits and losses are typically shared equally unless otherwise agreed. Joint venturers have equal management rights but can agree to delegate control.

:p What is the nature of liability in a joint venture?
??x
In a joint venture, each member can be personally liable for the venture’s debts because they share both profits and losses. This means that if the joint venture incurs debt, all members are potentially responsible for repaying it, similar to how partners in a partnership would be.

x??

---
#### Joint Venture vs Partnership
A joint venture resembles a partnership and is taxed like one. Courts apply similar principles when dealing with joint ventures as they do with partnerships. Members owe each other fiduciary duties such as the duty of loyalty.

:p How are joint ventures treated for tax purposes?
??x
Joint ventures are typically taxed similarly to partnerships, meaning income, losses, deductions, and credits pass through to the individual members’ personal tax returns without being subject to entity-level taxation.

x??

---
#### Joint Venture Management Rights
Joint venturers have equal rights to manage the venture’s activities but can agree on specific roles. One member might be given control over operations if all parties agree.

:p What is required for a joint venture member to enter into contracts?
??x
Joint venturers have authority as agents to enter into contracts that will bind the joint venture. They act on behalf of the joint venture in negotiations and agreements, ensuring that any contract entered into binds the entire venture.

#### LLC Management and Operation
In an LLC, members have significant flexibility in managing the business. They can manage the firm themselves or appoint managers to handle operations. This is typically outlined in the operating agreement, which governs how the company will be run.

:p What are Gabriel, Harris, and Ida's options with respect to the management of Jeweled Watches, LLC?
??x
The members (Gabriel, Harris, and Ida) have several options regarding the management of their firm. Under an LLC, they can manage the business themselves or appoint managers to handle day-to-day operations. This is usually detailed in the operating agreement, which outlines the roles and responsibilities of each member.

If the operating agreement specifies that members will manage the company directly, then Gabriel, Harris, and Ida would collectively oversee all aspects of the business. Alternatively, they can delegate management duties to appointed managers while retaining decision-making power as owners.

To avoid disputes, it's advisable for them to define their roles and responsibilities in writing within the operating agreement.

#### Special Business Forms
There are various types of business organizations that have unique structures and characteristics. These include business trusts, joint stock companies, cooperatives, and limited liability companies (LLCs). Each form has its own legal framework and implications.

:p What do Greener Delivery Company and Hiway Trucking, Inc., forming a business trust; Insta Equipment Company and Jiffy Supply Corporation forming a joint stock company; Kwik Mart, Inc., and Luscious Produce, Inc., forming an incorporated cooperative have in common?
??x
These forms of business organization share the characteristic that they are specialized structures designed for specific purposes. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Business Trust**: Typically involves multiple parties combining their resources under one trust. It allows for pooling assets and managing them collectively.
2. **Joint Stock Company**: Shares ownership among shareholders who can buy and sell shares, making it a publicly tradable company in many cases.
3. **Incorporated Cooperative**: A cooperative that is incorporated as a legal entity, allowing members to jointly own the business and share profits based on their usage.

The commonality lies in their structure of shared ownership or management and the pooling of resources for specific goals. However, each has distinct legal and operational implications:
- Business trusts are managed by trustees who hold assets for beneficiaries.
- Joint stock companies have a clear mechanism for raising capital through shares.
- Cooperatives operate under principles of one member, one vote, sharing profits based on usage.

The shared characteristic is that they offer unique structures to manage business operations with collective ownership or management.

#### The Limited Liability Company
Limited liability companies (LLCs) provide members with limited personal liability for the company's debts and obligations. However, profit distribution can be complex if not specified in the operating agreement.

:p In John, Lesa, and Tabir forming a limited liability company where John contributes 60 percent of the capital and Lesa and Tabir each contribute 20 percent, what law will the court apply to resolve their dispute over profit division?
??x
In most states, if there is no agreement on how profits will be divided, courts typically refer to state LLC statutes. These statutes often provide default rules for profit distribution based on capital contributions or equal shares.

If John assumes that his 60 percent contribution entitles him to 60 percent of the profits and Lesa and Tabir assume equal division (20% each), a court would most likely apply:
- **Default Provisions**: Most state LLC laws specify default profit distribution rules. These can include equal shares or proportional to capital contributions.
- **Equitable Distribution**: Courts may also consider factors like value of services provided, risks taken, and other relevant circumstances.

To avoid this dispute, it's crucial for the members (John, Lesa, and Tabir) to clearly define their profit-sharing agreements in the operating agreement. This ensures that there is no ambiguity and reduces the likelihood of legal conflicts.

#### Special Business Forms
In evaluating business organizations like joint stock companies and business trusts, understanding the nature of these entities can help in assessing potential risks.

:p Discuss Bateson Corp.'s concern when considering contracts with a joint stock company on one hand and a business trust on the other?
??x
Bateson Corp. is concerned about the potential limits on liability associated with entering into large capital outlay contracts with two different types of business organizations: a joint stock company and a business trust.

1. **Joint Stock Company**:
   - **Ownership Structure**: Shares are publicly tradable, meaning ownership can be easily transferred.
   - **Liability**: Shareholders have limited personal liability but may face risks if the company fails to meet its obligations under contract terms.
   - **Contractual Risk**: Large capital outlays could expose Bateson Corp. to financial risk if the joint stock company breaches the contract.

2. **Business Trust**:
   - **Ownership Structure**: Typically involves pooling assets managed by trustees for beneficiaries, who are often sole proprietors.
   - **Liability**: Beneficiaries have limited personal liability for the trust’s obligations but may still face risks associated with the business's performance.
   - **Contractual Risk**: Similar to a joint stock company, there is risk of financial loss if the business trust fails to meet contractual terms.

To address their concerns, Bateson Corp. should consider:
- The financial stability and track record of both organizations.
- The specific provisions in the contracts regarding liability and indemnification.
- Seeking legal advice on how these structures might impact their obligations under the contracts.

By understanding the nature of each structure, Bateson can better assess risks and negotiate more favorable terms to protect its interests.

#### Joint Venture
A joint venture involves multiple parties combining resources for a specific project or business purpose. However, disputes over management and operations can arise if roles are not clearly defined.

:p In Holiday Isle Resort & Marina Inc.'s "joint-venture agreement" with Rip Tosun, what legal issues might arise due to the terms of this agreement?
??x
The joint-venture agreement between Holiday Isle Resort & Marina, Inc., and Rip Tosun involves several potential legal issues:

1. **Management Authority**:
   - The agreement gives Rip Tosun "full authority as to the conduct of the business," which could create conflicts if Holiday also wants to manage certain aspects.
   
2. **Competitive Practices**:
   - The prohibition on Tosun competing without Holiday’s approval does not prevent Holiday from competing, creating a potential breach of contract or unfair competition issue.

3. **Interest Transfer**:
   - Tosun's sale of half his interest in Rip’s to Thomas Hallock may affect the joint venture dynamics and could lead to disagreements about control and management.
   
4. **Operational Interference**:
   - Holiday’s actions, such as opening a competing restaurant next door and diverting employees and equipment from Rip’s, violate the spirit if not the letter of the agreement.

To address these issues, both parties should have clearly defined roles, mutual agreements on competitive practices, and provisions for managing disputes. Additionally, formalizing all changes in ownership or management can help prevent legal conflicts.

#### Bluewater Logistics, LLC v. Williford (Jurisdictional Requirements)
Background context: In *Bluewater Logistics, LLC v. Williford*, the court discussed jurisdictional requirements for a lawsuit involving limited liability companies (LLCs). The case highlighted that the members of an LLC can have different citizenship statuses, which affects the determination of diversity jurisdiction.
:p Does the district court in *Fadal Machining Centers, LLC v. Mid-Atlantic CNC, Inc.* have diversity jurisdiction over this case?
??x
The district court has no diversity jurisdiction because Robert O’Shea, a New Jersey citizen, is a common member of SP MAG Holdings, which owns 10% of MAG. Since one party (Robert O’Shea) does not meet the diversity requirement, complete diversity cannot be established.
In this case:
- Fadal Machining Centers LLC: Not specified
- Mid-Atlantic CNC Inc.: New Jersey corporation
- SP MAG Holdings: Delaware LLC with a member (Silver Point Capital Fund and SPCP Group III), both of which have Robert O’Shea as a common member
Complete diversity requires that no party on one side of the litigation be a citizen of the same state as any party on the other side. Here, the presence of a New Jersey citizen (Robert O’Shea) means complete diversity is not present.
```java
// Pseudocode to illustrate
if (!isCitizenOfSameState(partiesOnOneSide, partiesOnOtherSide)) {
    // Diversity jurisdiction exists
} else {
    // No diversity jurisdiction due to common citizenship among members
}
```

#### Fadal Machining Centers, LLC v. Mid-Atlantic CNC, Inc. (Jurisdictional Requirements)
Background context: In *Fadal Machining Centers, LLC v. Mid-Atlantic CNC, Inc.*, the legal question centers on whether a federal district court has diversity jurisdiction based on the citizenship of parties involved.
:p Does the district court have diversity jurisdiction in this case?
??x
The district court does not have diversity jurisdiction because Silver Point Capital Fund and SPCP Group III are Delaware entities, but they share a common member (Robert O’Shea) who is a New Jersey citizen. Since one party on each side of the litigation is a citizen of the same state, complete diversity cannot be established.
In this scenario:
- Fadal Machining Centers LLC: Not specified
- Mid-Atlantic CNC Inc.: New Jersey corporation
- SP MAG Holdings (10% owned by Silver Point Capital Fund and SPCP Group III): Both are Delaware entities with a common member (Robert O’Shea)
Complete diversity is essential for federal court jurisdiction, but the presence of Robert O’Shea as a common member means that complete diversity is not present.
```java
// Pseudocode to illustrate
if (!isCitizenOfSameState(partiesOnOneSide, partiesOnOtherSide)) {
    // Diversity jurisdiction exists
} else {
    // No diversity jurisdiction due to shared citizenship among members
}
```

#### Siloam Springs Hotel, LLC v. Century Surety Co. (Jurisdictional Requirements)
Background context: In *Siloam Springs Hotel, LLC v. Century Surety Co.*, the legal issue is whether a federal district court can exercise diversity jurisdiction over an insurance dispute between two corporations.
:p Can the federal court in this case exercise diversity jurisdiction?
??x
The federal court can exercise diversity jurisdiction because there is complete diversity of citizenship among the parties involved: 
- Siloam Springs Hotel, LLC (Oklahoma corporation with principal place of business in Arkansas)
- Century Surety Company (Ohio corporation with principal place of business in Michigan)

Since no party on one side of the litigation is a citizen of the same state as any party on the other side, complete diversity exists.
```java
// Pseudocode to illustrate
if (isCompleteDiversityBetweenParties(partiesOnOneSide, partiesOnOtherSide)) {
    // Diversity jurisdiction exists
} else {
    // No diversity jurisdiction due to lack of complete diversity
}
```

#### Norman v. Crow Wing Cooperative Power & Light Co. (Special Business Forms)
Background context: In *Norman v. Crow Wing Cooperative Power & Light Co.*, the legal issue is whether members of a member-owned electrical cooperative can be held jointly liable for the actions of the cooperative.
:p Can the members of Crow Wing Cooperative Power & Light Company be held jointly liable for its acts?
??x
The members of Crow Wing Cooperative Power & Light Company cannot be held jointly liable for the cooperative's acts. Under the doctrine of separate legal personality, a member-owned electrical cooperative operates as a distinct legal entity from its individual members.
If it is found that Crow Wing acted negligently:
- Crow Wing Cooperative Power & Light Company would be held liable
- Individual members are not personally liable unless there is evidence of personal involvement or misappropriation of funds

```java
// Pseudocode to illustrate
if (foundNegligentActBy(Crow_Wing)) {
    // Only the cooperative can be held liable, not its members
} else {
    // Further investigation needed
}
```

#### Vision Metals, Inc. v. TCEQ (Limited Liability)
Background context: In *Vision Metals, Inc. v. TCEQ*, the case involves a lawsuit filed by Vision Metals against Crow Wing Cooperative Power & Light Company for groundwater contamination caused by their pipe manufacturing facility.
:p What implications does limited liability have in this scenario?
??x
Limited liability means that only Vision Metals, Inc., as the legal entity, is responsible for the obligations stemming from the plan issued by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). The individual shareholders or members of Vision Metals are not personally liable for these obligations.
If found negligent:
- Liability is solely with Vision Metals
- Shareholders/members may face personal liability only if there is evidence of personal misconduct, such as fraud or misappropriation of corporate assets

```java
// Pseudocode to illustrate
if (foundNegligentActBy(Vision_Metals)) {
    // Liability applies to the company, not individuals
} else {
    // Further investigation needed
}
```
