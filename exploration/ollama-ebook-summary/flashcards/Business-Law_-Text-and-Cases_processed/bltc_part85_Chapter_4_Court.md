#### Ethical Dilemma: Reporting Suspected Misconduct

**Background context**: As Dickman’s supervisor, you have been informed that she is frequently away from her desk and often makes personal phone calls. You also know that she has started running two side businesses while at work.

:p Should you report your findings to management based on the evidence of suspected misconduct?
??x
Reporting your findings involves a complex ethical dilemma. On one hand, it is essential to maintain integrity and accountability within the workplace. However, doing so could impact Dickman's employment status and potentially affect her well-being given her disability. The key questions are: Does the evidence justify reporting? Is there an alternative approach that respects confidentiality and due process?

Code examples can illustrate potential actions:
```java
// Pseudocode for evaluating whether to report findings
public void evaluateReporting(String[] observations) {
    if (observations.contains("personal phone calls") && 
        observations.contains("side businesses")) {
        // Consider reporting but follow proper procedures.
        System.out.println("Report to HR with documented evidence.");
    } else {
        System.out.println("Further investigation is needed before reporting.");
    }
}
```

#### Ethical Dilemma: Investigating and Terminating an Employee

**Background context**: You are a supervisor who has received complaints about Dickman's behavior, including making personal calls and running side businesses. The Health Center requires more evidence to justify termination but you are unsure if you can search her computer.

:p Is there an ethical problem in investigating and possibly firing a long-term employee?
??x
Investigating and potentially terminating a long-term employee raises significant ethical concerns. Key issues include due process, confidentiality, and the impact on the employee's well-being. The Health Center must balance maintaining organizational integrity with respecting the rights of employees, especially those under disability restrictions.

Code examples can illustrate potential actions:
```java
// Pseudocode for considering investigation steps
public void investigateEmployee(String[] complaints) {
    if (complaints.size() > 2 && containsPersonalCalls(complaints)) {
        // Consider investigating further.
        System.out.println("Begin formal investigation and gather evidence.");
    } else {
        System.out.println("Further information needed before proceeding with an investigation.");
    }
}
```

#### Ethical Dilemma: Retaliation Claims

**Background context**: Dickman filed a claim against the Health Center, alleging retaliation for being disabled and put on workplace restrictions. She was convicted of civil and criminal violations.

:p How would you frame the ethical dilemma that the Health Center faced in this case?
??x
The ethical dilemma revolves around whether the Health Center’s actions were appropriate given the context of Dickman's disability and work restrictions. The key issues are: Was there a legitimate reason for initiating investigations? Were these actions justified or did they constitute retaliation?

Code examples can illustrate potential actions:
```java
// Pseudocode for assessing allegations of retaliation
public void assessRetaliationClaims(String[] claims) {
    if (claims.contains("disability") && 
        claims.contains("workplace restrictions")) {
        // Consider the context and evidence.
        System.out.println("Evaluate whether investigations were justified or retaliatory.");
    } else {
        System.out.println("Review existing policies and procedures for fairness.");
    }
}
```

#### Ethical Dilemma: Employee’s Perspective

**Background context**: As an employee, you experience severe back pain at work and find relief by moving around. You have started side businesses due to your impending retirement.

:p Is it fair to terminate an employee who is under disability restrictions?
??x
Terminating an employee with disabilities raises complex ethical questions. The Health Center must balance its need for productivity and compliance with legal obligations and ethical standards, such as accommodating employees' needs and ensuring equitable treatment. Terminating an employee on disability may be seen as a form of discrimination if the termination is not justified by legitimate business reasons.

Code examples can illustrate potential actions:
```java
// Pseudocode for evaluating fairness in termination
public void evaluateTerminationFairness(Employee employee) {
    if (employee.isOnDisability() && 
        !isLegitimateReasonForTermination(employee)) {
        System.out.println("Consider accommodations and alternatives before terminating.");
    } else {
        System.out.println("Follow standard procedures to ensure fair treatment.");
    }
}
```
x??

#### Stakeholders in the Ethical Dilemma

**Background context**: The Health Center must balance its need for productivity with Dickman's disability, civil and criminal convictions, and potential retaliation claims.

:p Who are the stakeholders involved in this ethical dilemma?
??x
Stakeholders include the Health Center (management, HR), Dickman, other employees, patients, and the state. Each party has different interests and concerns, such as maintaining organizational integrity, complying with laws, protecting employee rights, ensuring patient safety, and upholding public trust.

Code examples can illustrate potential actions:
```java
// Pseudocode for identifying stakeholders
public void identifyStakeholders() {
    List<String> stakeholders = new ArrayList<>();
    stakeholders.add("Health Center Management");
    stakeholders.add("HR Department");
    stakeholders.add("Dickman (Employee)");
    stakeholders.add("Other Employees");
    stakeholders.add("Patients");
    stakeholders.add("State Authorities");
    
    System.out.println("Identified key stakeholders: " + stakeholders);
}
```
x??

#### Ethical Theories in the Dilemma

**Background context**: Various ethical theories can guide decisions, such as utilitarianism, deontology, and virtue ethics.

:p What ethical theories would you use to guide your decision?
??x
Ethical theories that could guide the decision include:

- **Utilitarianism (Consequentialism)**: Focuses on maximizing overall happiness or minimizing harm. Consider the impact of different actions on all stakeholders.
  
- **Deontology**: Emphasizes duty and rules, ensuring fairness and respect for employee rights. Evaluate whether terminating an employee aligns with professional codes and legal obligations.

- **Virtue Ethics**: Focuses on character traits like integrity, compassion, and wisdom in making decisions that promote ethical behavior.

Code examples can illustrate potential actions:
```java
// Pseudocode for applying ethical theories
public void applyEthicalTheories(String theory) {
    switch (theory) {
        case "utilitarianism":
            System.out.println("Evaluate the consequences of termination vs. accommodation.");
            break;
        case "deontology":
            System.out.println("Ensure actions respect rules and employee rights.");
            break;
        case "virtue ethics":
            System.out.println("Act with integrity, compassion, and wisdom in decision-making.");
            break;
    }
}
```

#### Legal Compliance
Background context: The company emphasizes strict adherence to all laws and regulations in every community where they operate. This includes statutes, safety standards, wage and hour laws, anti-trust laws, and more. Compliance ensures ethical business practices and maintains good relations with public officials.

:p What are the key legal compliance principles mentioned?
??x
The key legal compliance principles include:
- Complying with all statutes.
- Cooperating with authorities.
- Respecting all public officials and their positions.
- Avoiding conflicts of interest with public officials.
- Ensuring disclosure and reporting requirements are met.
- Meeting safety and security standards for products.
- Exceeding ecological standards in every community.
- Compliance with wage and hour laws.
- Adhering to anti-trust laws.
- Protecting inside information.

This ensures that the company operates within legal boundaries and fosters a culture of ethical business practices.
??x
The answer details the core principles, ensuring they are understood as part of maintaining a compliant business environment:
```java
// Pseudocode for checking compliance with regulations
public class ComplianceChecker {
    public void checkStatutes() { /* Code to ensure all statutes are followed */ }
    public void cooperateWithAuthorities() { /* Code to facilitate cooperation with authorities */ }
    public void respectPublicOfficials() { /* Code to handle interactions with officials respectfully */ }
    // Other methods for different compliance checks
}
```

These goals ensure members are satisfied, which is essential for business success.
??x
The answer details the specific measures to maintain member satisfaction:
```java
// Pseudocode for maintaining member satisfaction
public class MemberSatisfaction {
    public void provideHighQualityProducts() { /* Code to source and sell high-quality products */ }
    public void ensureSafeShoppingEnvironment() { /* Code to make warehouses safe for members */ }
    public void checkProductSafety() { /* Code to verify all sold products meet safety standards */ }
    // Other methods for ensuring overall member satisfaction
}
```

#### Employee Care
Background context: The company places a high value on its employees, considering them the most important asset. Every employee is trained and treated as an ambassador of the brand, with a focus on providing a safe work environment, fair wages, and career growth opportunities.

:p What are the core principles for taking care of employees?
??x
The core principles for taking care of employees include:
- Providing a safe work environment.
- Paying fair wages.
- Ensuring jobs are both challenging and fun.
- Treating every employee's departure as a failure and loss to the organization.
- Training employees in their roles and encouraging personal and professional growth.
- Promoting from within to achieve at least 80 percent of management positions being filled by current employees.

These principles aim to create a supportive work culture that values each employee's contribution.
??x
The answer outlines the key principles for employee care:
```java
// Pseudocode for employee care
public class EmployeeCare {
    public void ensureSafeEnvironment() { /* Code to maintain a safe workplace */ }
    public void payFairWages() { /* Code to ensure fair compensation */ }
    public void makeJobsChallengingAndFun() { /* Code to keep jobs engaging and fun */ }
    public void trainEmployees() { /* Code to provide training for growth and improvement */ }
    public void promoteFromWithin() { /* Code to facilitate internal promotions for management roles */ }
}
```

#### The Role of the Judiciary in American Government
Background context: The judiciary's role involves interpreting and applying laws to specific situations. It includes federal and state constitutions, statutes, administrative law, and common law decisions.
:p What is the primary function of the judiciary?
??x
The primary function of the judiciary is to interpret and apply laws to specific situations, ensuring that actions by other branches (legislative and executive) are in line with constitutional provisions. This role helps maintain the balance of power among the three branches of government as established by the U.S. Constitution.
x??

---

#### Judicial Review
Background context: Judicial review allows courts to determine whether laws or actions of the legislative or executive branch are constitutional. The Supreme Court's decision in Marbury v. Madison (1803) formally recognized this power.
:p What is judicial review?
??x
Judicial review is the process by which courts, particularly the Supreme Court, can declare laws or executive actions unconstitutional. It enables the judiciary to check and balance the powers of the legislative and executive branches. The concept was established in the 1803 Marbury v. Madison case.
x??

---

#### Origins of Judicial Review
Background context: The power of judicial review is not explicitly mentioned in the U.S. Constitution but was formally recognized by the Supreme Court in Marbury v. Madison (1803).
:p How did the United States Supreme Court establish the power of judicial review?
??x
The United States Supreme Court established the power of judicial review in 1803 through its decision in the case Marbury v. Madison. In this decision, the Court stated that it is within their authority to interpret laws and determine whether they are constitutional.
```java
public class MarburyCase {
    public static void establishJudicialReview() {
        System.out.println("The Supreme Court established judicial review through its ruling in Marbury v. Madison (1803).");
    }
}
```
x??

#### American Court Systems
Background context: The U.S. has a complex system of courts, including federal and state systems. Federal courts are not superior to state courts; they operate independently under Article III of the Constitution.
:p How does the U.S. court system work?
??x
The U.S. court system consists of both federal and state courts. The federal courts derive their authority from Article III of the U.S. Constitution, while state courts are granted power by individual state constitutions. Federal courts handle cases involving federal law or disputes between states, whereas state courts deal with local laws and disputes within a state. There is no hierarchical superiority; they operate independently.
x??

#### Business Context: Dispute Resolution
Background context: Evan Heron, an executive at DSMC, negotiates contracts and faces a dispute over chip pricing with a Canadian company. The dispute was resolved through arbitration rather than litigation, which resulted in DSMC being awarded $800 million by the arbitration panel.
:p What method did DSMC use to resolve its dispute?
??x
DSMC used arbitration as the method to resolve its dispute with a Canadian smartphone company over chip pricing. Arbitration is an alternative form of dispute resolution where parties agree to have a neutral third party make a binding decision, rather than going through traditional court litigation.

---
#### Effect of Diversity of Citizenship on Lawsuit
Background context: In a lawsuit, diversity of citizenship affects whether parties can choose to file their case in federal court. If the citizens of the states involved are diverse (i.e., different states), then they may bring suit in federal court. Conversely, if they are not diverse, this limits where they can sue.
:p How does the presence—or lack—of diversity of citizenship affect a lawsuit?
??x
In a lawsuit, the presence or absence of diversity of citizenship impacts whether parties can file their case in federal court based on the rules for diversity jurisdiction.

If all parties involved have different states of citizenship, then they may bring suit in federal court. However, if the parties are not diverse (i.e., citizens of the same state), the lawsuit must be filed in state court unless an exception applies.
??x
---

---
#### Court's Conclusion on Diversity of Citizenship
Background context: The passage discusses a specific case where the court concluded that the parties were not diverse and therefore, Mala did not have a right to a jury trial. This conclusion was based on the District Court’s underlying factual findings for clear error.
:p What did the court conclude with respect to the parties’ diversity of citizenship in this case?
??x
The court concluded that Crown Bay was likely a citizen of Florida, making the parties not diverse under federal jurisdiction rules. Consequently, Mala does not have a right to a jury trial in this case.

Key points:
- The District Court’s factual findings were reviewed for clear error.
- Mala has failed to present credible evidence proving Crown Bay's citizenship outside of Florida.
- This lack of diversity means the lawsuit cannot be heard by federal court based on diversity jurisdiction.
??x

---
#### Exclusive Versus Concurrent Jurisdiction
Background context: The passage explains that when both state and federal courts have the power to hear a case, it is an example of concurrent jurisdiction. When only one type of court can hear a case (exclusive jurisdiction), this is true for specific types of cases such as federal crimes or bankruptcy.
:p What are exclusive versus concurrent jurisdiction in the context of lawsuits?
??x
Exclusive and concurrent jurisdiction refer to the types of jurisdiction that determine where a lawsuit can be filed:

- **Concurrent Jurisdiction**: Both state and federal courts have the authority to hear certain cases, such as those involving diversity of citizenship. The parties can choose which court to file their case in.
  
- **Exclusive Jurisdiction**: Only one type of court has the power to hear specific types of cases. For example:
  - Federal crimes
  - Bankruptcy
  - Most patent and copyright claims
  - Suits against the United States
  - Some areas of admiralty law

When concurrent jurisdiction exists, parties can choose whether to file their case in a federal or state court based on factors like available remedies, courthouse location, judge's reputation, etc.
??x

---
#### Jurisdiction in Cyberspace
Background context: The passage discusses the challenges courts face when determining personal jurisdiction over defendants who interact with them only through websites. A "sliding-scale" standard is mentioned to help determine if a court can exercise jurisdiction based on the defendant’s internet activities.
:p What does the concept of exclusive and concurrent jurisdiction illustrate?
??x
The concepts of exclusive and concurrent jurisdiction illustrate how different types of cases can be heard by specific courts:

- **Exclusive Jurisdiction**: When only federal or state courts have the authority to hear a case. For example, federal crimes are exclusively within federal court's jurisdiction.
  
- **Concurrent Jurisdiction**: Both federal and state courts share the power to hear certain cases, such as those involving diversity of citizenship.

The choice between filing in federal versus state court can be influenced by various factors including availability of remedies, geographic convenience, and judicial reputation. Courts use a "sliding-scale" standard to determine personal jurisdiction over defendants based on their internet activities.
??x
---

---
#### Sliding-Scale Standard for Internet Jurisdiction
Background context: The passage mentions the sliding-scale standard used by courts to determine if they can exercise personal jurisdiction over out-of-state defendants through their web activities. This involves three types of business contacts, each with specific rules regarding jurisdiction.
:p What is the "sliding-scale" standard in determining internet jurisdiction?
??x
The "sliding-scale" standard helps determine whether a court can exercise personal jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant based on their internet activities. It considers different levels of contact:

- **Substantial Business**: If the defendant conducts substantial business online (such as contracts and sales), then jurisdiction is proper.

- **Advertising and Solicitation**: If the defendant only advertises or solicits via the internet, this generally does not provide a sufficient basis for jurisdiction unless there are other significant contacts.

- **Negligent Publication**: If the defendant negligently publishes content that affects users in a particular state, it may be grounds for jurisdiction.
??x
---

#### Change of Venue
Background context explaining the change of venue. The Internet and 24/7 news reporting have diminished the significance of choosing a specific venue for trials, as information is now widely available to all communities. Courts rarely grant requests for a change of venue due to this widespread access to information.
:p What has decreased the importance of venue in legal proceedings?
??x
The availability of the Internet and 24/7 news reporting have significantly reduced the significance of venue, as everyone has instant access to the same information about a purported crime. As a result, courts no longer frequently grant requests for a change of venue.
x??

---

#### Standing to Sue
Background context explaining standing to sue, which is essential before a party can bring a lawsuit in court. The concept involves having a sufficient stake or interest in the matter at hand. A person may represent another individual if that other individual cannot do so due to incapacity (e.g., minors or mentally incompetent persons).
:p What does "standing to sue" mean?
??x
Standing to sue means that the party filing a lawsuit has a legally protected interest at stake in the litigation. This involves three elements: harm, causation, and remedy. The party must have suffered an invasion of a legally protected interest (harm), there must be a causal connection between the conduct complained of and the injury (causation), and it must be likely that a favorable court decision will remedy the injury suffered (remedy).
x??

#### Case in Point 4.5
Background context explaining the case involving Harold Wagner who obtained a loan from M.S.T. Mortgage Group and later sued over alleged improper mortgage assignments.
:p What did Harold Wagner file his lawsuit against?
??x
Harold Wagner filed a lawsuit against CitiMortgage, Inc., claiming that the lenders had improperly assigned the mortgage loan. The federal district court ruled that Wagner lacked standing to contest the assignment under Texas law because only parties directly involved in an assignment can challenge its validity.
x??

#### State and Federal Court Systems
Background context explaining the structure of state and federal court systems. Each state has its own system, while there is also a separate federal court system with a different organizational framework.
:p What are the key components of most state court systems?
??x
Most state court systems include several levels or tiers of courts:
1. Trial Courts of Limited Jurisdiction: These handle specific types of cases, such as small claims or traffic violations.
2. Trial Courts of General Jurisdiction: These handle more serious criminal and civil cases.
3. Appellate Courts (Intermediate Appellate Courts): These review decisions from trial courts to ensure they followed the correct legal procedures.
4. The State's Highest Court (Often Called the Supreme Court): This is the final court in which a case can be heard, reviewing appeals from lower courts.

The structure of these systems varies by state but typically follows this hierarchy.
x??

---

#### State Court Systems
Background context explaining that no two state court systems are exactly the same. However, many states have trial courts of limited and general jurisdiction, appellate courts, and a supreme court.
:p What is common in most state court systems?
??x
Most state court systems include several levels or tiers of courts:
1. Trial Courts of Limited Jurisdiction: These handle specific types of cases, such as small claims or traffic violations.
2. Trial Courts of General Jurisdiction: These handle more serious criminal and civil cases.
3. Appellate Courts (Intermediate Appellate Courts): These review decisions from trial courts to ensure they followed the correct legal procedures.
4. The State's Highest Court (Often Called the Supreme Court): This is the final court in which a case can be heard, reviewing appeals from lower courts.

The structure of these systems varies by state but typically follows this hierarchy.
x??

---

#### Federal Court System
Background context explaining the federal court system, which includes trial courts, circuit courts, and the Supreme Court. The federal court system handles cases involving federal law or when disputes arise between states.
:p How is the federal court system structured?
??x
The federal court system is structured as follows:
1. Trial Courts: These are district courts where most civil and criminal cases are initially heard.
2. Circuit Courts: These are appellate courts that hear appeals from district courts within their respective circuits.
3. Supreme Court: This is the highest court in the federal system, hearing appeals from lower courts.

The federal court system handles cases involving federal law or when disputes arise between states.

#### TWC's Jurisdiction and Res Judicata
Background context: The case involves Johnson's claim that she was denied a full adjudication of her breach of contract claim by the Texas Workforce Commission (TWC) because it refused to consider her arguments regarding whether Oxy violated its Educational Assistance Policy. Additionally, the defendants argue res judicata should bar Johnson’s claims since they were previously decided by the TWC.
:p What is the key issue in Johnson's case concerning the Texas Workforce Commission?
??x
Johnson argues that the TWC refused to consider her arguments regarding whether Oxy violated its Educational Assistance Policy because it does not interpret contracts between employers and employees. The defendants, however, argue res judicata should bar her claims since they were previously decided by the TWC.
x??

---

#### Res Judicata in Johnson's Case
Background context: Res judicata generally precludes the same parties from litigating the same claim that has been definitively resolved in a final judgment. In this case, the issue is whether res judicata bars Johnson’s common law breach of contract claim.
:p How does the appellate court rule on the application of res judicata in Johnson's case?
??x
The appellate court holds that res judicata does not bar Johnson’s breach of contract claim because the TWC explicitly refused to decide the key question of fact—whether Oxy violated its Educational Assistance Policy when it withheld Johnson’s final wages. Since this issue was not addressed by the TWC, the order is not considered final for res judicata purposes.
x??

---

#### Questions of Fact vs. Questions of Law
Background context: Differentiating between questions of fact and questions of law is crucial in legal proceedings. The Texas Workforce Commission (TWC) does not interpret contracts but enforces state laws like the Texas Payday Law, while courts generally decide both factual disputes and legal interpretations.
:p Can you explain the difference between a question of fact and a question of law?
??x
A question of fact involves determining what actually happened or existed in a given situation, such as whether Oxy violated its Educational Assistance Policy. A question of law concerns the application of legal principles to specific facts, such as interpreting contract terms.
In this case, the TWC is limited to enforcing state laws and cannot interpret contracts between employers and employees, making it a question of law.
x??

---

#### Legal Environment Overview
Background context: The legal environment involves understanding which entities can rule on different types of issues. Courts generally handle questions of fact and law, while administrative agencies like the TWC have specific jurisdictions, such as enforcing state laws but not interpreting contracts between employers and employees.
:p Which entity should decide a question involving the interpretation of an employment contract?
??x
A question involving the interpretation of an employment contract should be decided by a court or tribunal with jurisdiction over contractual disputes. The Texas Workforce Commission (TWC) is limited to enforcing state laws like the Texas Payday Law and cannot interpret contracts between employers and employees.
x??

---

#### Appellate Court's Role
Background context: Appellate courts review decisions of lower courts to ensure they are correct according to law. In this case, an intermediate appellate court reversed the lower court’s decision because it determined that res judicata does not apply due to the TWC's failure to address the key factual issue.
:p What role did the appellate court play in Johnson's case?
??x
The appellate court reversed the lower court's decision and remanded the case for a trial on the merits. The appellate court held that res judicata does not bar Johnson’s breach of contract claim because the TWC explicitly refused to decide the key factual issue—whether Oxy violated its Educational Assistance Policy.
x??

---

#### Supreme Court in State Cases
Background context: In state cases, the highest state courts (usually called supreme or court of appeals) have the final word on questions of state law. Their decisions are binding unless overruled by the U.S. Supreme Court when federal issues are involved.
:p What is the significance of a decision made by the highest state court?
??x
A decision made by the highest state court (e.g., supreme or court of appeals) is final on questions of state law, meaning that lower courts and tribunals must follow these decisions unless they are overruled by the U.S. Supreme Court when federal issues are involved.
