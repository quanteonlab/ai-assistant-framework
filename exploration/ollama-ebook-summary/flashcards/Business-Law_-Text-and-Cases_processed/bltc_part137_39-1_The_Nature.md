**Starting Chapter:** 39-1 The Nature and Classification of Corporations

---

#### Corporate Entity Formation and Legal Status
A corporation is a legal entity created by state law. It can have one or more owners (shareholders) who operate under a distinct name from themselves. Both individuals and businesses can be shareholders, and they own shares that grant them ownership rights in the corporation.
:p What defines a corporation as a separate legal entity?
??x
A corporation is defined as a separate legal entity because it operates under its own distinct name, has authority to act independently of its shareholders, and enjoys many of the same rights and privileges as natural persons. This separation means that the corporation can sue or be sued in its own name.
??x

---

#### Board of Directors and Corporate Governance
The responsibility for overall management of a firm is given to a board of directors elected by the shareholders. The board makes policy decisions and hires corporate officers who run daily business operations.
:p Who holds the primary managerial authority in a corporation?
??x
The board of directors holds the primary managerial authority in a corporation. They are elected by shareholders, make key policy decisions, and oversee the hiring of corporate officers to manage day-to-day operations.
??x

---

#### Shareholder Rights and Responsibilities
When an individual buys stock, they become a shareholder with ownership rights. Shareholders can sue the corporation or be sued, and in certain circumstances, they can sue on behalf of the corporation as well.
:p What rights do shareholders have?
??x
Shareholders have several key rights including the right to sue the corporation, be sued by it, and under specific conditions, sue on its behalf. They are also owners of shares which confer voting rights at shareholder meetings and other ownership benefits.
??x

---

#### Limited Liability of Shareholders
The primary advantage of a corporation is the limited liability for shareholders, meaning they are not personally liable for corporate obligations beyond their investment in the company. However, this can be waived under certain circumstances.
:p What does limited liability mean for shareholders?
??x
Limited liability means that shareholders are not personally responsible for the debts and liabilities of the corporation except to the extent of their investment. This provides a significant protection against financial loss but allows creditors to seek personal assets in extreme cases.
??x

---

#### Corporate Statutes and Legislation
Corporations exist as creatures of statute, meaning they are created by state law and can vary significantly from state to state. The Model Business Corporation Act (MBCA) is influential in shaping corporate statutes, with many states following its guidelines.
:p How do corporations differ across different states?
??x
Corporations differ across states due to variations in their creation through state-specific laws. Despite this variation, most states follow the guidelines set by the Revised Model Business Corporation Act (RMBCA), which provides a standardized framework for corporate law.
??x

This section covers the fundamental aspects of corporations, including their legal status, governance structure, shareholder rights and responsibilities, and the statutes that govern them. Understanding these concepts is crucial for anyone involved in corporate law or business operations.
:p What are the main points covered in this section?
??x
The main points cover the creation and recognition of corporations as separate legal entities, the roles and powers of boards of directors, shareholder rights and responsibilities, limited liability protection, and the statutory framework governing corporate actions. These concepts form the foundation for understanding how corporations operate under U.S. law.

#### Legal Environment for Foreign Corporations in Pennsylvania
Background context: The case deals with a foreign corporation, Drake, that conducted extensive business activities in Pennsylvania without obtaining the required certificate of authority. This situation led to legal issues when Drake sued Polyflow for non-payment. Pennsylvania requires foreign corporations to obtain a certificate of authority before conducting any substantial business within the state.
:p What is the primary issue discussed in this case?
??x
The primary issue is whether a foreign corporation, Drake, was required to obtain a certificate of authority to conduct its business activities in Pennsylvania and sue Polyflow for non-payment.
x??

---
#### Certificate of Authority Requirement
Background context: The court determined that Drake needed to obtain a certificate of authority because it conducted regular, systematic, and extensive business operations within Pennsylvania. This includes maintaining an office, entering into contracts, and shipping goods. The requirement is based on the state statute which mandates a certificate for foreign corporations conducting substantial business in Pennsylvania.
:p What legal action did the court take regarding Drake's case?
??x
The court held that Drake needed to obtain a certificate of authority before commencing its business operations in Pennsylvania and suing Polyflow. Without this certificate, Drake was not permitted to prosecute its action against Polyflow.
x??

---
#### Appellate Court Decision
Background context: The trial court initially allowed Drake to proceed with the lawsuit against Polyflow. However, on appeal, a state intermediate appellate court reversed the judgment, ruling that Drake's failure to obtain a certificate of authority invalidated its right to sue in Pennsylvania. This decision highlights the strict requirements for foreign corporations operating within the state.
:p What was the outcome of the appellate court's decision?
??x
The outcome was that the trial court’s judgment in favor of Drake was reversed because it did not comply with the requirement to obtain a certificate of authority before suing Polyflow in Pennsylvania. The appellate court ruled that Drake could not prosecute its action without the necessary certificate.
x??

---
#### Reason for Reversal
Background context: The reversal occurred because Drake engaged in significant business activities within Pennsylvania, which typically require a certificate of authority. Despite attempting to collect a debt through litigation, these activities extended beyond mere lawsuit filings and included conducting local business operations, entering contracts, and shipping goods.
:p Why was the trial court's decision overturned?
??x
The trial court’s decision was overturned because Drake engaged in extensive business activities within Pennsylvania that typically require a certificate of authority. The court found that Drake's actions went beyond merely filing suit or attempting to collect a debt; they included maintaining an office, entering into contracts, and shipping goods, all of which are regular business operations requiring the certificate.
x??

---
#### Business Conduct Requirement
Background context: The case emphasizes that foreign corporations conducting substantial business in Pennsylvania must obtain a certificate of authority. This requirement applies regardless of whether the lawsuit concerns in-state or out-of-state conduct. Drake’s actions were deemed to be transactional and extensive, thus requiring compliance with this statutory requirement.
:p What does the court's decision imply about doing business in Pennsylvania?
??x
The court's decision implies that foreign corporations must obtain a certificate of authority if they engage in substantial business operations within Pennsylvania, whether or not their lawsuits involve in-state transactions. This ruling underscores the strict regulatory environment for businesses operating across state lines.
x??

---
#### Non-Payment Case Analysis
Background context: The case involves Polyflow’s non-payment for goods delivered from out-of-state shipments. Despite receiving merchantable goods, Polyflow failed to pay, leading to a lawsuit by Drake in Pennsylvania. However, the court's decision hinged on whether Drake had obtained the necessary certificate of authority.
:p Why was the initial judgment in favor of Drake reversed?
??x
The initial judgment in favor of Drake was reversed because it did not comply with the requirement to obtain a certificate of authority before suing Polyflow for non-payment. The court found that Drake’s extensive business activities in Pennsylvania warranted this certificate, and its absence invalidated the lawsuit.

#### Public vs. Private Corporations
Background context: The text differentiates between public and private corporations, explaining their distinct purposes and ownership structures. A public corporation is formed by the government for political or governmental purposes, whereas a private corporation is created for profit and owned by private individuals. Examples of both types are provided to illustrate these distinctions.
:p What distinguishes a public corporation from a private corporation?
??x
A public corporation is formed by the government to serve political or governmental purposes, while a private corporation is created for profit and owned by private individuals. Public corporations can still serve public purposes but are not necessarily publicly held (traded on stock exchanges).
x??

---
#### Nonprofit Corporations
Background context: The text introduces nonprofit or not-for-profit corporations as entities formed for purposes other than making a profit, such as private hospitals, educational institutions, charities, and religious organizations. These organizations are distinct from publicly held corporations.
:p What is the main characteristic of nonprofit corporations?
??x
The main characteristic of nonprofit corporations is that they are formed for purposes other than making a profit, often serving charitable or educational objectives. Examples include private hospitals, educational institutions, charities, and religious organizations.

#### Court Decision and Shareholder Compensation
Background context: The court ordered the defendants to repay Olympic nearly $6 million, which was to be distributed among its shareholders. This decision was affirmed on appeal.

:p What is the outcome of the court case involving Olympic?
??x
The court ruled that the defendants must pay Olympic approximately $6 million, and this amount will be distributed amongst Olympic's shareholders. The ruling was upheld upon appeal.
x??

---
#### S Corporation Overview
Background context: A close corporation can elect to operate as an S corporation if it meets specific requirements outlined in Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code.

:p What is an S corporation?
??x
An S corporation is a type of closely held business entity that chooses to be taxed under Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code. By doing so, it avoids double taxation (i.e., corporate income tax and dividend distribution taxes) while still retaining many advantages of a corporation, such as limited liability.

If a corporation elects S status, its income passes through directly to shareholders who then pay personal income tax on their share of profits.
x??

---
#### Important Requirements for S Corporation Status
Background context: The text outlines several key requirements that must be met for a corporation to qualify as an S corporation. These include being a domestic entity, having no more than 100 shareholders, and not having multiple classes of stock.

:p What are the important requirements for S corporation status?
??x
For a corporation to elect S corporation status, it must meet these key criteria:
1. The corporation must be a U.S.-based (domestic) entity.
2. It cannot be part of an affiliated group of corporations.
3. Shareholders can only be individuals, estates, trusts, or certain tax-exempt organizations; partnerships and non-qualifying trusts are excluded, while corporations may qualify under specific circumstances.
4. The corporation must have no more than 100 shareholders.
5. Only one class of stock is allowed; however, not all shareholders need to hold the same voting rights.
6. Shareholders cannot be nonresident aliens.

These requirements ensure that S corporations remain manageable and conducive to simpler tax structures without sacrificing essential benefits like limited liability.
x??

---
#### Effect of S Election on Taxation
Background context: An S corporation is taxed differently than a regular corporation, with income passing through to shareholders who pay personal income taxes. This avoids double taxation.

:p What are the key effects of an S election?
??x
An S corporation offers several key tax benefits:
1. Corporate income passes directly to shareholders.
2. Shareholders then pay personal income taxes on their share of profits.
3. This structure prevents the "double taxation" that regular corporations face (corporate level and individual dividend distribution).
4. Shareholder tax brackets may be lower than corporate tax rates, providing additional savings.

These benefits enable S corporations to retain earnings for future business purposes more effectively while reducing overall tax liability.

#### Professional Corporations
Background context: Professionals such as physicians, lawyers, dentists, and accountants can incorporate under the rules of professional corporations. These entities are often denoted with specific suffixes like P.C., S.C., or P.A.

:p What is a professional corporation?
??x
A professional corporation is an entity specifically designed for professionals (such as doctors, lawyers, dentists, etc.). It is typically identified by designations like:
- Professional Corporation (P.C.)
- Service Corporation (S.C.)
- Professional Association (P.A.)

The laws governing these corporations are generally similar to those of regular business corporations. However, there are some unique aspects related to liability and conduct standards.
x??

---
#### Liability in Professional Corporations
Background context: Shareholders in professional corporations can face unique liability risks, particularly for malpractice committed by other professionals within the firm.

:p What is the liability structure in a professional corporation?
??x
In a professional corporation, shareholder-owners are generally protected from torts committed by others in the firm, except those related to:
1. Malpractice.
2. Breach of duty to clients.

Additionally, some courts may treat these corporations as partnerships for liability purposes, making each professional potentially liable for malpractice committed within their scope of business.

#### Corporate Formation Process
Background context: The process by which a corporation comes into existence is a fundamental aspect of business organization. This includes understanding the steps and requirements involved, especially concerning state laws and formalities.

:p What are the primary steps in forming a corporation?
??x
The primary steps in forming a corporation include:
1. Selecting the State of Incorporation: Businesses choose a state based on factors like tax benefits or legal advantages.
2. Securing an Appropriate Corporate Name: The name must be unique and cannot mislead others, often including specific words to indicate corporate status.
3. Preparing Articles of Incorporation: This document formalizes the corporation’s existence and includes key details such as the number of authorized shares.

x??
---
#### Selecting the State of Incorporation
Background context: The state chosen for incorporation can significantly impact a company's operations due to varying corporate laws and incentives offered by different states. Delaware is often favored for its business-friendly environment, while others might prioritize cost or convenience.

:p Why do businesses choose to incorporate in certain states?
??x
Businesses choose to incorporate in specific states primarily because:
1. Tax Benefits: Some states offer more favorable tax environments.
2. Legal Advantages: States like Delaware have historically had less restrictive laws and provisions that favor corporate management.
3. Convenience and Cost: Incorporating in the state where the corporation's primary business will be conducted can simplify logistics.

x??
---
#### Securing an Appropriate Corporate Name
Background context: The name of a corporation is crucial for legal and market purposes, ensuring uniqueness and preventing confusion or deception. State laws require a formal search to confirm the availability of the chosen name.

:p How does the state ensure that corporate names are unique?
??x
States ensure that corporate names are unique through the following processes:
1. Name Search: A preliminary search is conducted to check if the proposed name already exists.
2. Name Availability Confirmation: The chosen name must be distinct from and not deceptively similar to existing corporate names within the state.

x??
---
#### Preparing Articles of Incorporation
Background context: The articles of incorporation are a critical document in establishing a corporation, detailing essential information such as the company's name, authorized shares, and other foundational aspects. This document serves as a primary source of authority for future organizational functions.

:p What is included in the articles of incorporation?
??x
The articles of incorporation typically include:
1. The name of the corporation.
2. The number of shares of stock the corporation is authorized to issue (and possibly specifying a par value and types of stock).
3. Additional details as required by state laws, such as corporate purposes or initial directors.

Example code for preparing an article might look like this in pseudocode:
```pseudocode
class ArticlesOfIncorporation {
    string companyName;
    int authorizedShares;
    float parValuePerShare = 0.20; // Example value
    string typesOfStock;

    function prepareArticle() {
        // Logic to compile and finalize the articles based on inputs
        print("Articles of Incorporation prepared for " + companyName);
    }
}
```
x??

#### De Jure Corporations
De jure corporations are those that have substantially complied with all conditions precedent to incorporation. In most states, and under RMBCA 2.03(b), the filing of articles of incorporation by the secretary of state is conclusive proof that all mandatory statutory provisions have been met.
:p What does de jure mean in the context of corporation existence?
??x
De jure means "rightful and lawful" existence. In this case, it refers to a corporation that has met most but not necessarily all conditions required for incorporation as long as they are minor errors.
x??

---

#### De Facto Corporations
If there is a substantial defect in the formation process of a corporation, such as failing to hold an organizational meeting to adopt bylaws, de facto corporations may come into play. Some states recognize this common law doctrine, while others do not.
:p What is a de facto corporation?
??x
A de facto corporation exists despite significant defects in its formation if certain criteria are met: 1) A state statute for valid incorporation; 2) Good faith attempt to comply with the statute; and 3) Undertaking business activities as a corporation. 
In states recognizing this doctrine, such as Mississippi, New York, Ohio, and Oklahoma, courts may treat an entity as if it were legally incorporated despite these defects.
x??

---

#### Corporation by Estoppel
Corporations that hold themselves out to be corporations but have not properly incorporated can face legal challenges. The estoppel doctrine prevents them from denying corporate status in a lawsuit under certain circumstances.
:p What is the estoppel doctrine?
??x
The estoppel doctrine prevents an entity from denying its status as a corporation when it has represented itself as such and entered into contracts based on that representation, even if it was not properly incorporated. This doctrine ensures fairness by preventing parties from benefiting from their own misrepresentations.
x??

---

#### Legal Implications of Defects
If there are substantial defects in the incorporation process, the corporation may lack legal existence, making the incorporators personally liable for any contracts or tortious acts committed during this period.
:p What happens if a corporation has substantial defects in its formation?
??x
If a corporation has substantial defects in its formation and lacks de jure status, it is considered non-existent under law. This means that the incorporators could be held personally liable for any actions taken by the entity prior to proper incorporation.
For example:
```java
if (!isProperlyIncorporated()) {
    throw new CorporationNotValidException();
}
```
This code checks if a corporation is properly incorporated and throws an exception if not, indicating legal non-existence.

#### Cloud Computing and Nationality

Background context: The term "cloud" refers to digital data storage services provided over the internet, typically by large corporations like Apple, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. These companies have invested heavily in server infrastructure globally to store various types of user data securely.

:p What is cloud computing, and why does it involve questions about national jurisdiction?
??x
Cloud computing involves storing and managing data through remote servers owned or leased by third parties, often referred to as "the cloud." It raises questions about national jurisdiction because the data can be stored in servers located in different countries. This situation complicates legal issues such as privacy and law enforcement access.

Code examples are not directly applicable here but for context, consider how a simple database query might differ based on server location:
```sql
-- Example SQL queries might look different depending on the cloud provider's infrastructure.
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE country = 'USA';
```
x??

#### Microsoft vs. U.S. Government

Background context: The U.S. government issued warrants to Microsoft for e-mails related to a narcotics case, stored in a server located in Ireland. Microsoft refused, citing concerns over extraterritorial jurisdiction and privacy.

:p What did Microsoft argue against the U.S. government's warrant request?
??x
Microsoft argued that the U.S. government does not have the authority to issue a warrant for information stored outside its borders, as doing so would threaten the privacy of U.S. citizens who use services hosted internationally.

Code examples are not directly applicable here but an example of how such a situation might be handled in legal terms:
```legal
The court reasoned that because the data was stored in Ireland, the U.S. government's warrant for a U.S.-based company to provide information from a foreign server is overreaching.
```
x??

---

#### Google vs. U.S. Government

Background context: The U.S. government issued a similar warrant to Google but used different arguments regarding how data was stored and managed globally.

:p How did Google respond differently compared to Microsoft?
??x
Google made the same general privacy and jurisdictional arguments as Microsoft, but it pointed out differences in how cloud data is stored. Specifically, while Microsoft had stored e-mails exclusively in Ireland, Google separated its data components across multiple locations for network efficiency.

Code examples are not directly applicable here but an illustrative example might be:
```java
// Simplified representation of data distribution logic
public class CloudData {
    private Map<String, String> dataLocations;

    public void storeDataInMultipleLocations(String data) {
        // Logic to distribute data across multiple servers
        for (Entry<String, String> entry : dataLocations.entrySet()) {
            System.out.println("Storing " + data + " in " + entry.getKey());
        }
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### The CLOUD Act

Background context: In 2018, the U.S. Congress passed the CLOUD Act to address these jurisdictional issues by allowing warrants for extraterritorial access under certain conditions.

:p What is the main purpose of the CLOUD Act?
??x
The primary purpose of the CLOUD Act is to clarify and provide legal authority for law enforcement agencies to obtain data from cloud services stored in other countries, provided that the foreign government meets specific standards set by U.S. law.

Code examples are not directly applicable here but an example might be:
```java
// Pseudo-code representation of how a warrant request under CLOUD Act might work
public class DataProvider {
    private Map<String, String> dataLocations;

    public boolean canIssueWarrant(String country) {
        // Check if the foreign government meets CLOUD Act standards
        return countriesThatMeetCLOUDActRequirements.contains(country);
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Impact on Privacy

Background context: The CLOUD Act was passed to resolve disputes over extraterritorial data access, ensuring that law enforcement can obtain necessary information while also safeguarding privacy.

:p How might the CLOUD Act affect U.S. citizens' cloud storage privacy?
??x
The CLOUD Act may increase the risk of government surveillance for U.S. citizens storing their information in the cloud, as it provides legal grounds for warrants to be issued even if data is stored abroad. However, it also includes provisions designed to protect privacy and ensure that foreign governments meet certain standards.

Code examples are not directly applicable here but an example might be:
```java
// Pseudo-code representation of how a citizen's rights under CLOUD Act might be protected
public class PrivacyProtection {
    private boolean isForeignGovernmentApproved;

    public void checkPrivacyPolicy() {
        if (isForeignGovernmentApproved) {
            System.out.println("Your privacy is protected by the CLOUD Act.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Your privacy may not be fully protected under CLOUD Act standards.");
        }
    }
}
```
