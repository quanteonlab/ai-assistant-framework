#### Temporary Entry and Hiring of Nonimmigrant Visa Workers

Background context: The U.S. government has a system for temporary entry and hiring of nonimmigrant visa workers, ensuring that no U.S. worker is qualified, willing, and able to take the job before allowing foreign workers to be hired.

:p What does this system ensure when employers hire nonimmigrant visa workers?
??x
This system ensures that the employer has demonstrated a genuine need for foreign labor because there are no suitable U.S. workers available for the position. It involves a detailed process of advertising, interviewing U.S. applicants, and proving that the job requirements are essential to the business operations.
x??

#### H-1B Visa Program

Background context: The H-1B visa program is one of the most common and controversial programs allowing foreign workers in specialty occupations to work temporarily in the United States.

:p What is the H-1B visa system used for?
??x
The H-1B visa system is used to allow highly skilled foreign workers to enter and work temporarily in the U.S. It requires that applicants have specialized knowledge typically attained through a bachelor's degree or higher, and they can stay in the United States for three to six years, working only for their sponsoring employer.
x??

---

#### Labor Certification

Background context: To obtain an H-1B visa, employers must first file a Labor Certification application (ETA 9035) to ensure that hiring a foreign worker will not adversely affect U.S. workers.

:p What does the Labor Certification application entail?
??x
The Labor Certification application requires the employer to agree to pay at least equal wages to other individuals with similar experience and qualifications, show that the hiring will not harm domestic workers, and inform U.S. workers of their intent to hire a foreign worker by posting the form.

x??

---

#### H-2 Visas

Background context: The H-2 visa provides for temporary admission of foreign agricultural workers or workers in other seasonal or occasional services/activities of a temporary or intermittent nature.

:p What is an H-2 visa used for?
??x
The H-2 visa is used to bring foreign workers into the United States temporarily for specific jobs, such as agricultural labor that is of a seasonal nature. These visas are issued when there is no U.S. worker available or willing to perform the job.
x??

---

#### O Visas

Background context: The O visa allows entry for individuals with extraordinary ability in sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics who have received national or international acclaim.

:p What qualifies a person for an O visa?
??x
A person can qualify for an O visa if they have demonstrated extraordinary ability through sustained national or international acclaim and are coming to the United States temporarily to continue their work in their field. This visa is not limited to specific industries but covers any area of extraordinary ability.
x??

---

#### L Visas

Background context: The L visa allows a company’s foreign managers or executives, as well as certain foreign specialty occupation employees, to work inside the U.S. under certain conditions.

:p What does an L visa allow?
??x
An L visa allows companies to transfer their foreign managers or executives and some specialized workers from abroad to work in the United States for up to seven years. It is often used by multinational corporations to move key personnel.
x??

---

#### E Visas

Background context: The E visa category includes various subcategories such as E-1, E-2, and E-3, which permit entry of foreign investors or entrepreneurs who are coming temporarily under the terms specified for their respective categories.

:p What is an E visa used for?
??x
The E visa is used to allow foreign investors or entrepreneurs to enter the U.S. temporarily to conduct international trade or investment activities. It includes subcategories like E-1 (traders and investors) and E-2 (investors and key employees of an investor firm).
x??

---

#### State Immigration Legislation

Background context: Prior to 2010, federal law was the sole authority on immigration matters. However, Arizona enacted a strict immigration enforcement law that required state officials to verify and report illegal immigrants.

:p What did Arizona's immigration law require?
??x
Arizona’s immigration law required law enforcement officials to identify and charge illegal immigrants present in Arizona, potentially leading to their deportation. It mandated that immigrants carry their documents at all times and allowed police to check a person’s immigration status during any lawful stop or arrest.

#### Refusal to Bargain Collectively
The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is responsible for overseeing union elections and preventing employers from engaging in unfair labor practices. When an employer refuses to bargain collectively with a designated employee representative, it constitutes an unfair labor practice. The NLRB has the authority to investigate such charges and file complaints against employers.
:p What does it mean when an employer refuses to bargain collectively?
??x
When an employer declines to engage in negotiations with the duly designated representatives of employees regarding terms and conditions of employment, this is considered a violation of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). The refusal can include not negotiating at all or unreasonably delaying the process.
x??

---
#### Unfair Labor Practices: Prohibiting Flyers Outside Stores
An employer commits an unfair labor practice if they prohibit union members from distributing flyers outside their store premises when non-union members are allowed to do so. This restriction violates the NLRA, as it discriminates against unions and can limit employee organizing efforts.
:p What is the consequence for prohibiting union members from distributing flyers outside a store?
??x
If an employer prohibits union members from distributing flyers while allowing non-union members to do so, they are engaging in unfair labor practices. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) may file a complaint against such employers and issue a cease-and-desist order if violations are found. This order can be enforced by a federal appellate court.
x??

---
#### Good Faith Bargaining
Under the NLRA, both employers and unions have a duty to bargain in good faith. Mandatory bargaining subjects include wages, working hours, and other terms of employment. Refusal to bargain over these subjects is an unfair labor practice that can lead to complaints filed with the NLRB.
:p What are the mandatory subjects for good faith bargaining?
??x
The mandatory subjects for good faith bargaining under the NLRA include wages, working hours, and other conditions of employment. These subjects must be negotiated by both employers and unions in a fair and reasonable manner. Failure to bargain over these topics can result in an unfair labor practice complaint.
x??

---
#### Workers Protected by the NLRA
The NLRA protects employees and job applicants from discrimination during hiring processes. Additionally, individuals hired by a union for organizing purposes are considered employees under the NLRA. Even temporary workers may qualify for protection if they are working directly for a business.
:p Who is protected under the NLRA?
??x
The NLRA protects both current employees and job applicants from unfair labor practices. It also extends protections to individuals who are hired by unions to organize companies, as well as to temporary workers employed directly by businesses. These protections aim to ensure fair treatment in the workplace and during hiring processes.
x??

---
#### Labor-Management Relations Act (LMRA)
The LMRA, passed in 1947, aims to regulate unfair union practices while preserving certain union rights. It prohibits closed shops but allows for union shops. The act also bans unions from refusing to bargain with employers, engaging in specific types of picketing, and featherbedding. States can pass right-to-work laws that limit union membership requirements.
:p What does the LMRA allow and prohibit?
??x
The LMRA allows for union shops but prohibits closed shops, where union membership is required as a condition of employment. It also bans unions from refusing to bargain with employers, engaging in certain types of picketing, and featherbedding (unnecessarily hiring more employees than necessary). The act also permits states to pass right-to-work laws that restrict mandatory union membership for employment.
x??

---

---
#### Mutuality of Interest Requirement for Union Representation
Mutuality of interest is a key requirement for forming an appropriate bargaining unit. This means that all workers to be represented by the union must share common interests and goals, which typically include having similar jobs and working close enough together that they can benefit from collective representation.
:p What does mutuality of interest mean in the context of union representation?
??x
Mutuality of interest refers to the shared commonality among workers in terms of their job roles and workplace proximity. It ensures that a proposed union represents workers who have similar interests and would benefit equally from unionization, as it aligns their goals and challenges.
x??

---
#### NLRB Rules for Expedited Elections
The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) rules changed in 2015 to expedite the process of organizing elections. These changes significantly reduced the time between the filing of a petition and the actual election, from an average of thirty-eight days down to as little as ten days.
:p What are the NLRB's recent changes regarding election procedures?
??x
The NLRB has implemented new rules that expedite the process for organizing elections. Previously, elections took about 38 days on average; now, they can be held within just 10 days after a petition is filed. This rapid process favors unions by giving employers less time to prepare and respond to organizing campaigns.
x??
---

---
#### Pre-Election Hearing Requirements
As part of the expedited election procedures, the NLRB mandates that a company hold a pre-election hearing within eight days after receiving a petition for an organizing election. On the day before this hearing, the employer must submit a "statement of position" outlining all arguments it intends to present against the union.
:p What is required during the pre-election hearing?
??x
During the pre-election hearing, the company must hold a meeting within eight days after receiving a petition for an organizing election. The company also needs to provide a "statement of position" on the day before the hearing, detailing all arguments it intends to make against the union.
x??
---

---
#### Employer Controls During Union Election Campaigns
Employers have significant control over unionizing activities that take place on their property and during working hours. They may restrict or prohibit certain activities, as long as they provide a legitimate business reason for doing so. For example, Amanti Enterprises can ban all union solicitation in public areas of the store.
:p What controls do employers have during union election campaigns?
??x
Employers can control unionizing activities on their property and during working hours by limiting or prohibiting certain actions, provided they have a legitimate business reason. They may restrict union-related activities to specific times (like coffee breaks) or locations within the workplace.
x??
---

---
#### Employer's Campaign Against Unionization
During union election campaigns, employers are allowed to campaign against the union, but must do so responsibly. The NLRB closely monitors and regulates these employer campaigns to ensure they do not cross into illegal territory such as issuing threats or making false promises.
:p What can an employer do during a union election campaign?
??x
Employers can campaign against the union, although their tactics are strictly regulated by the NLRB. They should avoid issuing threats (e.g., "If you support the union, you'll lose your job") and must ensure that any statements made are truthful.
x??

#### Unlawful Actions by Dealership and AutoNation
Background context: The dealership and AutoNation engaged in various actions that unlawfully frustrated their employees' protected rights to engage in concerted activity and organize a union. These actions included creating an impression of surveillance, coercive interrogation, and soliciting employee grievances with the goal of frustrating the union organizing drive.

:p What specific action did Grobler take regarding Juan Cazorla's attendance at union meetings?
??x
Grobler created a coercive impression of surveillance by commenting on technician Juan Cazorla’s attendance at union meetings. For example, Grobler asked Cazorla why he was in such a rush to leave work and suggested that Cazorla had "that meeting" to go to.
```java
public class Example {
    // Code representing a scenario where a manager comments on an employee's union activities
    public void manageEmployeeActivity(Technician technician) {
        if (technician.attendedUnionMeeting()) {
            System.out.println("Why are you in such a rush? Do you have that meeting to go to?");
        }
    }
}
```
x??

---
#### Coercive Interrogation by Berryhill
Background context: Berryhill, the dealership’s service director, engaged in coercive interrogation when he called individual employees into his office and asked them about union activities. This action was performed under circumstances that created a sense of coercion.

:p How did Berryhill conduct interrogations with employees?
??x
Berryhill called employees individually into his office to ask them about union activity. The dealership's service director, who held an authoritative position, was present during these meetings. Given the one-on-one setting and the authority dynamics involved, these interviews created a coercive environment.
```java
public class Example {
    // Code representing Berryhill’s interrogation of employees
    public void conductInterrogation(Employee employee) {
        System.out.println("How can I help you today? Have you heard anything about union activities?");
        System.out.println("I am working on the problems and in progress with solutions.");
    }
}
```
x??

---
#### Coercive Interrogation by AutoNation Vice President
Background context: Davis, an AutoNation vice president, engaged in coercive interrogation when he asked a technician about his feelings regarding the union election. This was part of broader efforts to solicit employee complaints and implicitly promise grievance remedies.

:p What did Davis do during his meeting with employees?
??x
Davis held a meeting where he solicited employee complaints and, upon hearing that management had been unresponsive in the past, said that employees could call him or talk to him at any time. This was an effort to imply that grievances would be addressed as part of the broader strategy to frustrate the union organizing drive.
```java
public class Example {
    // Code representing Davis’s meeting with employees
    public void holdMeeting(Employee employee) {
        System.out.println("How do you feel about the union election?");
        if (employee.hasComplaints()) {
            System.out.println("We are working on resolving these issues.");
            System.out.println("You can call me or talk to me anytime for any concerns.");
        }
    }
}
```
x??

---
#### Overly Broad No-Solicitation Policy
Background context: AutoNation promulgated a no-solicitation policy in their employee handbook that was overly broad, prohibiting any solicitation on company property at any time. This policy aimed to restrict employees from engaging in union activities.

:p What was the content of AutoNation's no-solicitation policy?
??x
AutoNation’s no-solicitation policy prohibited any solicitation on company property at any time. This overly broad policy was intended to limit employees' ability to engage in union-related activities during work hours and on company premises.
```java
public class Example {
    // Code representing the enforcement of AutoNation's no-solicitation policy
    public void enforceNoSolicitationPolicy(Employee employee) {
        if (employee.isSoliciting()) {
            System.out.println("Sorry, solicitation is not allowed here.");
        }
    }
}
```
x??

#### Overtime Pay Eligibility for Saldona
Background context: In the U.S., employees are generally entitled to overtime pay if they work more than 40 hours per week. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) mandates that covered, non-exempt employees receive at least one and a half times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked over 40 in a workweek.

:p Would Saldona have been legally entitled to receive overtime pay at a higher rate?
??x
Saldona would likely be legally entitled to receive overtime pay. Since he works an average of 50 hours per week and the FLSA requires that non-exempt employees be paid time-and-a-half for any hours worked over 40 in a workweek, Saldona should have been eligible for this additional compensation.
??x
---
#### Leave Length for Saldona’s Spouse
Background context: The Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) entitles certain employees to take unpaid, job-protected leave for specified family and medical reasons. Employees are generally entitled to 12 weeks of leave in a 12-month period.

:p What is the maximum length of time Saldona would have been allowed to take leave to care for his injured spouse?
??x
Under the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA), Saldona would be allowed up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave to care for his injured spouse. This period can be taken in a single block or in shorter increments as needed.
??x
---
#### Polygraph Tests and Aimer Winery
Background context: Federal law restricts the use of polygraph tests by employers due to their controversial nature and potential invasions of privacy. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has prohibited employers from requiring polygraph tests for most employment purposes.

:p Under what circumstances would Aimer have been allowed to require an employee to take a polygraph test?
??x
Aimer Winery would not typically be allowed to require an employee like Saldona to take a polygraph test. Federal law, specifically the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), generally prohibits employers from requiring polygraph tests for employment purposes due to their potential to invade privacy and inaccuracies.
??x
---
#### Reinstatement of Saldona’s Position
Background context: When an employer eliminates a position, they must consider whether it constitutes a violation of federal labor laws. The key employee exception under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act allows employers to eliminate positions if certain criteria are met.

:p Would Aimer likely be able to avoid reinstating Saldona under the key employee exception?
??x
Aimer would likely not be able to avoid reinstating Saldona under the key employee exception. The WARN Act requires employers with 100 or more employees to provide 60 days' notice before layoffs, and it also has a "key employee" exception that allows temporary position eliminations if certain conditions are met. However, in this case, Aimer only had 63 employees, so they would need to follow the full WARN process, including offering Saldona his job back.
??x
---
#### Debate on Overtime Pay Laws
Background context: The debate centers around whether state and federal laws requiring overtime pay are necessary or overly burdensome in a highly competitive labor market. Arguments against these laws suggest that they increase business costs without significant benefits to workers, while proponents argue that such laws ensure fair compensation.

:p The U.S. labor market is highly competitive, so state and federal laws that require overtime pay are unnecessary and should be abolished. Terms and Concepts: authorization card, cease-and-desist order, closed shop, collective bargaining, employment at will, hot-cargo agreements, I-9 verifications, I-551 Permanent Resident Card, lockout, minimum wage, right-to-work laws, secondary boycott, strike, union shop, vesting, whistleblowing, workers’ compensation laws, wrongful discharge.
??x
The statement that state and federal laws requiring overtime pay are unnecessary in a highly competitive labor market overlooks the protections these laws provide. Overtime laws ensure fair treatment of employees by guaranteeing additional pay for extra hours worked, thereby preventing exploitation. The terms provided (authorization card, cease-and-desist order, closed shop, collective bargaining, employment at will, hot-cargo agreements, I-9 verifications, I-551 Permanent Resident Card, lockout, minimum wage, right-to-work laws, secondary boycott, strike, union shop, vesting, whistleblowing, workers’ compensation laws, wrongful discharge) highlight various labor laws and practices that support the need for such protections. These terms collectively illustrate the complex nature of labor relations and the importance of maintaining fair working conditions.
??x

#### Title VII of the Civil Rights Act Overview
Background context: The Civil Rights Act, particularly Title VII, is a significant piece of legislation aimed at prohibiting employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, and gender. It was part of the broader civil rights movement that sought to end racial and other forms of discrimination in various aspects of American society.

:p What are the key provisions of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act?
??x
Title VII prohibits job discrimination against employees, applicants, and union members based on race, color, national origin, religion, and gender at any stage of employment. It bans discrimination in hiring, discipline procedures, discharge, promotion, and benefits. Additionally, it applies to employers with fifteen or more employees and certain labor unions, employment agencies, and state and local governing units or agencies.
x??

---

#### Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)
Background context: The EEOC is responsible for monitoring compliance with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. Employees who believe they have been discriminated against must file a claim with the EEOC before initiating legal action.

:p What role does the EEOC play in enforcing Title VII?
??x
The EEOC monitors compliance with Title VII and investigates disputes filed by employees alleging discrimination. It can conduct investigations and take enforcement actions to ensure that employers adhere to the non-discrimination policies mandated by the act.
x??

---

#### Legal Protections Against Discrimination
Background context: Various federal statutes provide protection against employment discrimination, including the Civil Rights Act's Title VII, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

:p What are some key federal laws that protect employees from discrimination?
??x
Key federal laws include:
- **Title VII of the Civil Rights Act**: Prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, and gender.
- **Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA)**: Protects individuals who are 40 years of age or older from employment discrimination based on age.
- **Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)**: Prevents employers from discriminating against qualified individuals with disabilities in job application procedures, hiring, advancement, compensation, and other terms and conditions of employment.

These laws also extend protections to U.S. citizens working abroad for American firms or those controlled by American firms.
x??

---

#### Specific Case Scenario
Background context: The text provides a hypothetical case involving Marta Brown, who faced discriminatory practices at her workplace after she married a Turkish man and began wearing a hijab and taking prayer breaks.

:p What issues does the scenario illustrate regarding employment discrimination?
??x
The scenario illustrates several instances of potential employment discrimination based on national origin (marriage to a Turkish man) and religious practices (wearing a hijab and taking prayer breaks). These actions by her employers could violate Title VII's prohibition against discrimination based on national origin and religion.

Key issues include:
- Forbidding the wearing of religious attire at work.
- Restricting prayer times outside designated lunch breaks, which may interfere with religious observance.
x??

---

---
#### Disparate-Impact Discrimination
Disparate-impact discrimination occurs when a protected group of people is adversely affected by an employer’s practices, procedures, or tests, even though they do not appear to be discriminatory. The plaintiff must first establish that these practices, procedures, or tests are effectively discriminatory.
:p What defines disparate-impact discrimination?
??x
Disparate-impact discrimination is identified when a protected group (such as nonwhites, women) faces adverse effects in the workplace due to certain employer practices or tests, without those practices appearing overtly biased. The plaintiff must demonstrate that these practices have a disproportionate negative impact on the protected groups.
x??

---
#### Prima Facie Case
Once the plaintiff has established that an employer’s practices or procedures are discriminatory, the burden of proof shifts to the employer to show that the practices or procedures in question were justified.
:p What is required after a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case?
??x
After establishing a prima facie case, the defendant (employer) must prove that their policies and procedures are necessary for legitimate business reasons. This involves showing that there was no other less discriminatory alternative available to achieve the same goal.
x??

---
#### Pool of Applicants
A plaintiff can prove a disparate impact by comparing the employer’s workforce to the pool of qualified individuals available in the local labor market. The plaintiff must show that as a result of educational or job requirements, the percentage of nonwhites, women, or members of other protected classes in the employer's workforce does not reflect the percentage of that group in the pool of qualified applicants.
:p How can a plaintiff prove disparate impact using the "Pool of Applicants" method?
??x
A plaintiff can prove disparate impact by comparing the demographics of their employer’s workforce to those of the local labor market. Specifically, if there is a significant underrepresentation of protected classes (e.g., nonwhites or women) in the employer's workforce relative to their availability in the pool of qualified applicants due to certain requirements or hiring procedures.
x??

---
#### Rate of Hiring
Another method for proving disparate impact discrimination involves comparing the selection rates of members and nonmembers of a protected class. If an educational or job requirement results in a substantially higher exclusion rate for a protected group, it can be considered discriminatory under EEOC guidelines.
:p How can a plaintiff prove disparate-impact discrimination using the "Rate of Hiring" method?
??x
A plaintiff can demonstrate disparate impact by comparing the hiring rates (selection rates) of different groups. Specifically, if members of a protected class are excluded from employment at a rate significantly higher than nonmembers, this may indicate discriminatory practices. According to EEOC guidelines, a selection rate for a protected class that is less than 80% (four-fifths) of the rate for the group with the highest hiring rate generally indicates disparate impact.
x??

---
#### Example - Shady Cove District Fire Department
Consider an example where a Shady Cove District Fire Department administers an exam to applicants. The selection rates for white and minority applicants can be compared to determine if there is evidence of discriminatory practices based on disparate-impact discrimination.
:p What does the given example illustrate?
??x
The example illustrates how the selection rate method can be used to identify potential disparate impact in hiring practices. In this case, the Shady Cove District Fire Department's exam had a significantly lower pass rate for minority applicants compared to white applicants, indicating possible discriminatory practices.

For instance:
- 50% of white applicants passed and were hired.
- Only 20% of minority applicants passed and were hired.

The difference in selection rates (20% vs. 50%) being less than four-fifths (80%) suggests that the test may be discriminatory under EEOC guidelines.
x??

---
#### Title VII Discrimination Based on Race, Color, and National Origin
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits employers from discriminating against employees or job applicants based on race, color, or national origin. Race is broadly interpreted to include ancestry or ethnic characteristics, while national origin encompasses discrimination due to birth in another country or cultural/ancestral background.
:p What does Title VII prohibit regarding race and national origin?
??x
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits employers from discriminating against employees or job applicants based on race, color, or national origin. This includes both direct discriminatory actions (e.g., refusing to hire someone because of their race) and indirect discriminatory practices (e.g., hiring policies that disproportionately affect certain racial groups). Race is interpreted broadly to cover ancestry and ethnic characteristics, while national origin covers discrimination due to a person's birth in another country or cultural/ancestral background.
x??

---

---
#### District Court and Federal Appellate Court Rulings
Background context: The district court initially accepted evidence that Montana had satisfied its burden to prove a history of discrimination, justifying preferences given to DBEs (Disadvantaged Businesses). However, a federal appellate court reversed this decision, ruling that the evidence was insufficient to support such claims.
:p What was the decision made by the federal appellate court regarding the district court's ruling?
??x
The federal appellate court reversed the district court’s decision because it found that the evidence presented by Montana was insufficient to prove a history of discrimination justifying preferences for DBEs. This means that while the district court accepted the evidence, the higher court disagreed and overturned this acceptance.
x??
---
#### Potential Section 1981 Claims
Background context: Section 1981 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 prohibits racial or ethnic discrimination in the formation or enforcement of contracts. This can be an alternative basis for a plaintiff’s action, especially if employment is involved, and allows for potentially higher damages than Title VII.
:p How does Section 1981 differ from Title VII in terms of potential damages?
??x
Section 1981 does not have the same damage caps as Title VII. Specifically, while there are no limits on the amount of damages that can be awarded under Section 1981, there are some caps on damages under Title VII.
x??
---
#### Religion Discrimination Under Title VII
Background context: Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination based on religion by government employers, private employers, and unions. This includes not only direct discrimination but also requiring or forbidding religious activities in the workplace.
:p What does Title VII protect against regarding religion in the workplace?
??x
Title VII protects against both direct and indirect forms of religious discrimination in the workplace. It prohibits treating employees more or less favorably based on their religious beliefs, as well as forcing them to participate in or abstain from religious activities.
x??
---
#### Example of Religious Discrimination
Background context: The example provided involves Jason Sewell, a salesperson who was fired after failing to attend weekly prayer meetings. If he can show that the dealership requires attendance and fires him for not attending, this would constitute discrimination based on his religion.
:p What is an example of religious discrimination in the workplace?
??x
An example of religious discrimination in the workplace is when Jason Sewell, a salesperson for JC Chevy, fails to attend weekly prayer meetings and is subsequently discharged. If he can prove that the dealership requires all employees to attend these meetings and fires him for not participating, this would be a valid claim of religious discrimination.
x??
---
#### Reasonable Accommodation
Background context: Employers are required to reasonably accommodate the religious practices and sincerely held beliefs of their employees unless it causes undue hardship. This can include accommodating days off due to religious observances or other job-related accommodations without permanent changes.
:p What is meant by "reasonable accommodation" in the workplace?
??x
Reasonable accommodation means that employers must make adjustments for employees’ religious practices and sincerely held beliefs, unless such adjustments would cause an undue hardship on the business. This can include providing days off for religious observances or making other job-related adjustments without requiring permanent changes.
x??
---
#### Case in Point: Religious Discrimination
Background context: Leontine Robinson was terminated from her administrative assistant position after refusing to get the flu vaccine based on her religious beliefs. She filed a lawsuit alleging religious discrimination, highlighting the employer's requirement for all employees in patient-care areas to receive the flu vaccine.
:p What is an example of religious discrimination that led to termination?
??x
An example of religious discrimination leading to termination involves Leontine Robinson, who was fired from her administrative assistant position at Children’s Hospital Boston after refusing to get the flu vaccine based on her religious beliefs. The hospital required all employees in patient-care areas to receive this vaccine, and when Robinson refused, she was terminated.
x??

#### Social Media and Hiring Discrimination Experiment

Background context: Two researchers from Carnegie-Mellon University conducted an experiment to determine whether social media information posted by prospective employees influences employers' hiring decisions.

:p What was the purpose of the study conducted by the two researchers at Carnegie-Mellon University?
??x
The purpose of the study was to investigate if social media profiles could influence hiring decisions and specifically, whether there is discrimination against candidates based on their religious affiliations. The experiment involved creating fake resumes and social media profiles, submitting job applications, and comparing responses from different groups of employers.
x??

---

#### Hiring Discrimination Results

Background context: The researchers created false résumés and social media profiles for prospective employees and submitted job applications to about four thousand U.S. employers. They compared the responses to different groups based on religious affiliations.

:p What were the findings of the experiment regarding candidates whose public profiles indicated that they were Muslim?
??x
The findings showed that candidates whose public profiles suggested they were Muslim were less likely to be called for interviews than Christian applicants. The difference was particularly pronounced in more conservative regions, where Muslims received callbacks only 2 percent of the time compared with 17 percent for Christian applicants.
x??

---

#### Impact on Job Candidates

Background context: The experiment revealed that job candidates frequently view the hiring process as unfair when their social media profiles are used during the selection process. This perception can lead to an increased likelihood of litigation.

:p How do job candidates typically perceive the use of their social media information in the hiring process?
??x
Job candidates often feel that the use of their social media information in the hiring process is unfair, which can result in a higher probability of legal action or litigation.
x??

---

#### Employer Practices

Background context: According to the study, 84% of employers report using social media in recruiting job applicants. One-third of these admit to disqualifying applicants based on content found in their social media accounts.

:p What percentage of employers use social media in their recruitment process?
??x
According to the study, 84% of employers use social media as part of their recruitment process.
x??

---

#### EEOC's Role

Background context: The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) is investigating how prospective employers can use social media to engage in discrimination. Given that more than three-fourths of its members use social media for employment screening, the EEOC aims to regulate this practice.

:p What action has the EEOC taken regarding the use of social media in hiring?
??x
The EEOC is investigating how prospective employers can use social media to engage in discrimination during the hiring process. They are also interested in regulating the procedure given that most human resource professionals (80%) use social media for employment screening.
x??

---

#### Legal Considerations

Background context: Social media sites may provide information on an applicant’s race, color, national origin, disability, religion, and other protected characteristics. Employers must not use such information to make employment decisions based on prohibited bases like race, gender, or religion.
