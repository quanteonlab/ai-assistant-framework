#### Compensatory Damages: Overview
Compensatory damages are awarded to a plaintiff who has suffered actual losses due to another party's wrongful act. The primary goal is to restore the plaintiff to their original position, often through monetary compensation for both quantifiable and non-quantifiable losses.

Special damages compensate for quantifiable monetary losses such as medical expenses and lost wages. General damages cover non-monetary aspects like pain and suffering.
:p What are compensatory damages used for?
??x
Compensatory damages are used to reimburse a plaintiff for actual losses resulting from another party's wrongful act, aiming to place the plaintiff in the same position they would have been in had the tort not occurred. They include both quantifiable monetary losses (special damages) and non-monetary aspects like pain and suffering (general damages).
x??

---

#### Special Damages: Examples
Special damages are awarded for specific, measurable financial losses suffered by a plaintiff due to a defendant's wrongful act. These typically include medical expenses, lost wages, and future benefits.
:p What types of damages fall under special damages?
??x
Special damages encompass quantifiable monetary losses such as medical expenses, lost wages, and future benefits that can be precisely measured in monetary terms.
x??

---

#### General Damages: Examples
General damages are awarded to compensate for non-monetary aspects of harm suffered by a plaintiff. These include pain and suffering, loss of companionship, and loss of consortium.
:p What does general damages cover?
??x
General damages cover intangible, non-monetary losses such as physical or emotional pain and suffering, loss of companionship, and loss of consortium, which are difficult to quantify in monetary terms but can be compensated through legal means.

#### Tort Law: Basic Concepts
Tort law is designed to compensate those who have suffered a loss or injury due to another person's wrongful act. It focuses on two main notions: wrongs and compensation.

Plaintiffs bring lawsuits against defendants in tort actions to obtain monetary damages or other relief for the harm suffered.
:p What are the primary goals of tort law?
??x
The primary goals of tort law are to provide remedies for violations of various protected interests, such as personal physical safety and property protection. Tort law aims to make victims whole by compensating them for both quantifiable (special damages) and non-quantifiable (general damages) losses.
x??

---

#### Damages Available in Tort Actions
Plaintiffs seek various types of compensation in tort actions, including monetary damages.

Legal usage distinguishes between "damage" (the harm or injury itself) and "damages" (monetary compensation for that harm).
:p What is the difference between "damage" and "damages"?
??x
"Damage" refers to the harm or injury suffered by a person or property. In contrast, "damages" are the monetary compensation awarded for such harm or injury.
x??

---

#### Tort Law: Purpose and Scope
Tort law provides remedies for various types of wrongful acts that cause physical injuries or interfere with personal security and freedom of movement.

It also addresses acts causing damage to property.
:p What is the general purpose of tort law?
??x
The general purpose of tort law is to provide remedies for violations of protected interests, such as personal physical safety and property protection. Tort law ensures that individuals can seek compensation when they are harmed due to another party's wrongful act.
x??

---

#### Business Risks in Tort Law
Businesses face a significant risk of being involved in lawsuits related to various circumstances.

Examples include customers suing for injuries caused by security guards or retail stores being sued for negligence.
:p What types of business risks can arise from tort law?
??x
Businesses can be at risk of lawsuits arising from various scenarios, such as customers suing for injuries caused by security guards (intentionally wrongful conduct) or customers slipping and falling in a retail store due to negligent actions.
x??

#### Assault vs. Battery

Background context: Tort law aims to protect individuals from harmful or offensive contact, including situations where there is no actual physical touch but a reasonable apprehension of imminent harm exists. An assault occurs when a defendant's conduct creates a reasonable apprehension of imminent harm in the plaintiff.

Explanation: The key difference between an assault and a battery lies in whether there has been actual contact with the plaintiff. If there is contact, it constitutes a battery, which requires the act to be harmful or offensive. However, if no physical touch occurs but the plaintiff reasonably fears harm, then an assault has occurred.

:p Can you differentiate between an assault and a battery?
??x
An assault occurs when a defendant's conduct creates a reasonable apprehension of imminent harm in the plaintiff, without actual contact. A battery is completed when there is harmful or offensive physical contact that results from the creation of this apprehension.
x??

---

#### Example of Assault and Battery

Background context: The example provided illustrates how an assault can precede a battery. Ivan's threat to shoot Jean with a gun creates an assault, while firing the gun (if it hits Jean) constitutes a battery.

:p Explain what happens in the scenario where Ivan threatens Jean with a gun.
??x
Ivan points a gun at Jean and threatens to shoot her. This action alone is considered an assault because it creates a reasonable apprehension of imminent harm without any actual contact. If Ivan then fires the gun and hits Jean, the act becomes a battery as it involves harmful physical contact resulting from the earlier threat.
x??

---

#### Physical Contact in Battery

Background context: Battery can involve any part of the body or anything attached to it, such as hats, purses, or jackets. The key element is that there must be offensive or harmful contact.

:p Can you describe what constitutes a battery?
??x
A battery occurs when there is an intentional and offensive or harmful physical contact with another person. This contact can involve any part of the body or anything attached to it, such as clothing items. The act must be intentional and cause harm or offense.
x??

---

#### Self-Defense in Battery

Background context: A defendant may use self-defense or defend others when their conduct results in a battery. The justification is that they were acting to protect themselves or someone else from harm.

:p How can a defendant justify their actions leading to a battery?
??x
A defendant can assert self-defense or defense of others as a justification for their conduct. This means the defendant was acting to prevent imminent harm to themselves or another person, thus protecting them from offensive or harmful contact.
x??

---

#### False Imprisonment

Background context: False imprisonment is the intentional confinement or restraint of another person's activities without justification. It interferes with the freedom to move without restraint and can be achieved through physical barriers, physical restraint, or threats.

:p What is false imprisonment?
??x
False imprisonment involves intentionally confining or restraining another person’s activities without a legal basis. This interference with movement can be done through physical barriers, physical restraints, or threats of force.
x??

---

#### Example of False Imprisonment

Background context: The example provided illustrates how businesses might face lawsuits for false imprisonment when they detain individuals suspected of shoplifting.

:p Explain the case involving Justin Mills at the Maryland Live Casino.
??x
Justin Mills was playing blackjack at a casino when two employees approached him, grabbed his arm, and led him into a back hallway. This action can be considered false imprisonment because it involved the intentional restraint of Mills' freedom to move without justification. The casino's conduct could potentially lead to legal consequences if it is deemed unreasonable.
x??

---

#### Reasonable Person Standard

Background context: The reasonable person standard is an "objective" test used in tort law, determining how a typical or average person would have acted under the same circumstances.

:p What is the reasonable person standard?
??x
The reasonable person standard is an objective test used to determine whether someone's actions were reasonable under the circumstances. It assesses what a hypothetical "reasonable person" would have done in similar situations.
x??

---

#### Parody and First Amendment Protection
Background context: The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that parodies of public figures are protected under the First Amendment, specifically addressing intentional infliction of emotional distress claims. This protection is similar to standards applied in defamation lawsuits for public figures.

:p What did the Supreme Court's ruling in Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell establish regarding parodies of public figures?
??x
The ruling established that parodies of public figures are protected under the First Amendment, providing a defense against intentional infliction of emotional distress claims. This protection aligns with defamation standards for public figures.
x??

---

#### Defamation Law Overview
Background context: The First Amendment does not provide absolute freedom of speech; courts must balance free speech against other societal interests, such as preventing attacks on reputation. Defamation involves wrongful harm to a person's good reputation and can take the form of libel (written) or slander (oral).

:p What are the four main elements required to establish defamation according to this text?
??x
The four elements of establishing defamation are:
1. The defendant made a false statement of fact.
2. The statement was understood as being about the plaintiff and tended to harm the plaintiff’s reputation.
3. The statement was published to at least one person other than the plaintiff.
4. If the plaintiff is a public figure, they must also prove actual malice.

x??

---

#### Application of Defamation Law in Online Reviews
Background context: In this scenario, an attorney faced defamation claims from clients who posted negative reviews online about their professional services. The case highlights how defamation law applies to digital platforms and involves proving the elements of defamation as outlined earlier.

:p What type of statement by Blake and Birzon would likely constitute libel under defamation law?
??x
The statements made by Blake and Birzon, such as "She was combative and explosive," "she misrepresented her fees with regards to the contract I initially signed," would likely constitute libel since they are written statements that harmed the attorney's reputation.

x??

---

#### Public Figures and Actual Malice
Background context: For public figures to succeed in a defamation lawsuit, they must prove actual malice, which means the defendant published the false statement with knowledge of its falsity or reckless disregard for the truth. This standard is higher than for private individuals.

:p In a defamation case involving a public figure, what additional element must be proven besides the four main elements?
??x
In a defamation case involving a public figure, in addition to proving the four main elements, the plaintiff must also prove actual malice, meaning that the defendant published the false statement with knowledge of its falsity or with reckless disregard for the truth.

x??

#### Example Case: Giustibelli v. Blake and Birzon
Background context: This case involves an attorney suing clients who posted defamatory reviews online about her services during a divorce proceeding. The case explores the application of defamation law to digital platforms and the challenges faced by public figures in proving their claims.

:p What was the nature of the statements made by Blake and Birzon that formed the basis of Giustibelli’s libel lawsuit?
??x
The statements made by Blake and Birzon, such as "She insisted I was an emotionally abused wife who couldn’t make rational decisions," were defamatory because they falsely suggested Giustibelli had acted improperly in the handling of the divorce case.

x??

---

#### Free Speech Protection under the First Amendment
Background context: The First Amendment of the United States Constitution protects freedom of speech, press, and assembly. Statements of opinion are generally protected from defamation claims due to this protection.

:p What is the standard for protecting free speech guaranteed by the First Amendment?
??x
The First Amendment typically protects statements of opinion as a form of free speech. However, factual allegations can undermine this defense if they are false and damaging.
x??

---

#### Application of Free Speech Protection to Online Reviews
Background context: In the provided case, Blake and Birzon argued that their internet reviews constituted opinions and thus were protected by the First Amendment. The court disagreed because the statements contained factual allegations that were proven to be false.

:p How did this standard apply to the statements posted online by Blake and Birzon?
??x
The court determined that even if the statement is phrased as an opinion, it can still be actionable if it contains false factual assertions. In this case, the reviews made specific, fact-based claims (about lying and falsifying contracts) that were proven to be false, thus not protected by free speech.
x??

---

#### Statement of Fact vs. Opinion in Defamation Cases
Background context: The key distinction is whether a statement conveys an objective fact or subjective opinion. Opinions are typically protected under the First Amendment, while factual statements can lead to defamation liability if they are false.

:p What differentiates a statement of fact from a statement of opinion?
??x
A statement of fact makes a claim that can be proven true or false, whereas a statement of opinion expresses a personal view. For example, "Lane cheats on his taxes" is factual and potentially defamatory, while "Lane is a jerk" is an opinion.
x??

---

#### Legal Requirement for Publication in Defamation
Background context: A defamatory statement must be published to the public or at least third parties other than the person being defamed. This can include written statements (letters), spoken words, and electronic communications.

:p What does "publication" mean in defamation cases?
??x
Publication means that the defamatory statement was communicated to someone other than the victim. This can be through writing a letter, speaking directly or indirectly to others, or via the internet.
x??

---

#### Example of Defamation Through Electronic Communication
Background context: The case mentions that statements made online (via the Internet) are actionable as defamation.

:p Can defamatory statements made via the internet be considered publication?
??x
Yes, defamatory statements posted on the internet can constitute publication. Even if only a third party overhears or reads the statement by chance, it still counts as public communication.
x??

---

#### Third Party Republishing of Defamatory Statements
Background context: If someone repeats or republishes a defamatory statement without revealing the source, they can be held liable for defamation.

:p What is the legal consequence if an individual repeats or republishes a defamatory statement?
??x
An individual who repeats or republishes defamatory statements can be held liable for defamation, even if they do not reveal the source of the information. This means that the repetition of false and damaging claims by others can still result in legal consequences.
x??

#### Qualified Privilege and Jorge's Memo
Background context: In this scenario, Jorge is being considered for a management position at Google. His supervisor, Lydia, writes a memo about his performance that contains certain negative statements. These statements are honestly believed to be true by Lydia.

Explanation: Generally, privileged communications can protect individuals from defamation claims. Qualified privilege applies in situations where the information is relevant and necessary, but it depends on whether the disclosure was made for a proper purpose and without malice. If Lydia limits her memo's disclosure to company representatives, it may be protected under qualified privilege.

:p In what situation might Lydia’s memo about Jorge be protected by a qualified privilege?
??x
Lydia’s memo could be protected by a qualified privilege if:
1. The statements are relevant and necessary for the purposes of evaluating Jorge for a management position.
2. The disclosure is made to those who have a legitimate interest in knowing such information, like members of the evaluation committee.
3. Lydia honestly believes that her statements are true.

The protection under qualified privilege depends on whether the memo's content serves a proper purpose and was not made with malice or ill intent.

#### Public Figures and Actual Malice
Background context: This section discusses public figures, who are individuals like politicians, entertainers, professional athletes, etc., who are considered "fair game" for media scrutiny. For statements about public figures to be defamatory, the speaker must have acted with actual malice—knowledge of falsity or a reckless disregard of the truth.

Explanation: Public figures have a higher burden of proof in defamation cases because they voluntarily place themselves in the public eye and accept the risk that their actions will be scrutinized by the media. However, this does not mean that any false statement made about them is automatically defamatory; it must also be shown that the speaker acted with actual malice.

:p What standard must a public figure meet to prove defamation?
??x
To prove defamation in cases involving public figures, they must show that the statements were made with actual malice. This means the statement must have been made with either:
1. Knowledge of its falsity.
2. Reckless disregard for the truth.

This standard is higher than for private individuals and reflects the idea that public figures have voluntarily placed themselves in a position where they are subject to greater scrutiny.

#### Case Study: David Beckham's Libel Suit
Background context: This case involves In Touch Weekly magazine publishing a story about a former call girl claiming to have slept with legendary soccer player David Beckham. Beckham sued for libel, but the lawsuit was ultimately dismissed due to lack of evidence proving actual malice.

Explanation: The New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964) established that public figures must prove actual malice to succeed in a defamation case. In this instance, although the statements were potentially false, there was no proof that the magazine had acted with actual malice—either knowingly false or reckless disregard for the truth.

:p Why was David Beckham's libel lawsuit against In Touch Weekly dismissed?
??x
David Beckham’s libel lawsuit was dismissed because he could not show that In Touch Weekly acted with actual malice. Specifically, there was no evidence proving that:
1. The statements were made with knowledge of their falsity.
2. There was a reckless disregard for the truth.

The burden of proof required to establish defamation against public figures is higher due to their voluntary exposure to media scrutiny and acceptance of criticism.

#### Invasion of Privacy
Background context: This concept covers a person's right to privacy, which can be protected through various legal means including constitutional amendments, state laws, and tort law. An invasion of privacy occurs when there is an intrusion into someone’s private life without their consent.

Explanation: Four key acts qualify as invasions of privacy under the common law:
1. Intrusion upon seclusion
2. Public disclosure of private facts
3. False light in fact
4. Appropriation of one's name or likeness

These acts are highly offensive and require a person to have a reasonable expectation of privacy.

:p What are the four acts that qualify as invasions of privacy under common law?
??x
The four acts that qualify as invasions of privacy under common law are:
1. Intrusion upon seclusion: Unlawful entry onto private property or into one's personal space.
2. Public disclosure of private facts: Publishing highly offensive private information about an individual to the public without their consent.
3. False light in fact: Misrepresenting someone’s image in a false and offensive manner, often through statements or photographs.
4. Appropriation of one's name or likeness: Using another person's name or likeness for commercial gain without permission.

Each act involves an intrusion into private life that is highly offensive to the individual.

#### Invasion of Privacy and Legal Claims
Background context: Victims of revenge porn often sue their perpetrators in civil courts based on various legal claims. These include invasion of privacy, public disclosure of private facts, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.

Example case: Nadia Hussain sued Akhil Patel for these claims after he subjected her to years of harassment and posted secretly recorded sexual videos online without her consent.
:p What are the main legal claims that victims use when suing perpetrators in civil court?
??x
Victims sue on three primary legal grounds:
1. **Invasion of Privacy**: This claim is based on the unauthorized use or dissemination of personal information or private activities, which intrudes upon a plaintiff's reasonable expectation of privacy.
2. **Public Disclosure of Private Facts**: This involves sharing private facts about the victim that are not of legitimate concern to the public and cause significant emotional distress.
3. **Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED)**: This claim is made when the defendant's conduct is extreme and outrageous, causing severe mental or emotional suffering.

For example, in Nadia Hussain’s case, Patel violated her privacy by hacking into her accounts and posting sexual videos online without consent.
x??

---

#### Revenge Porn with Detailed Information
Background context: Revenge porn can take many forms. However, one of the most severe cases involves perpetrators not only sharing explicit content but also providing detailed personal information about their victims.

Example case: The Senate Armed Services Committee held hearings on a private Facebook group called Marines United that circulated nude photos of women (including fellow marines) without their consent.
:p What is an example of revenge porn involving detailed personal information?
??x
An example is the Marine United incident, where nude photos of female service members were shared in a closed Facebook group. The detailed personal information included names, addresses, and other identifying details.
x??

---

#### Appropriate Use of Identity
Background context: Privacy also includes the right to use one's identity without commercial exploitation. Using someone’s name, picture, likeness, or other identifiable characteristics for commercial purposes without permission is considered an invasion of privacy.

Example scenario: An advertising agency approached a singer with a distinctive voice and stage presence to participate in a marketing campaign for a new automobile.
:p What does the appropriate use of identity mean?
??x
The appropriate use of identity means that an individual’s name, picture, likeness, or other identifiable characteristics should not be used commercially without their permission. This ensures that individuals retain control over how their identity is utilized.

For instance, if an advertising agency wants to feature a singer in their campaign, they must obtain the singer's consent before using any of their identifying features.
x??

---

#### Appellate Court Decision
Background context: In the case of Nadia Hussain vs. Akhil Patel, the appellate court reduced the damages awarded for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) because the evidence did not fully support this claim.

Example decision: The jury initially awarded $500,000 but the appellate court reduced it to$345,000.
:p Why might an appellate court reduce a damage award?
??x
An appellate court may reduce a damage award if it determines that the evidence supporting the claim is not sufficiently strong or if there are other legal reasons such as proportionality of damages.

In Nadia Hussain's case, the appellate court reduced the award for intentional infliction of emotional distress because the evidence did not fully support this specific claim.
x??

---

#### Revenge Porn on Social Media
Background context: Revenge porn is often disseminated through social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Reddit. These sites have policies against pornography but users can hide content within restricted or closed groups.

Example scenario: The Marine United case involved the circulation of nude photos on a private Facebook group.
:p How do social media platforms handle revenge porn?
??x
Social media platforms typically have explicit policies against pornography. However, perpetrators may use hidden groups to share such content. For instance, in the Marine United case, once a user reported the group, it was closed down and at least one member faced legal consequences.

While Facebook and other companies take down reported content, users can often evade detection by hiding material within restricted or closed groups.
x??

---

#### Differentiating Concepts
Background context: Each of these concepts—revenge porn, invasion of privacy, public disclosure, emotional distress, and identity appropriation—covers different aspects of privacy infringement.

Example cases include:
- **Revenge porn**: Sharing explicit content without consent.
- **Invasion of Privacy**: Unauthorized use or dissemination of personal information.
- **Public Disclosure of Private Facts**: Revealing private facts not of public concern.
- **Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED)**: Extreme and outrageous conduct causing severe emotional distress.
- **Identity Appropriation**: Commercial use of someone's identity without permission.

Each concept addresses a different dimension of privacy invasion, making them distinct yet related claims in legal battles.
:p How do these concepts differ?
??x
These concepts differ as follows:
- **Revenge porn** involves sharing explicit sexual content without consent.
- **Invasion of Privacy** covers unauthorized use or dissemination of personal information.
- **Public Disclosure of Private Facts** pertains to revealing private facts not of public concern.
- **Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED)** involves extreme and outrageous conduct causing severe emotional distress.
- **Identity Appropriation** concerns commercial use of someone’s identity without permission.

Each claim addresses a specific aspect of privacy invasion, providing different legal grounds for plaintiffs in civil court cases.

#### Tort of Wrongful Interference with a Contractual Relationship
Background context: The tort of wrongful interference with a contractual relationship involves interfering with another party's contract without justification. This can include inducing someone to breach their contract or interfering with business relationships.
If applicable, add code examples with explanations:
```java
public class ContractInterferenceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example scenario: Gye enticing Wagner to break the contract with Lumley
        String gyeAction = "enticed Wagner to refuse to carry out the agreement";
        if (gyeAction.equals("enticed Wagner to refuse to carry out the agreement")) {
            System.out.println("Gye's action constitutes a tort.");
        }
    }
}
```
:p What is the tort of wrongful interference with a contractual relationship?
??x
It is a legal wrong that occurs when someone intentionally interferes with another party’s contract, causing them harm. This can include inducing one party to breach their contract or interfering with a business relationship.
x??

---

#### Tort of Wrongful Interference with a Business Relationship
Background context: The tort of wrongful interference with a business relationship involves interfering with an established business relationship without justification. It is similar to the tort of wrongful interference with a contractual relationship but specifically targets business relationships rather than just contracts.
If applicable, add code examples with explanations:
```java
public class BusinessInterferenceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example scenario: Joe's trying to attract customers from Ultimate Sport
        String action = "Joe’s cannot station an employee at the entrance of Ultimate Sport’s";
        if (action.equals("Joe’s cannot station an employee at the entrance of Ultimate Sport’s")) {
            System.out.println("This type of activity constitutes the tort of wrongful interference with a business relationship.");
        }
    }
}
```
:p What is the tort of wrongful interference with a business relationship?
??x
It involves interfering with another's business relationship without justification, such as luring away key employees or customers. This can lead to legal action if proven that the interference was intentional and caused harm.
x??

---

#### Defenses to Wrongful Interference
Background context: A person will not be liable for wrongful interference if the interference is justified or permissible. Permissible defenses include bona fide competitive behavior such as marketing and advertising strategies, even if they result in breaking a contract.
If applicable, add code examples with explanations:
```java
public class DefensesExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example scenario: Taylor Meats inducing Sam’s Restaurant to break its contract
        String action = "Taylor Meats advertises so effectively that it induces Sam’s Restaurant to break its contract";
        if (action.equals("Taylor Meats advertises so effectively that it induces Sam’s Restaurant to break its contract")) {
            System.out.println("Burke's Meat Company will be unable to recover against Taylor Meats on a wrongful interference theory.");
        }
    }
}
```
:p What are the defenses to wrongful interference?
??x
Defenses to wrongful interference include showing that the interference was justified or permissible, such as engaging in competitive practices like marketing and advertising. These activities are generally considered acceptable even if they result in breaking a contract.
x??

#### Example 6.18 - Wrongful Interference with Business Relationship
Background context: This example illustrates how attempting to attract customers by interfering with another business's operations can constitute wrongful interference.
If applicable, add code examples with explanations:
```java
public class WrongfulInterferenceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example scenario: Joe’s trying to attract customers from Ultimate Sport
        String action = "Joe’s cannot station an employee at the entrance of Ultimate Sport’s";
        if (action.equals("Joe’s cannot station an employee at the entrance of Ultimate Sport’s")) {
            System.out.println("This constitutes the tort of wrongful interference with a business relationship.");
        }
    }
}
```
:p What does this example illustrate?
??x
It illustrates that attempting to attract customers by placing employees in another store's premises to divert customers is considered wrongful interference and can be seen as an unfair trade practice.
x??

---

#### Example 6.19 - Defenses Against Wrongful Interference
Background context: This example demonstrates how effective marketing strategies, even if they lead to breaking a contract, are not necessarily actionable as wrongful interference due to public policy favoring free competition.
If applicable, add code examples with explanations:
```java
public class DefenseExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example scenario: Taylor Meats inducing Sam’s Restaurant to break its contract
        String action = "Taylor Meats advertises so effectively that it induces Sam’s Restaurant to break its contract";
        if (action.equals("Taylor Meats advertises so effectively that it induces Sam’s Restaurant to break its contract")) {
            System.out.println("Burke's Meat Company will be unable to recover against Taylor Meats on a wrongful interference theory.");
        }
    }
}
```
:p What does this example illustrate?
??x
It illustrates that Burke’s Meat Company cannot recover damages from Taylor Meats for inducing Sam’s Restaurant to break its contract, as the effective advertising by Taylor Meats is considered acceptable under public policy favoring free competition.
x??

#### Conversion
Background context: Conversion occurs when a person wrongfully deprives another of the use or benefit of their property without legal authority. This can happen through various means, such as unauthorized use of credit cards.

C/Java code or pseudocode is not directly applicable here, but we can provide an example to illustrate the concept:
```java
public class ConversionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Simulate Welco Electronics using a credit card without permission
        CreditCard welcoCreditCard = new CreditCard("Welco", "1234567890");
        Employee employeeMora = new Employee("Nicholas Mora");
        
        // Unauthorized use of the credit card by Mora
        Mora.useCreditCard(welcoCreditCard);
        
        // Depositing money into AQM's account and transferring to personal account
        Account aqmAccount = new Account("AQM Supplies", 0);
        Account personalAccount = new Account("Personal Account", 0);
        
        aqmAccount.depositMoney(375000); // $375,000
        aqmAccount.transferFundsTo(personalAccount);
    }
    
    static class CreditCard {
        String name;
        String cardNumber;
        
        public CreditCard(String name, String cardNumber) {
            this.name = name;
            this.cardNumber = cardNumber;
        }
    }
    
    static class Employee {
        String name;
        
        public Employee(String name) {
            this.name = name;
        }
        
        void useCreditCard(CreditCard creditCard) {
            System.out.println(name + " used the credit card without permission.");
        }
    }
    
    static class Account {
        String ownerName;
        double balance;
        
        public Account(String ownerName, double initialBalance) {
            this.ownerName = ownerName;
