**Starting Chapter:** 34-2 Wages Hours and Layoffs

---

#### Davis-Bacon Act
Background context: The Davis-Bacon Act, codified under 40 U.S.C. Sections 276a–276a-5, requires contractors and subcontractors working on federal government construction projects to pay “prevailing wages” to their employees. These prevailing wages are determined based on the average wage rates for similar workers in the local area.

:p What does the Davis-Bacon Act require?
??x
The Davis-Bacon Act mandates that contractors and sub-contractors working on federal construction projects must pay "prevailing wages" as determined by local average wage rates.

#### Walsh-Healey Act
Background context: The Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act, codified under 41 U.S.C. Sections 35–45, applies to contracts with the U.S. government. It mandates that contractors and subcontractors must pay a minimum wage and provide overtime pay at 1.5 times the regular rate for hours worked over 40 in a workweek.

:p What does the Walsh-Healey Act require?
??x
The Walsh-Healey Act requires that employees of manufacturers or suppliers entering into contracts with U.S. government agencies receive a minimum wage and be compensated for overtime at 1.5 times their regular rate.

#### Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)
Background context: The Fair Labor Standards Act, codified under 29 U.S.C. Sections 201–260, is the most comprehensive federal regulation of wages and hours today. It extends wage-hour requirements to all employers engaged in interstate commerce or producing goods for interstate commerce. The act covers various aspects such as minimum wage, overtime pay, child labor, and recordkeeping.

:p What does the FLSA cover?
??x
The FLSA covers a broad range of employment practices including minimum wage, overtime pay, child labor, and recordkeeping requirements.
x??

---

#### Child Labor Restrictions
Background context: The FLSA prohibits oppressive child labor. The restrictions vary by age group:
- Children under 14 are limited to only certain types of work.
- Ages 14 and 15 can work but not in hazardous occupations.
- Ages 16 and 17 have fewer restrictions than younger workers, but they cannot be employed in hazardous jobs.

:p What does the FLSA restrict regarding child labor?
??x
The FLSA restricts child labor by limiting the types of work and hours children can perform based on their age. Children under 14 are limited to non-hazardous work; those aged 14-15 have fewer restrictions but cannot engage in hazardous occupations.
x??

---

#### Minimum Wages
Background context: The FLSA mandates that a minimum wage must be paid to covered, nonexempt employees. Most states also have their own minimum wage laws. When state and federal minimum wages differ, the higher of the two applies.

:p What does the FLSA provide regarding minimum wages?
??x
The FLSA requires employers to pay at least the federal minimum wage to covered, nonexempt employees. Additionally, many states have established their own minimum wages, with more than half setting them above the federal rate.
x??

---

#### Tipped Workers
Background context: The FLSA allows for a tip credit toward the minimum wage amount when an employee receives tips while working. Employers are required to pay at least $2.13 per hour in direct wages, provided that the total (wages + tips) equals or exceeds the federal minimum wage. In some states, employers cannot include tips as part of the minimum wage.

:p What is the FLSA’s rule for tipped workers?
??x
The FLSA allows employers to credit up to $2.13 per hour toward the federal minimum wage if an employee receives tips and if their total earnings (wages + tips) meet or exceed the minimum wage. In some states, this tip credit is not allowed.
x??

#### Interaction of State and Federal Wage and Overtime Laws
State legislation may include rules that impact federal wage and overtime laws. For example, if a state requires employers to give employees one day off per week, an employee who works that day may be entitled to overtime wages.

:p How can state laws interact with federal wage and overtime laws?
??x
State laws can sometimes provide more stringent requirements than federal law. In the case of wage and overtime laws, states might require a day off or other benefits that exceed what is mandated by federal law, thereby affecting whether an employee qualifies for overtime pay.

For instance, if California state law requires employees to receive one day off per week, working on that day could entitle the employee to overtime wages according to both state and potentially federal laws.
x??

#### Case in Point 34.6
The case of Mendoza v. Nordstrom, Inc., involved two employees who were required to work more than six consecutive days without receiving a day off. California’s labor law prohibits employers from causing employees “to work more than six days in seven.”

:p What was the legal dispute in the Mendoza v. Nordstrom case?
??x
The legal dispute centered around whether the prohibition on working more than six days in seven should be measured on a rolling basis or on a calendar basis. Nordstrom argued that an average of one day off per week (rolling basis) would comply with California's law, while the employees claimed that they were entitled to a day off each workweek.

The state’s highest court ruled that employees are entitled to one day off each workweek, not just over a seven-day rolling period. Thus, working more than six consecutive days without a day off violates California’s labor law.

#### Layoffs and the WARN Act
The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act applies to employers with at least 100 full-time employees and requires these employers to provide sixty days’ notice before implementing a mass layoff or closing a plant that employs more than fifty full-time workers. A mass layoff is defined as laying off at least one-third of the full-time employees at a particular job site.

:p What are the key requirements of the WARN Act?
??x
The key requirements of the WARN Act include:
- Employers with 100 or more full-time employees must provide 60 days’ notice before implementing a mass layoff or closing a plant that employs more than fifty full-time workers.
- A mass layoff is defined as laying off at least one-third of the full-time employees at a particular job site.
- Employers are required to notify both affected workers and state and local government authorities. They may also need to inform the union representative if workers are members of a labor union.

Violators can be fined up to $500 per day, and employees can recover back pay (up to 60 days) plus reasonable attorneys' fees.

#### Family and Medical Leave
The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) allows employees to take time off work for family or medical reasons or in certain situations that arise from military service. Many states have similar legislation.

:p What does the FMLA allow employees to do?
??x
The FMLA provides eligible employees with up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave each year for:
- Birth and care of a new child,
- Adoption or foster care placement of a child,
- To care for a spouse, son, daughter, or parent who has a serious health condition,
- To deal with their own serious health condition that makes them unable to perform the essential functions of their job.

The act also requires employers to maintain employees' group health insurance coverage during the leave period and return them to their original jobs or equivalent ones upon their return.

#### Job Reinstatement and Other Remedies
Background context: In employment law, a successful plaintiff is entitled to various remedies when an employer violates their rights. These include job reinstatement, promotion (if denied), and other forms of compensation.

:p What are the main remedial actions that a successful plaintiff can seek in cases where an employer has violated their rights?
??x
The main remedial actions include:
- Job reinstatement: The employee is restored to their previous position.
- Promotion: If a promotion was denied, the plaintiff can receive this as part of the remedy.
- Court costs and attorney's fees: These are reimbursed by the employer to the successful plaintiff.

In cases where the employer acted in bad faith, the plaintiff may also be awarded twice the amount of damages. Supervisors can be held personally liable for violations of the act if they participated or were involved.

Additionally, employers must notify employees when an absence will count against their Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) leave. Failure to provide such notice can result in sanctions by the employer.

#### Workers' Compensation and Related Statutes
Background context: Historically, employees injured on the job had to sue their employers for recovery. Today, numerous state and federal statutes protect employees from accidental injuries, death, or diseases due to employment.

:p How do current laws address workplace injuries compared to historical practices?
??x
Historically, employees who were injured on the job had to file lawsuits against their employers to obtain recovery. However, today, various state and federal statutes provide protections for employees, including:

- Workers' Compensation: This provides financial assistance to workers who are injured or become ill due to their employment.
- Other protective laws: These include measures that ensure income security through Social Security, Medicare, unemployment insurance, and the regulation of pensions and health insurance plans.

These laws have significantly reduced the need for individual lawsuits while ensuring that employees receive necessary support.

#### Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA)
Background context: The Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) is a federal law designed to protect workers' health and safety. It imposes duties on employers to maintain safe working conditions, requiring them to follow specific safety standards based on the industry.

:p What are the key components of OSHA?
??x
The key components of OSHA include:
- General duty clause: Employers must keep their workplaces free from recognized hazards that could cause death or serious physical harm.
- Industry-specific safety standards: These establish specific requirements for various industries, such as the use of safety guards on machinery.

OSHA regulations require employers to comply with these standards to ensure a safe working environment. For example, OSHA mandates the use of safety guards on certain mechanical equipment and sets maximum levels of exposure to harmful substances in the workplace.

#### Case Study: James Bobo and TVA
Background context: This case involves an employee who contracted asbestos-related cancer and his wife who was subsequently diagnosed with malignant mesothelioma due to "take-home" asbestos. The lawsuit alleged negligence on the part of the employer, leading to a significant award.

:p What were the key findings in the James Bobo case?
??x
The key findings in the James Bobo case were:
- TVA knew about OSHA regulations adopted during his employment period that aimed to prevent exposure both at work and at home.
- The court found that TVA failed to follow these regulations, which allowed asbestos fibers to be brought off-site via employees' clothing.
- As a result, Barbara Bobo (James's wife) was exposed to harmful levels of asbestos while washing his clothes.

The court awarded $3.3 million in damages to the plaintiffs and remanded the case for recalculation due to potential issues with the initial damage assessment.

#### COBRA (Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act)
Background context: COBRA is a federal law that provides continuation of group health insurance coverage for employees and their dependents who are losing such coverage due to job loss, reduction in hours, or other qualifying events. This law ensures that individuals can continue their employer-sponsored health care plans after leaving employment.
The provisions of COBRA require employers to inform employees about the availability of this continuation coverage within a specified timeframe.

:p What is COBRA and what does it ensure?
??x
COBRA is a federal law ensuring that employees and their dependents can continue their employer-sponsored group health insurance plans after job loss, reduction in hours, or other qualifying events. It requires employers to inform workers about the continuation coverage options within 60 days of the event.
```java
// Pseudocode for COBRA Notification Process
public void notifyEmployeeOfCOBRADetails(Employee emp) {
    // Check if the employee is eligible for COBRA
    if (isEligibleForCOBRA(emp)) {
        // Inform the employee about COBRA options within 60 days
        informEmployeeAboutCOBRAOptions(emp);
    }
}
```

#### HIPAA and Employer-Sponsored Group Health Plans
Background context: The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) has provisions that affect employer-sponsored group health plans. It restricts how employers can collect, use, and disclose employee and family member health information.
Employers are required to designate privacy officials, distribute privacy notices, and train employees to ensure compliance.

:p What is HIPAA's role in employer-sponsored group health plans?
??x
HIPAA regulates the collection, use, and disclosure of health information by employers. It requires employers to designate privacy officers, distribute privacy notices, and train employees to protect employee health data from unauthorized disclosures.
```java
// Pseudocode for HIPAA Compliance Process
public void ensureHIPAACompliance() {
    // Designate a privacy officer
    PrivacyOfficer officer = new PrivacyOfficer();
    
    // Distribute privacy notices to employees
    distributePrivacyNoticesToEmployees(officer);
    
    // Train employees on data protection
    trainEmployeesOnDataProtection(officer);
}
```
x??

#### Affordable Care Act (ACA) and Employer Obligations
Background context: The ACA, often referred to as Obamacare, mandates that most employers with fifty or more full-time employees provide health-insurance benefits. Employers can receive tax credits for offering these plans and face fines if they do not comply.
The act also includes a provision known as the "50/30 rule," which imposes fines on employers who fail to offer coverage.

:p What does the Affordable Care Act require from employers?
??x
The Affordable Care Act requires most employers with fifty or more full-time employees to provide health-insurance benefits. Employers can receive tax credits for offering these plans and may face fines if they do not comply, especially under the "50/30 rule" where a fine of up to $2,000 per employee is imposed after the first thirty people.
```java
// Pseudocode for ACA Compliance Check
public boolean checkForACACompliance(Employee[] employees) {
    int fullTimeEmployees = countFullTimeEmployees(employees);
    
    if (fullTimeEmployees >= 50) {
        // Offer health insurance benefits or face fines
        if (!doesEmployerOfferHealthInsurance()) {
            return false; // Non-compliant employer
        } else {
            // Check for 50/30 rule compliance
            int fineableEmployees = fullTimeEmployees - 30;
            if (fineableEmployees > 0) {
                return doesEmployerOfferAffordableCoverage(fineableEmployees);
            }
            return true; // Compliant employer
        }
    } else {
        return true; // Small employers are not subject to this rule
    }
}
```

#### Employee Privacy Concerns and Electronic Monitoring
Background context: Employers have increasingly engaged in electronic monitoring of employees' activities, including reviewing emails, social media posts, video recordings, recording phone conversations, and listening to voice mail. These practices raise significant privacy concerns for employees.
The extent of these monitoring practices is a major issue in today's workplace.

:p What are the main privacy concerns related to employee electronic monitoring?
??x
The main privacy concerns relate to employers using invasive tactics such as monitoring emails, social media, video recordings, phone conversations, and voice mails. These practices can violate employees' personal and professional boundaries, leading to potential legal and ethical issues.
```java
// Pseudocode for Monitoring Practices Review
public void reviewMonitoringPractices() {
    // Check email reviews
    if (isEmailBeingMonitored()) {
        logActivity("Email monitoring is active.");
    }
    
    // Check social media posts and Internet messages
    if (isSocialMediaPostsOrInternetMessagesBeingMonitored()) {
        logActivity("Social media and internet monitoring is active.");
    }
    
    // Check video recordings, phone conversations, and voice mail listening
    if (isVideoRecordingsBeingMade() || 
        arePhoneConversationsBeingRecorded() ||
        areVoiceMailsBeingListenedTo()) {
        logActivity("Video recordings, phone conversations, and voice mails are monitored.");
    }
}
```

#### Polygraph Tests and Drug Testing

Background context: Federal, state, and local government employers, certain security service firms, and companies that manufacture and distribute controlled substances may conduct polygraph tests. Additionally, other employers may use these tests when investigating losses attributable to theft, including embezzlement and the theft of trade secrets. In terms of drug testing, many employers require their employees to submit to drug tests for public safety reasons or based on reasonable suspicion.

:p What are the circumstances under which federal, state, and local government employers can conduct polygraph tests?
??x
Federal, state, and local government employers can conduct polygraph tests in certain situations. These include:

- When investigating losses attributable to theft, including embezzlement.
- When investigating the theft of trade secrets.
- In some cases, for security screening purposes.

In addition, certain security service firms may also use these tests, as well as companies that manufacture and distribute controlled substances.

```java
// Example pseudocode for a hypothetical polygraph test scenario
public class PolygraphTest {
    public boolean conductTest(String employeeID) {
        // Conditions to determine if the test should be conducted
        if (isInvestigatingLosses(employeeID)) {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

    private boolean isInvestigatingLosses(String employeeID) {
        // Logic to check if there are losses attributable to theft or trade secrets
        // This would involve accessing the employee's record and determining if they have been implicated in any incidents.
        return false; // Placeholder for actual logic
    }
}
```

#### Drug Testing of Public Employers

Background context: The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures, which limits drug testing by public employers. However, certain employees working in positions that may threaten public safety are subject to drug testing when there is a reasonable basis for suspicion.

:p How does the Fourth Amendment affect drug testing of public employees?
??x
The Fourth Amendment restricts drug testing of public employees because it prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures. Public employers must ensure that their drug testing procedures do not violate this amendment. However, drug testing may be permissible under certain conditions:

- For transportation workers: Drug testing is allowed by statute.
- For employees in positions where drug use could threaten public safety: Courts typically uphold such tests as reasonable.

If there is a reasonable basis for suspecting an employee of drug use, courts usually find that the drug testing does not violate the Fourth Amendment.

```java
// Example pseudocode for determining if drug testing is permissible under the Fourth Amendment
public class DrugTestingPolicy {
    public boolean canTestEmployee(String jobTitle, String suspicionOfDrugUse) {
        // Check if the employee's job title qualifies them for drug testing based on safety concerns
        if (isHighRiskJob(jobTitle)) {
            return true;
        }
        // Check if there is reasonable suspicion of drug use
        if (suspicionOfDrugUse != null && !suspicionOfDrugUse.isEmpty()) {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

    private boolean isHighRiskJob(String jobTitle) {
        // Define which jobs are considered high-risk for safety concerns
        List<String> highRiskJobs = Arrays.asList("Driver", "Paramedic");
        return highRiskJobs.contains(jobTitle);
    }
}
```

#### Drug Testing of Private Employers

Background context: The Fourth Amendment does not apply to drug testing conducted by private employers. However, the privacy rights and drug testing of private-sector employees are governed by state law, which may allow or restrict certain types of testing.

:p What legal considerations do private employers face when conducting drug tests?
??x
Private employers can conduct drug tests without the restrictions imposed by the Fourth Amendment because this amendment only applies to government actions. However, they must comply with state laws that govern privacy rights and the conduct of drug testing:

- Many states have statutes allowing private employers to perform drug tests.
- These statutes often restrict when and how such tests may be performed.

Collective bargaining agreements (CBA) can also provide protections or authorize specific conditions for drug testing. The permissibility of testing a private employee for drugs often hinges on whether the employer’s actions were reasonable:

- Random drug tests have been considered reasonable.
- "Zero-tolerance" policies, which deny a “second chance” to employees who test positive, have also been found to be reasonable.

It is also reasonable to require employees under contract with the federal government to undergo standard background investigations that disclose potential drug use.

```java
// Example pseudocode for a private employer's drug testing policy
public class PrivateEmployerDrugTesting {
    public boolean canTestEmployee(String employeeID) {
        // Check if the test was conducted as part of a reasonable investigation or random selection
        if (isRandomSelection(employeeID)) {
            return true;
        }
        if (hasZeroTolerancePolicy() && needsToDisclosePotentialDrugUse()) {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

    private boolean isRandomSelection(String employeeID) {
        // Logic to determine if the test was randomly selected
        Random random = new Random();
        return random.nextBoolean(); // Placeholder for actual logic
    }

    private boolean hasZeroTolerancePolicy() {
        // Check if a zero-tolerance policy exists and needs to be applied
        return true; // Placeholder for actual logic
    }

    private boolean needsToDisclosePotentialDrugUse() {
        // Determine if the employee's background might indicate potential drug use
        return false; // Placeholder for actual logic
    }
}
```

#### Immigration Law

Background context: The United States did not have any laws restricting immigration until the late 19th century. However, recent years have seen an increase in important immigration laws that affect employment. The most significant of these are the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) and the Immigration Act.

:p What is the primary purpose of the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA)?
??x
The primary purpose of the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA), enacted in 1986, was to address illegal immigration by providing amnesty for certain groups of aliens living illegally in the United States at that time. IRCA also aimed to prevent employers from hiring undocumented workers through a system that sanctions such employers.

Key provisions include:

- Prohibiting the hiring, recruiting, or referring for a fee someone who is not authorized to work in the U.S.
- Establishing penalties for employers who violate these prohibitions.

```java
// Example pseudocode for an IRCA-compliant employer's hiring process
public class EmployerHiringProcess {
    public boolean canHireEmployee(Employee employee) {
        // Check if the employee has proper authorization to work in the U.S.
        if (employee.hasValidWorkAuthorization()) {
            return true;
        }
        // If not, apply penalties or sanctions as per IRCA
        return false; // Placeholder for actual logic and penalties
    }

    public class Employee {
        private String workAuthorization;

        public Employee(String workAuthorization) {
            this.workAuthorization = workAuthorization;
        }

        public boolean hasValidWorkAuthorization() {
            // Check if the employee's authorization is valid
            return "valid".equals(workAuthorization);
        }
    }
}
```
