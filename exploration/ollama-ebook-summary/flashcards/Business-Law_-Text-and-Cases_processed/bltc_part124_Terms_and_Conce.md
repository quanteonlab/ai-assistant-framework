#### Secured Transactions Overview
Background context: Paul Barton's property-management company, Brighton Homes, purchased several items under installment sales contracts. Six months later, due to business failure, he defaulted on these loans. The chapter discusses how creditors would secure their interests and handle defaults.

:p Which purchases by Barton would require the creditor to file a financing statement?
??x
The surround-sound system from KDM Electronics, the kayak from Outdoor Outfitters, and the iMacs from KDM Electronics would require filing a financing statement. The 4-Runner from Bridgeport Auto is typically not required as it falls under personal property unless specifically noted otherwise.

```java
// Pseudocode to illustrate the process of filing a financing statement
class FinancingStatement {
    void file(String debtorName, String collateralType) {
        // Logic to register with the relevant authority
        System.out.println("Financing statement filed for " + debtorName);
    }
}
```
x??

#### Debtors’ Name in Financing Statements
Background context: If KDM Electronics files a financing statement listing only Brighton Homes as the debtor’s name, it might have implications on the effectiveness of their security interest.

:p What would be the consequences if KDM Electronics filed a financing statement listing only Brighton Homes?
??x
If KDM Electronics files a financing statement with only "Brighton Homes" as the debtor's name without including Paul Barton's exact name, this could weaken or even invalidate the security interest. Creditors must use the exact legal name of the debtor to ensure their rights are protected.

```java
// Pseudocode for checking the accuracy of debtor names in financing statements
class FinancingStatement {
    boolean isDebtorNameCorrect(String filedName, String actualName) {
        return filedName.equals(actualName);
    }
}
```

#### Purchase-Money Security Interest (PMSI)
Background context: Barton's purchase of the 4-Runner financed through Bridgeport Auto could potentially qualify as a PMSI in consumer goods.

:p Which purchases would qualify as a PMSI in consumer goods?
??x
The 4-Runner purchased from Bridgeport Auto, financed with an installment sales contract, might qualify as a PMSI. PMSIs are security interests granted to sellers of goods that are paid for by the debtor with credit provided by the seller.

```java
// Pseudocode to identify PMSIs in consumer goods
class PmsiIdentifier {
    boolean isPmsi(String item) {
        // Logic to check if the item qualifies as a PMSI
        return "4-Runner".equals(item);
    }
}
```
x??

---
#### Repossession and Retention of Collateral
Background context: If KDM Electronics repossesses the surround-sound system but decides to keep it rather than sell, this action could be permissible under Article 9.

:p Can KDM Electronics retain the surround-sound system instead of selling it after repossession?
??x
Yes, under Article 9, KDM Electronics can retain the collateral (the surround-sound system) if they choose not to sell it. The key is that the sale must be commercially reasonable and the buyer must have notice of the security interest.

```java
// Pseudocode for commercial reasonableness in sales after repossession
class CommercialReasonableness {
    boolean isCommerciallyReasonable(double price, double marketValue) {
        // Logic to check if the sale price is within a reasonable range
        return price >= 0.8 * marketValue;
    }
}
```

#### Federal Bankruptcy Law Overview
Background context: The U.S. Constitution grants Congress the power to establish uniform laws on bankruptcy throughout the country, which led to the creation of federal bankruptcy legislation first enacted in 1898 and later amended by the 2005 Bankruptcy Reform Act.
:p What does the U.S. Constitution provide regarding bankruptcy?
??x
The U.S. Constitution grants Congress the power to establish “uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies throughout the United States.” This authority led to the creation of federal bankruptcy legislation, which has since been amended multiple times, including by the 2005 Bankruptcy Reform Act.
x??

---
#### Goals of Bankruptcy Law
Background context: The primary goals of U.S. bankruptcy law are to protect debtors from creditors' claims and to ensure equitable treatment among competing creditors while allowing debtors a fresh start. These goals were initially defined but have shifted slightly after the 2005 reforms due to concerns about debtors avoiding payment.
:p What are the two main goals of bankruptcy law in the United States?
??x
The two main goals of U.S. bankruptcy law are:
1. To protect debtors by giving them a fresh start without creditors’ claims.
2. To ensure equitable treatment among competing creditors who are vying for the debtor’s assets.
x??

---
#### Bankruptcy Courts and Proceedings
Background context: Bankruptcy proceedings occur in federal bankruptcy courts, which are under the authority of U.S. district courts. These courts can issue rulings that can be appealed to district courts, and they follow specific procedural rules different from those in civil cases. Judges are appointed for 14-year terms.
:p What type of court handles bankruptcy proceedings?
??x
Bankruptcy proceedings are held in federal bankruptcy courts, which are under the authority of U.S. district courts.
x??

---
#### Types of Bankruptcy Relief
Background context: The Bankruptcy Code is found in Title 11 of the United States Code and includes eight chapters with various types of relief for debtors, including Chapters 7 (liquidation), 11 (reorganization), 12 (for cooperatives and small businesses), and more.
:p What does the Bankruptcy Code contain?
??x
The Bankruptcy Code is found in Title 11 of the United States Code and includes eight chapters with provisions for various types of relief, including Chapters 7 (liquidation), 11 (reorganization), 12 (for cooperatives and small businesses), and others.
x??

#### Impact of Financial Crises on Retail Chains
Background context: Many retail chains have filed for bankruptcy in recent years due to factors such as increased online competition. For instance, Radio Shack, Sears, and Toys R Us have faced challenges leading to their bankruptcies. This trend reflects broader economic shifts impacting traditional brick-and-mortar businesses.
:p How has the retail sector been impacted by recent economic trends?
??x
The retail sector has been significantly impacted by recent economic trends, particularly the rise of online shopping platforms like Amazon. Many well-known retail chains such as Radio Shack, Sears, and Toys R Us have filed for bankruptcy due to struggling with increased competition from e-commerce.
x??

---

---
#### Monthly Income Statement
Background context: Debtors are required to provide a statement of their monthly income, itemized and calculated accurately. This document helps the court understand the debtor's financial situation and is critical for determining eligibility under Chapter 7 bankruptcy.

:p What should be included in the statement of monthly income?
??x
The statement should include detailed breakdowns of all sources of income such as salaries, dividends, rental income, and any other sources. Each source must be clearly itemized to show how the amount was calculated.
x??

---
#### Federal Income Tax Return
Background context: Debtors are required to provide a copy of their federal income tax return for the most recent year ending before filing the petition. This is used by the court to verify financial information and ensure accuracy.

:p What document does a debtor need to provide regarding their taxes?
??x
A debtor must submit a copy of their federal income tax return from the most recent year that ends immediately before they file the bankruptcy petition.
x??

---
#### Filing Schedules
Background context: Debtors must complete official forms accurately, swear them under oath, and sign them. Concealing assets or providing false information can result in criminal charges.

:p What happens if debtors fail to file required schedules within 45 days?
??x
If the debtor fails to file the required schedules within 45 days after filing the petition, the petition will be automatically dismissed. However, extensions may be granted.
x??

---
#### Tax Returns during Bankruptcy
Background context: Debtors may need to file additional tax returns while their bankruptcy case is pending. This can include requests from the court or U.S. trustee and is required for upper-income individuals to file Chapter 7.

:p When might a debtor be required to file an additional tax return?
??x
A debtor may be required to file an additional tax return at the end of each tax year during the bankruptcy case, either at the request of the court, U.S. trustee, or any party in interest.
x??

---
#### Substantial Abuse—Means Test
Background context: The bankruptcy court can dismiss a Chapter 7 petition if it is deemed a "substantial abuse" of bankruptcy law. The means test helps determine eligibility by comparing income to the median income.

:p What is the purpose of the means test?
??x
The purpose of the means test is to prevent upper-income individuals from abusing the bankruptcy process by filing for Chapter 7, forcing them instead to file under Chapter 13 where their debts are restructured.
x??

---
#### Basic Formula of Means Test
Background context: Debtors must complete the means test if they wish to file for Chapter 7. The comparison involves the debtor's average monthly income and the median income in their geographic area.

:p How is a debtor’s eligibility for Chapter 7 determined?
??x
A debtor’s eligibility for Chapter 7 is determined by comparing their average monthly income with the median income of the geographic area where they live. If below, no presumption of abuse; if above, further calculations are needed.
x??

---
#### Applying Means Test to Future Disposable Income
Background context: If a debtor's income is above the median, future disposable income must be calculated by subtracting living expenses and secured debt payments from monthly income.

:p What does the means test do with the debtor’s future income?
??x
The means test calculates the debtor’s future disposable income by presuming continued recent monthly income for 60 months. It then subtracts allowable living expenses and secured debts to determine what is available after all necessities.
x??

---
#### Living Expenses Allowance
Background context: The IRS provides formulas for calculating living expenses, which include modest allocations for food, clothing, housing, utilities, transportation, health care, and other necessities.

:p What are considered living expenses under the means test?
??x
Living expenses include basic allowances like food, clothing, housing, utilities, transportation (including car payments), health care, and other necessary costs.
x??

#### Involuntary Bankruptcy Requirements
Involuntary bankruptcy occurs when a debtor’s creditors force the debtor into bankruptcy proceedings. Key requirements for an involuntary petition include:
1. If the debtor has twelve or more creditors, three or more of these creditors having unsecured claims totaling at least $16,750 must join in the petition.
2. If a debtor has fewer than twelve creditors, one or more creditors having a claim totaling $16,750 or more may file.

Additionally, the court cannot dismiss a case if the debtor’s bankruptcy is necessary to satisfy a claim for a domestic-support obligation (Note 6).

:p What are the requirements for an involuntary bankruptcy petition?
??x
The requirements for an involuntary bankruptcy petition include:
1. If the debtor has twelve or more creditors, three or more of these creditors having unsecured claims totaling at least $16,750 must join in the petition.
2. If a debtor has fewer than twelve creditors, one or more creditors having a claim totaling $16,750 or more may file.

The court cannot dismiss a case if the debtor’s bankruptcy is necessary to satisfy a claim for a domestic-support obligation.
??x
---
#### Involuntary Bankruptcy Proceedings
In an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding, after the petition is filed and challenged by the debtor, the court will enter an order for relief if it finds either of the following:
1. The debtor is not paying debts as they come due.
2. A general receiver, assignee, or custodian took possession of, or was appointed to take charge of, substantially all of the debtor’s property within 120 days before the filing of the petition.

If an order for relief is granted, the debtor must supply information in the bankruptcy schedules similar to a voluntary bankruptcy.

:p What criteria does the court use to grant an order for relief in an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding?
??x
The court grants an order for relief if it finds either:
1. The debtor is not paying debts as they come due.
2. A general receiver, assignee, or custodian took possession of, or was appointed to take charge of, substantially all of the debtor’s property within 120 days before the filing of the petition.

If an order for relief is granted, the debtor must provide information in the bankruptcy schedules similar to a voluntary bankruptcy.
??x
---
#### Automatic Stay in Bankruptcy Proceedings
The moment a petition (either voluntary or involuntary) is filed, an automatic stay goes into effect. This suspension prohibits creditors from taking any act to collect, assess, or recover a claim against the debtor that arose before the filing of the petition.

The automatic stay normally continues until the bankruptcy proceeding is closed or dismissed. In some circumstances, it's possible to petition the bankruptcy court for relief from the automatic stay.

If a creditor violates the automatic stay knowingly (a willful violation), any injured party, including the debtor, can recover actual damages, costs, and attorneys’ fees. Punitive damages may also be awarded.

:p What is the effect of an automatic stay in bankruptcy proceedings?
??x
An automatic stay goes into effect immediately upon filing a petition (voluntary or involuntary) in bankruptcy. This suspension prevents creditors from taking any action to collect, assess, or recover claims against the debtor that arose before the petition's filing date.

The stay usually continues until the bankruptcy proceeding is closed or dismissed. If a creditor violates the automatic stay knowingly, the injured party can seek actual damages, costs, and attorneys' fees. Punitive damages may also be awarded.
??x
---

---
#### Bad Faith in Bankruptcy Petitions
The bankruptcy code presumes that a debtor acted in bad faith if they have two or more bankruptcy petitions dismissed within the preceding year. In such cases, the automatic stay does not come into effect until the court determines otherwise. Additionally, the automatic stay on secured debts will terminate after 30 days from the filing date if a petition was dismissed within the prior year.

If any party believes that the filing is in good faith, they can request an extension of the stay by providing evidence to support this claim.

:p What happens if a debtor has two or more bankruptcy petitions dismissed within the preceding year?
??x
The Code presumes bad faith in such situations. The automatic stay does not go into effect until the court determines that the petition was filed in good faith. Moreover, the automatic stay on secured debts will terminate after 30 days from the filing date if a petition was dismissed within the prior year.

This process ensures that courts can closely examine whether the debtor's actions were genuinely in bad faith or not.

#### Estate in Bankruptcy
When a liquidation proceeding under Chapter 7 begins, an estate in bankruptcy is created. This estate encompasses all of the debtor’s interests in property currently held, wherever located. It includes:

1. Community property (jointly owned by married persons in certain states).
2. Property transferred in transactions that can be voided by the trustee.
3. Proceeds and profits from the property of the estate.

Certain after-acquired property to which the debtor becomes entitled within 180 days after filing may also become part of the estate. Such property includes gifts, inheritances, property settlements (from divorce), and life insurance death proceeds.

Generally, property acquired before the filing of the petition belongs to the estate, while property acquired afterward remains with the debtor unless it is explicitly mentioned in the text.

:p What does an estate in bankruptcy consist of?
??x
An estate in bankruptcy includes all of the debtor’s interests in property currently held, wherever located. Specifically, it encompasses:

1. Community property (jointly owned by married persons).
2. Property transferred in transactions that can be voided by the trustee.
3. Proceeds and profits from the property of the estate.

Additionally, certain after-acquired property to which the debtor becomes entitled within 180 days after filing may also become part of the estate. This includes gifts, inheritances, property settlements (from divorce), and life insurance death proceeds.

The general rule is that property acquired before the filing belongs to the estate, while property acquired afterward remains with the debtor unless explicitly stated otherwise.

#### The Bankruptcy Trustee
Upon commencement of a liquidation proceeding under Chapter 7, a trustee is appointed. The primary duty of the trustee is to collect the debtor’s available estate and reduce it to cash for distribution, preserving the interests of both the debtor and unsecured creditors.

To assist in this task, the Code grants the trustee certain powers that must be exercised within two years from the order for relief.

Within ten days after the first meeting of the creditors, the trustee is required to review all materials filed by the debtor to determine if there is substantial abuse. The trustee must file a statement indicating whether the case is presumed to be an abuse under the means test and provide this statement to all creditors within five days.

If the case is presumed to be an abuse, the trustee must either file a motion to dismiss the petition or convert it to a Chapter 13 petition. Alternatively, if a motion would not be appropriate, the trustee must file a statement explaining why.

If the debtor owes a domestic-support obligation (such as child support), the trustee must provide written notice of the bankruptcy to the claim holder (a former spouse, for instance).

:p What is the primary duty of the bankruptcy trustee?
??x
The primary duty of the bankruptcy trustee is to collect the debtor’s available estate and reduce it to cash for distribution. This process aims to preserve the interests of both the debtor and unsecured creditors.

To facilitate this task, the Code grants the trustee certain powers that must be exercised within two years from the order for relief.

#### Proof of Claim in Bankruptcy
Background context: A proof of claim is necessary when there is any dispute regarding a claim. It lists the creditor's name, address, and the amount owed by the debtor to the creditor. In cases where the debtor has no assets ("no-asset" case), unsecured creditors are typically not paid, and most debts are discharged.
:p What is the purpose of filing a proof of claim in bankruptcy?
??x
The purpose is to formally document the debt asserted by the creditor against the bankrupt estate, ensuring that any disputes can be resolved. This process allows the court to determine the validity and amount of the claim.
x??

---

#### No-Asset Case in Bankruptcy
Background context: In a "no-asset" case, the debtor has no assets available for distribution to creditors. As a result, unsecured creditors are typically not paid, and most debts are discharged without repayment. The bankruptcy process focuses on the discharge of debts rather than asset liquidation.
:p What happens in a "no-asset" case?
??x
In a "no-asset" case, since there are no assets available for distribution to creditors, unsecured creditors do not receive any payment and most of their debts are discharged. The bankruptcy process primarily focuses on discharging the debtor's obligations rather than liquidating assets.
x??

---

#### Distribution of Property in Bankruptcy
Background context: The Bankruptcy Code provides specific rules for distributing the debtor’s property among secured and unsecured creditors. The distribution is prioritized based on different classes of claims, with higher-priority claims being satisfied first.
:p What are the general principles of property distribution in bankruptcy?
??x
The general principles involve distributing debtor's assets according to priority levels defined by the Bankruptcy Code. Secured creditors are given preference over unsecured creditors, and if there is any remaining property after all priorities have been satisfied, it is returned to the debtor.
x??

---

#### Secured Creditors in Bankruptcy
Background context: Secured creditors have a higher claim on specific assets that serve as collateral for their loans. In bankruptcy proceedings, secured creditors are prioritized over unsecured creditors regarding the proceeds from the disposition of collateral.
:p How do secured creditors get priority in bankruptcy?
??x
Secured creditors receive priority over unsecured creditors when it comes to the proceeds derived from the disposition or surrender of collateral. If the debtor surrenders the property, the secured party can either accept it as full satisfaction or sell it and use the proceeds to pay off the debt.
x??

---

#### Unsecured Creditors in Bankruptcy
Background context: Unsecured creditors do not have a specific asset pledged as collateral. Their claims are typically discharged if there is no available assets for distribution, but they may still recover some amount from the sale of secured property or other sources.
:p How are unsecured creditors treated in bankruptcy?
??x
Unsecured creditors generally receive little to no payment in "no-asset" cases where all debts are discharged. However, in cases involving secured property, any surplus proceeds after satisfying secured claims can be distributed to unsecured creditors.
x??

---

#### Administrative Expenses in Bankruptcy
Background context: Administrative expenses include costs incurred by the trustee or other professionals managing the bankruptcy proceedings. These expenses must be prioritized and paid before distribution of remaining assets to other creditors.
:p What is an administrative expense in bankruptcy?
??x
An administrative expense includes costs necessary for the administration of a bankruptcy case, such as compensation for legal counsel and trustees. In Chapter 11 cases, these expenses are typically paid before distribution to other unsecured creditors.
x??

---

#### Priority Classes in Bankruptcy Distribution
Background context: The Bankruptcy Code categorizes claims into different priority classes. Higher-priority claims are satisfied first, leaving the remaining assets available for lower-priority claims and ultimately the debtor if there is any surplus.
:p What are priority classes in bankruptcy?
??x
Priority classes determine the order in which claims are satisfied during bankruptcy distribution. Priority classes include secured creditors, then unsecured creditors, with certain types of debts like administrative expenses having higher precedence within those categories.
x??

---

#### Conversion from Chapter 11 to Chapter 7
Background context: A Chapter 11 case can be converted to a Chapter 7 liquidation if the debtor fails to propose and confirm a reorganization plan. In such cases, the trustee takes control of the estate assets for distribution among creditors.
:p What is the difference between Chapter 11 and Chapter 7 in bankruptcy?
??x
Chapter 11 focuses on reorganizing the debtor's business or personal affairs while keeping them operational. Chapter 7 liquidates the debtor's non-exempt assets to pay off unsecured creditors, typically leading to a discharge of most debts.
x??

---

#### Dismissal of Objection in Bankruptcy
Background context: Creditors can object to claims filed against the bankruptcy estate. The court decides whether such objections are valid and can dismiss them if the claim is supported by evidence. In the provided case, Stubbs’s objection was dismissed as the trustee excluded their unsecured claim.
:p What led to the dismissal of Stubbs's objection in this case?
??x
Stubbs's objection was dismissed because the court agreed with the trustee's decision to exclude Stubbs’s unsecured claim from distribution. The $702,630.25 available was not sufficient to pay both the IRS and Stubbs, so the court upheld the dismissal of Stubbs's objection.
x??

---

#### Reaffirmation Agreement
Background context: A reaffirmation agreement is an agreement to pay a debt that could be discharged in bankruptcy. Debtors may wish to make such payments, especially for debts owed to family members, physicians, banks, or other creditors. Additionally, to retain secured property, the debtor must enter into a reaffirmation agreement.
Relevant formulas: None applicable.

:p What is a reaffirmation agreement?
??x
A reaffirmation agreement is an agreement between a debtor and a creditor where the debtor promises to pay a dischargeable debt even after filing for bankruptcy. This can be done for various reasons, such as retaining secured property or paying debts owed to family members.
x??

---

#### Procedures for Reaffirmation Agreements
Background context: For reaffirmation agreements to be enforceable, they must be signed and filed with the court before the debtor is granted a discharge. Court approval may be required if it appears that the agreement will result in undue hardship to the debtor.

:p What are the procedural requirements for reaffirmation agreements?
??x
Reaffirmation agreements must be made before the debtor receives a discharge, signed by both parties, and filed with the court. If an attorney is involved, the debtor can avoid court approval if the documents and certifications are properly submitted. However, court approval may still be required if it appears that the agreement will cause undue hardship.
x??

---

#### Required Disclosures for Reaffirmation Agreements
Background context: To prevent abusive practices, specific disclosures must be provided to debtors considering reaffirmation agreements. These disclosures inform the debtor about their rights and obligations.

:p What are the required disclosures in a reaffirmation agreement?
??x
The required disclosures include:
- The debtor is not obligated to reaffirm any debt.
- Liens on secured property will remain even if the debt is not reaffirmed.
- Details of the amount, interest rate, payment start date, and right to rescind.
- A caution that only agree to reaffirm a debt if it is in their best interest and they can afford the payments.

The debtor must sign the original disclosure documents, which are certified by an attorney and filed with the court at the same time as the reaffirmation agreement. Failure to provide these disclosures will render the agreement ineffective.
x??

---

#### Case in Point: Reaffirmation Agreement Violation
Background context: The case involves Howard Lapides, who signed a reaffirmation agreement that was later found to be invalid due to procedural issues.

:p What happened in the Howard Lapides case?
??x
Howard Lapides, owner of a seafood import business, signed a secured promissory note for $400,000 with Venture Bank. After filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and having his personal debts discharged, he was encouraged by Venture Bank to reaffirm the debt in exchange for refinancing all three mortgages on their house. He made twelve payments of$3,500 but stopped when the bank did not refinance the other mortgages. The court refused to enforce the reaffirmation agreement because it had never been signed by Lapides’s attorney or filed with the bankruptcy court.
x??

---

#### Chapter 11 Reorganization
Background context: Chapter 11 reorganizations are commonly used by corporate debtors, where creditors and the debtor negotiate a plan for paying debts while allowing the company to continue operating.

:p What is a Chapter 11 reorganization?
??x
A Chapter 11 reorganization is a bankruptcy proceeding used primarily by corporations. In this process, the debtor (company) and its creditors collaborate to develop a reorganization plan that allows the debtor to pay off some of its debts while discharging others. The company can continue operating during the reorganization period.
