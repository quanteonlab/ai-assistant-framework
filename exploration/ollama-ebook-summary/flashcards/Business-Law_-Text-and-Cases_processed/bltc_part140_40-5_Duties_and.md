**Starting Chapter:** 40-5 Duties and Liabilities of Shareholders

---

#### Shareholders and Corporate Damages
When shareholders bring a derivative suit, they are not pursuing personal benefits but acting as guardians of the corporate entity. If successful, any damages recovered typically go into the corporation’s treasury rather than to individual shareholders.

:p How does a derivative suit affect shareholder recovery?
??x
In a derivative suit, if the claim is successful and there are damages awarded, these generally do not go directly to the shareholders personally but instead become part of the corporation's funds. The primary beneficiaries are the corporate entity itself.

#### Shareholder Liability for Corporate Debts
Shareholders in a corporation are typically not personally liable for the debts of the corporation unless specific circumstances apply, such as when a court pierces the corporate veil.

:p Under what conditions can shareholders be held personally liable?
??x
Shareholders generally are not personally liable for corporate debts. However, this rule has exceptions where courts may disregard the corporate entity and hold individual shareholders responsible. This typically happens due to illegal activities or mismanagement.

#### Watered Stock
Watered stock occurs when a corporation issues shares at a value below their fair market value. Shareholders receiving watered stock are often required to pay the difference to the corporation, potentially making them liable for corporate debts in certain states.

:p What is watered stock?
??x
Watered stock refers to shares issued by a corporation for less than their fair market value. The shareholder who receives these shares usually must compensate the corporation for the discrepancy between the issued price and the true market value. In some jurisdictions, such shareholders can also be liable to corporate creditors.

#### Majority Shareholder Duties
A majority shareholder may have a fiduciary duty towards both the corporation and minority shareholders if they control de facto the operations of the company.

:p When does a majority shareholder owe a fiduciary duty?
??x
A majority shareholder owes a fiduciary duty to the corporation and minority shareholders when they hold enough shares to effectively control the company's actions. This duty arises from their significant influence over the corporate decisions.

#### Example of Watered Stock
Incorporators may issue stock for less than its fair market value, making it watered stock. Shareholders receiving such stock are liable to pay the difference and can be held responsible for unpaid corporate debts in certain states.

:p Provide an example of a situation involving watered stock.
??x
During the formation of a corporation, Gomez transfers his property, Sunset Beach, valued at $1 million (market value) but recorded at only $500,000 on the company books. In exchange, he receives 10,000 shares at par value of $100 each ($1 million total). Later, it is discovered that the market value was actually$500,000. Gomez’s shares are thus watered stock, and he must pay the difference to the corporation.
```java
// Pseudocode to illustrate the discovery process
public class CorporationFormation {
    public void formCorporation(String property, double trueMarketValue, double recordedValue) {
        // Record value discrepancy if found
        if (trueMarketValue < recordedValue) {
            System.out.println("Watered stock detected");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Valid issuance");
        }
    }
}
```

#### Preemptive Rights
Preemptive rights give existing shareholders the opportunity to maintain their shareholding percentage when new stock issues occur. These rights allow them to purchase a pro-rata portion of any new stock before it is offered to the public, thereby preventing dilution of their ownership stake.

??x
Preemptive rights give existing shareholders the right to purchase additional shares in proportion to their current holdings before new shares are issued to the public. This prevents dilution of their ownership percentage.

#### Clifford v. Frederick Case
Clifford and Frederick each owned a one-third interest in an LLC. Clifford believed that Frederick had misused corporate funds for personal expenses, paid nonexistent debts, and diverted assets to his own separate business. Clifford hired an attorney and filed an action against Frederick for breach of fiduciary duty.
:p Can Clifford maintain the action against Frederick?
??x
Clifford can maintain the action because he is a member and co-owner of the LLC and has a valid basis for filing the lawsuit based on alleged misuse of corporate funds. The court will consider whether Clifford had the requisite knowledge to adequately represent the companies' interests. Even if Clifford lacked financial understanding, this alone may not preclude his right to bring the action, especially given the serious nature of the allegations.

#### M&M Country Store, Inc. v. Kelly Case
Debra Kelly bought M&M from Mary Millett with a conditional ownership agreement. During her management, Kelly failed to remit taxes, pay vendors, and maintain business licenses and insurance policies. The company incurred significant expenses after Kelly's default and surrender of the business.
:p Can M&M recover these costs from Kelly?
??x
M&M can likely recover these costs from Kelly if it is proven that she was acting in a fiduciary capacity or had a duty to manage the company properly. Under New York law, directors and officers owe duties of care, loyalty, and obedience. Kelly’s actions constitute dereliction of her duties as an officer, and M&M can sue for breach of these duties.

#### HP Case
Mark Hurd, CEO of HP, was involved in a scandal where he secretly monitored the phones and e-mail accounts of directors to find sources of information leaks. Later, it was revealed that Hurd had also lied about his personal relationship with an employee and falsified expense reports. Shareholders sued HP for fraud based on Hurd’s unethical behavior while promoting corporate integrity.
:p Did Hurd's actions constitute fraud?
??x
Hurd’s actions could be considered fraudulent if he misrepresented or omitted material facts to deceive shareholders, leading them to invest in a company that was not adhering to its own ethical standards. The key is whether the false statements or omissions were made with intent to mislead investors.
