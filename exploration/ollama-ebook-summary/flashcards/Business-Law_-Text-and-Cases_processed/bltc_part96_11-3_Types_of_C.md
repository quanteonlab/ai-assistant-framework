**Starting Chapter:** 11-3 Types of Contracts

---

---
#### Voluntary Consent Requirement for Contract Enforceability
Contracts may be unenforceable due to a lack of voluntary consent. This means that if one party entered into the contract under duress, fraud, undue influence, or mistake, the contract might not hold up in court.

:p What does "voluntary consent" mean in the context of enforceability?
??x
Voluntary consent implies that both parties agree to enter a contract freely and without any coercion, deceit, or misrepresentation. If either party did not willingly agree due to external pressures such as fraud, undue influence, mistake, or duress, then the contract may be considered invalid.

For example, if one party was forced to sign under threat of physical harm, the agreement would likely lack voluntary consent and thus could be unenforceable.
x??

---
#### Form Requirement for Contract Enforceability
Certain contracts must meet specific formal requirements to be legally enforceable. For instance, some agreements require a written document to validate their terms.

:p What does "form" refer to in contract law?
??x
The term "form" in the context of contract law refers to the procedural or documentary requirements that need to be satisfied for a contract to be considered valid and enforceable. In many jurisdictions, certain types of contracts must be in writing to meet legal formalities.

For example, real estate transactions often require written contracts because they are subject to statutory formalities.

#### Types of Contract Formation
Contracts can be categorized based on how and when they are formed, distinguishing between bilateral and unilateral contracts.

:p What is the difference between a bilateral and a unilateral contract?
??x
A bilateral contract involves an exchange of promises where both parties make commitments. The offeree accepts by promising to perform their part of the agreement, creating mutual obligations.

In contrast, a unilateral contract is when one party makes a promise in return for an act from another party. The offeror's acceptance only occurs upon completion of the specified performance.

Example:
- Bilateral: "I will pay you $500 if you fix my computer by this weekend." (Promise for a promise)
- Unilateral: "You get a reward if you find and return my lost wallet." (Promise for an act, accepted when the act is completed)
x??

---
#### Example of Bilateral Contract
Example 11.2 illustrates how a bilateral contract can be formed through mutual promises.

:p How did Jacob and Ann form their contract?
??x
Jacob and Ann formed a bilateral contract by making mutual promises:
- Jacob offered to buy Ann's smartphone for $400.
- Ann agreed to give the smartphone when Jacob pays her on Friday.

This exchange of promises constitutes a valid bilateral contract because both parties voluntarily committed to performing their respective parts upon payment.
x??

---
#### Example of Unilateral Contract
Example 11.3 provides an illustration of a unilateral contract where acceptance only occurs with the completion of the act.

:p How did Reese and Celia form their agreement?
??x
Reese and Celia formed a unilateral contract when:
- Reese offered $1,000 to Celia if she drives his car from New York to Los Angeles.
- Celia's acceptance was contingent on her actually driving the car to Los Angeles.

The offer was accepted only upon completion of the specified act. If Celia chose not to drive the car, there would be no legal consequences because she did not fulfill the condition for acceptance.

---
#### Doctrine of Quasi Contract
When an actual contract exists, the doctrine of quasi contract generally cannot be used to remedy a situation. If there is a valid and enforceable contract that covers the matter in controversy, the non-breaching party can sue for breach of contract rather than seeking a quasi-contract remedy.
:p When can the doctrine of quasi contract not be applied?
??x
The doctrine of quasi contract cannot be used when an actual contract already exists that covers the matter in dispute. The non-breaching party can seek remedies through the existing contract, such as suing for breach of contract.
x??

---
#### Example 11.11 - Fung's Claim
In the example provided, Fung contracts with Cameron to deliver a furnace to Grant’s building and delivers the furnace but never receives payment from Cameron. Despite Grant being unjustly enriched by not paying, Fung cannot recover from Grant because of an actual contract with Cameron.
:p Can Fung sue Grant for the price of the furnace in this situation?
??x
No, Fung cannot sue Grant for the price of the furnace because there is already a valid contract between Fung and Cameron. Fung can only pursue a breach of contract claim against Cameron.
x??
---

---
#### Plain Meaning Rule
When a contract’s writing is clear and unequivocal, courts will enforce it according to its obvious terms. The meaning must be determined solely from the written document, and the words used determine the intent of the parties at the time they entered into the contract.
:p What does the plain meaning rule state?
??x
The plain meaning rule states that when a contract is clear and unambiguous, courts will enforce it according to its terms as written. The court must interpret the contract based on the plain, ordinary meanings of the words used in the document.
x??
---

---
#### Ambiguity in Contracts
A court considers a contract ambiguous if the intent of the parties cannot be determined from the language, there is no provision for disputed terms, a term can have multiple interpretations, or uncertainty exists about a provision. Courts may interpret ambiguities against the drafter and consider extrinsic evidence.
:p What makes a contract ambiguous?
??x
A contract is considered ambiguous if:
1. The intent of the parties cannot be determined from the language used.
2. There is no specific provision addressing disputed terms.
3. A term can be interpreted in more than one way.
4. There is uncertainty about a particular provision.

Courts may interpret ambiguities against the party who drafted the contract and consider extrinsic evidence to clarify the meaning.
x??
---

---
#### Extrinsic Evidence
Extrinsic evidence is any evidence not contained within the document itself, such as testimony or other information that can help clarify an ambiguous term. Courts may use this evidence when interpreting a contract’s terms.
:p When can courts use extrinsic evidence in contract interpretation?
??x
Courts can use extrinsic evidence to interpret ambiguous terms in contracts if the language of the document is unclear or ambiguous. This includes testimony, prior negotiations, and other relevant information that helps clarify the meaning of the contract terms.
x??
---

---
#### Specific vs General Language Rule
In interpreting contracts, specific wording is given greater weight than general wording. If a term has both specific and general descriptions, courts tend to interpret it based on the specific description if present.
:p How do courts prioritize language in contract interpretation?
??x
Courts prioritize specific language over general language when interpreting contracts. This means that if a term has both specific and general descriptions, the court will give more weight to the specific description in determining its meaning.

For example:
```java
public class Example {
    // Specific terms like "shall deliver exactly 100 units" take precedence over general statements like "will deliver some units."
}
```
x??
---

---
#### Bilateral Contract
A bilateral contract involves both parties exchanging promises. The offeror makes a promise to do or refrain from doing something, and the offeree promises to do or not do something in return.

:p Define a bilateral contract.
??x
In a bilateral contract, both parties exchange promises where one party agrees to perform an act (or abstain from performing an act) in exchange for another party's promise. For example, Dyna promising to pay Ed $1,000 if he sets fire to her store would be considered a bilateral contract.
x??

---
#### Valid Contract
A valid contract is legally binding and enforceable under the law. It requires offer, acceptance, consideration, and mutual agreement.

:p What makes a contract valid?
??x
For a contract to be valid, it must meet certain criteria: an offer (a definite proposal by one party), acceptance of that offer (expressed as something like "I agree"), consideration (something of value exchanged between the parties), and mutual agreement (all parties understand and are in agreement with the terms). For instance, Monica entering a race under rules that include running 100 miles for a prize constitutes mutual agreement.
x??

---
#### Unilateral Contract
A unilateral contract involves one party making an offer to perform an act in exchange for another's performance of that act. The offeror promises to do something if the offeree performs a specified task.

:p What is a unilateral contract?
??x
In a unilateral contract, the offeree performs the requested action(s) to fulfill their side of the agreement, and upon completion, the offeror fulfills theirs. For example, Rocky Mountain Races offering $10,000 for completing a 100-mile race fits this description.
x??

---
#### Implied Contract
An implied contract is formed by the actions or conduct of the parties rather than an explicit agreement.

:p How does an implied contract form?
??x
An implied contract arises from the actions and circumstances surrounding the parties' behavior. For instance, when a nursing services firm provides care based on hospital requests and Janine receives benefits thereof without formal agreement, this can imply a contractual obligation.
x??

---
#### Quasi Contracts
Quasi contracts are not true contracts but obligations imposed by law to prevent unjust enrichment. They arise from situations where one party has benefited at the expense of another.

:p What is a quasi contract?
??x
A quasi contract arises when a party benefits at the expense of another, and it's deemed fair for the benefiting party to compensate the other. For example, Nursing Services Unlimited providing care based on hospital requests without formal agreement can lead to Janine being required to pay under a quasi-contract.
x??

---
#### Void Contract
A void contract is not enforceable by law because it lacks one or more essential elements of a valid contract.

:p What makes a contract void?
??x
A contract can be void if it lacks necessary components such as offer, acceptance, consideration, mutual agreement, legality, capacity, and certainty. An example would be a contract involving illegal activities like Dyna's request for Ed to set fire to her store.
x??

---
#### Voidable Contract
A voidable contract is valid until one party exercises their right to rescind it due to lack of consent, misrepresentation, duress, or undue influence.

:p What defines a voidable contract?
??x
A voidable contract remains binding unless one party chooses to annul it. For example, if Janine was under duress when she paid the incorrect taxes, she could potentially void that agreement.
x??

---
#### Executed Contract
An executed contract is fully performed by both parties or a single party has completed their part of the agreement.

:p Define an executed contract.
??x
In an executed contract, either both parties have fulfilled their obligations, or one party has already done so. For instance, if Monica successfully completes the 100-mile race in the ultramarathon and Rocky pays her $1,000 (though not as promised), it's considered executed.
x??

---
#### Informal Contracts
Informal contracts do not require formalities such as writing or witness signatures to be legally binding. They are typically based on verbal agreements.

:p What characterizes informal contracts?
??x
Informal contracts can take place without the need for written documentation and signatures, relying instead on oral agreements. For example, an agreement between friends to share a meal could fall under informal contract terms.
x??

---
#### Unenforceable Contract
An unenforceable contract is one that fails to meet legal requirements or conditions, making it non-binding.

:p What makes a contract unenforceable?
??x
A contract may be unenforceable if it lacks capacity (e.g., minors or incapacitated persons), involves illegal activities, or doesn't have consideration. For example, a contract involving an illegal gambling agreement would be unenforceable.
x??

---
#### Extrinsic Evidence
Extrinsic evidence refers to outside information that can clarify the terms of a contract when there is ambiguity in written agreements.

:p What is extrinsic evidence used for?
??x
Extrinsic evidence helps resolve ambiguities or misunderstandings in contracts. It can include emails, phone conversations, and other documents not directly part of the formal agreement but relevant to interpreting its meaning.
x??

---
#### Formal Contracts
Formal contracts require specific procedures such as writing and sometimes witnesses or notarization for them to be legally binding.

:p What are formal contracts?
??x
Formal contracts often necessitate written agreements, signatures, and possibly witness signatures or notarizations. They ensure greater legal certainty.

#### Why Was the Damages Award Reversed?

Background context: In Lawrence M. Clarke, Inc. v. Draeger, 2015 WL 205182 (Mich.App. 2015), Clarke filed a suit against Draeger for damages based on a theory of quasi contract. The court awarded $900,000 in damages, but an intermediate appellate court later reversed this award.

:p Why did the state intermediate appellate court reverse the damage award?
??x
The state intermediate appellate court likely reversed the damage award because it found that the work provided by Draeger and the subcontractors did not fall under a quasi-contractual obligation. A quasi contract is used to prevent unjust enrichment, but it typically arises from an actual contract or a situation where one party has been unjustly enriched at another's expense without any formal agreement. In this case, if the work was part of a valid contract between Clarke and Draeger, the damages should have been addressed through breach of that contract rather than a quasi-contractual theory.

Additionally, the appellate court may have found that there were other legal or procedural errors in the lower court's decision that warranted reversal.

#### Can Extrinsic Evidence be Admitted to Interpret the Bonus Term?

Background context: In Ortegón v. Giddens, 638 Fed.Appx. 47 (2d Cir. 2016), LBI offered Mary Ortegón employment as a "Business Chief Administrative Officer in Its Fixed Income Division" with a $150,000 salary and an annual minimum bonus of$350,000. The offer stated that the bonus was not a signing bonus but tied to her performance on the job. LBI rescinded this offer before Ortegón started work.

:p Can extrinsic evidence be admitted to interpret the meaning of the bonus term?
??x
Extrinsic evidence can typically be used to clarify ambiguities or interpret terms in a contract, provided that it does not contradict the plain language of the written agreement. In this case, if there were no other indications suggesting that the $350,000 bonus was conditional on performance, extrinsic evidence such as oral agreements, negotiations, or past practices might be admissible to interpret the meaning of the term.

However, if the contract's terms are clear and unambiguous, courts generally prefer to give effect to those terms without resorting to extrinsic evidence.
??x
If there were no other indications suggesting that the $350,000 bonus was conditional on performance, extrinsic evidence such as oral agreements, negotiations, or past practices might be admissible. The key is whether the written offer and any relevant communications clarify the nature of the bonus term.

In this case, since the offer stated that the bonus would not be paid unless Ortegón resigned or was terminated for certain causes, it appears to be a clear indication that performance on the job was required. Therefore, extrinsic evidence might not be necessary or admissible if the terms are unambiguous.

#### Can Newton Medical Center Recover Payment from D.B.?

Background context: In Newton Medical Center v. D.B., 452 N.J.Super. 615, 178 A.3d 1281 (App.Div. 2018), D.B., an indigent patient admitted to a mental health-care facility on an emergency basis, was not required by New Jersey law to apply for state assistance in paying his bill since he was involuntarily committed.

:p Can Newton Medical Center recover the amount of the unpaid bill from D.B. on a theory of quasi contract?
??x
Newton Medical Center cannot recover the amount of the unpaid bill from D.B. on a theory of quasi contract because, under New Jersey law, an indigent patient admitted to a medical care facility through the regular admissions process is responsible for applying to the state for assistance in paying the bill. However, if the patient is admitted on an emergency basis and the facility is required to apply for financial assistance, it can then bill the patient.

In this case, D.B. was admitted on an emergency basis, and Newton did not apply for state assistance. Instead, Newton billed him directly. Therefore, Newton cannot use a quasi-contractual theory because there is no indication that D.B. was unjustly enriched at Newton's expense without any formal agreement.

#### Ethics and Contract Requirements - The IDDR Approach

Background context: Mark Carpenter, a certified financial planner, contracted to recruit investors for GetMoni.com, which owned a defunct gold mine in Arizona. He then contracted with clients to invest their funds, collecting over $2 million but using only 20% of the money to develop the mine. The remaining funds were used to run a Ponzi scheme, and Carpenter kept another$1 million for himself.

:p How does this scenario relate to ethics and contract requirements?
??x
This scenario highlights significant ethical breaches and legal issues related to contract obligations and fiduciary responsibilities. Here are key points:

- **Contract Requirements**: Mark Carpenter breached his contractual duties by misusing client funds intended for legitimate investment purposes.
- **Ethical Issues**: Carpenter's actions constitute fraud, breach of trust, and unethical behavior as a certified financial planner.
- **Legal Implications**: Carpenter may face legal consequences including civil lawsuits, criminal charges, and disciplinary action from professional bodies.

The IDDR (Identify-Disclose-Decide-Respond) approach can be used to assess the ethical implications:

1. **Identify**: Recognize that there are ethical issues involved in misusing client funds.
2. **Disclose**: Inform clients of the misuse of their funds and take steps to return any misused amounts.
3. **Decide**: Actively work to rectify the situation, possibly by cooperating with law enforcement and regulatory bodies.
4. **Respond**: Ensure future actions comply with ethical standards and legal requirements.

In this case, Carpenter's failure to adhere to these principles resulted in significant financial loss for clients and potential legal ramifications.
