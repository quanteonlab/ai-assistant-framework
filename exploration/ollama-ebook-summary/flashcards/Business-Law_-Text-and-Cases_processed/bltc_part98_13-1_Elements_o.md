**Starting Chapter:** 13-1 Elements of Consideration

---

#### Bilateral Contracts and Consideration
Background context: In a bilateral contract, both parties exchange promises. Each promise serves as consideration for the other. For example, in a sale of goods, the seller promises to ship specific goods, and the buyer promises to pay for those goods.

:p What is the definition of a bilateral contract?
??x
A bilateral contract is an agreement where each party makes a promise that constitutes consideration for the other party's promise.

#### Unilateral Contracts and Consideration
Background context: In contrast to bilateral contracts, unilateral contracts involve one party making a promise in return for the performance of an action by another. For example, if someone promises to pay $800 upon painting a garage.

:p What is an example of a unilateral contract?
??x
An example of a unilateral contract is Anita promising to pay her neighbor $800 when the neighbor finishes painting the garage.

#### Consideration in Contracts
Background context: Consideration must be something of legally sufficient value given in exchange for a promise. It can include promises, performance, or forbearance from an action.

:p What are the elements that make up consideration?
??x
Consideration consists of two parts:
1. Something of legally sufficient value must be given in exchange for the promise.
2. There must be a bargained-for exchange.
x??

---
#### Legally Sufficient Value in Consideration
Background context: For something to constitute consideration, it must have legal value. This can include promises to do something not previously obligated to do, performing an action one is otherwise not required to undertake, or refraining from taking legal actions.

:p What are the three main components of legally sufficient value in a contract?
??x
1. A promise to do something that one has no prior legal duty to do.
2. The performance of an action that one is otherwise not obligated to undertake.
3. The forbearance from an action that one has a legal right to undertake.

#### Case Study: Hamer v. Sidway
Background context: This case, where William E. Story Sr. promised his nephew $5,000 if he refrained from certain harmful habits, tested whether such forbearance could constitute legally sufficient consideration.

:p In the Hamer v. Sidway case, what was the nature of the promise?
??x
In the Hamer v. Sidway case, William E. Story Sr. promised to pay his nephew $5,000 if he would refrain from drinking, using tobacco, swearing, and playing cards or billiards.
x??

---
#### Court's Decision in Hamer v. Sidway
Background context: The court had to decide whether the promise made by the uncle regarding forbearance from harmful habits was legally sufficient consideration.

:p What did the court determine about the promise in the Hamer v. Sidway case?
??x
The court decided that a promise of forbearance could constitute legally sufficient consideration, upholding the contract and obligating William E. Story Sr. to pay his nephew.

#### When Voluntary Consent May Be Lacking
Background context explaining that when there is a large disparity in the amount or value of the consideration exchanged, it may raise questions about whether voluntary consent was truly given. This could indicate fraud, duress, or undue influence.

:p In what situation might a court look closely at the validity of a contract due to a significant disparity in consideration?
??x
When there is a large disparity in the amount or value of the consideration exchanged, indicating that one party may not have freely consented to the agreement. The court may scrutinize whether fraud, duress, or undue influence was involved.

#### Shockingly Inadequate Consideration
Background context explaining that shockingly inadequate consideration can suggest that a contract lacks valid consideration due to issues like fraud, duress, or undue influence.

:p What could be the legal implication if a party later discovers that the device purchased under an unwise contract was counterfeit?
??x
If the discovered device is not authentic, there may have been no valid contract because of inadequate consideration and potential fraud. The party might sue to void the agreement.
x??
---

#### Unconscionability
Background context explaining that a one-sided and unfair contract might be considered unconscionable by courts.

:p Can you provide an example where a court might consider a contract unconscionable?
??x
Yes, if Spencer pays $1,000 for a counterfeit iPhone, the court could rule there was no valid contract due to shockingly inadequate consideration and fraud.

#### Preexisting Duty: Agreements That Lack Consideration
Background context explaining that a promise to do what one already has a legal duty to do does not constitute legally sufficient consideration.

:p What would be an example of a situation where a contract agreement lacks consideration due to preexisting duty?
??x
Ajax Contractors, having a preexisting contractual duty to complete the construction, cannot demand additional payment for the same work.
x??
---

#### Unforeseen Difficulties and Consideration
Background context explaining that extraordinary difficulties during performance can affect whether a new agreement has valid consideration.

:p How might extraordinary difficulties during contract performance impact the enforceability of an agreement to add extra compensation?
??x
If Ajax Contractors encounters unforeseen difficulties, demanding additional $75,000 for completing the construction is not supported by legally sufficient consideration because their initial duty was already defined in the original contract.
x??

#### Thirty Days’ Notice and Contract Consideration
Background context: In contracts, particularly those involving notice periods, the promise to give a certain amount of notice can create enforceable obligations. This is because it represents an exchange of value or consideration.

The legal right to hire someone else for the specified period may be relinquished by providing such notice.
:p What does giving Chris thirty days' notice entail in terms of contractual obligations?
??x
Giving Chris thirty days’ notice means Abe is relinquishing his ability to terminate the contract and hire someone else during that period. This provides Chris with an enforceable claim for two months’ salary, as he has effectively worked for the full month plus the notice period.

#### Requirements and Output Contracts
Background context: These types of contracts are characterized by uncertainty in performance because they involve ongoing needs or outputs rather than fixed quantities.

In a requirements contract, the buyer agrees to purchase all required goods from the seller. In an output contract, the seller promises to provide whatever output is produced.
:p What distinguishes requirements and output contracts?
??x
Requirements contracts obligate the buyer to purchase all of the designated type of goods needed by them, while output contracts bind the seller to supply whatever they produce.

For example, in a requirements contract:
- Buyer: A company needs 100 units of product X.
- Seller: Agrees to provide exactly that amount as required over time.

In an output contract:
- Buyer: Purchases all products produced by the seller (e.g., custom made goods).
- Seller: Produces goods according to their manufacturing process and supplies them to the buyer.

#### Accord and Satisfaction
Background context: This is a method of settling claims where one party offers a lesser amount than originally owed, and the other accepts it.

The key elements are:
1. An accord (agreement) on what will satisfy the debt.
2. Performance or satisfaction (usually payment).
:p How does an accord and satisfaction work?
??x
An accord and satisfaction involves a creditor accepting less than the full amount claimed in exchange for some form of performance, typically payment.

For instance, if a debtor owes $10,000 but agrees to pay only $8,000, this agreement constitutes an accord. The creditor's acceptance of $8,000 satisfies (satisfies) the original debt.

#### Liquidated Debts
Background context: A liquidated debt is one where the amount owed has been precisely determined by both parties.

Once a debt is liquidated, no further negotiation can result in an accord and satisfaction because the exact sum due is already known.
:p What is a liquidated debt?
??x
A liquidated debt is a debt whose amount is clearly and definitively established between the creditor and debtor. This means that both parties have agreed on the precise value of the debt, making it non-negotiable in terms of settlement amounts.

Example: A business loan with a fixed interest rate and repayment schedule.

#### Past Consideration
Background context: In contract law, consideration must be given for a promise to be valid. Past actions or events cannot be considered new consideration because they have already occurred.

If a person promises something in return for past services or events, there is no valid consideration.
:p What is past consideration?
??x
Past consideration refers to the situation where one party makes a promise as compensation for actions that have already been completed by another party. This does not qualify as new consideration because the work has already been done.

Example: If John builds Sarah's house and Sarah promises to pay him later, this promise is invalid under past consideration rules.
