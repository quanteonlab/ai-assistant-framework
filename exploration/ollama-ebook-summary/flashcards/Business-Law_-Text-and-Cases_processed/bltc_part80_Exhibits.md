#### Equitable Maxims
Equity is a distinct body of law that operates alongside common law. Equity’s principles are often articulated through maxims to guide judicial decisions.

:p What are equitable maxims?
??x
Equitable maxims are guiding principles used by courts in equity cases. They reflect the ethical and moral standards expected from parties involved in legal disputes, particularly when dealing with fairness and justice.
Example maxims include "He who comes to equity must come with clean hands," meaning a party seeking an equitable remedy must be free of any wrongdoing themselves.

```java
// Pseudocode for applying equitable maxim logic
if (partyA.isFreeOfWrongdoing()) {
    // Grant equitable relief to partyA
} else {
    // Deny equitable relief as partyA is not in clean hands
}
```

#### Procedural Differences Between Actions at Law and Equitable Relief
Legal actions and equitable remedies differ procedurally, reflecting their distinct principles.

:p What are the procedural differences between an action at law and an action in equity?
??x
Actions at law seek monetary damages or specific performance based on breaches of contract. They follow a formal court process with strict adherence to legal rules.

Equitable remedies, on the other hand, involve actions such as injunctions, specific performance, or declaratory relief. These are granted when monetary compensation is insufficient or inappropriate.

Key differences include:
- **Burden of Proof:** Actions at law require proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
- **Remedies:** Equitable actions often focus on preventing harm rather than providing compensation.
- **Court Process:** Equity cases may be less formal, with more flexibility in procedures.

Example procedural steps:
```java
// Pseudocode for filing an equitable action
if (courtBelievesJusticeNotServedByMonetaryCompensation) {
    fileEquitableAction();
} else {
    fileLegalActionForDamages();
}
```

#### National Reporter System—Regional/Federal
The U.S. legal system uses the national reporter system to publish and organize case law, which is essential for legal research.

:p What is the national reporter system?
??x
The national reporter system categorizes and indexes published court decisions by jurisdiction and subject matter. This system includes regional reporters (covering specific states) and federal reporters (covering all U.S. courts).

Example: Westlaw or LexisNexis databases use this system to organize cases for easy access.

```java
// Pseudocode for searching a case in the national reporter system
public Case findCase(String keywords, String jurisdiction) {
    if (nationalReporterSystem.containsKey(jurisdiction)) {
        return nationalReporterSystem.get(jurisdiction).search(keywords);
    } else {
        return null;
    }
}
```

#### How to Read Citations
Legal citations are necessary for referencing specific case law or statutes accurately.

:p How do you read legal citations?
??x
Legal citations follow a standardized format:
- **Abbreviation:** Identifies the source of the citation (e.g., "U.S." for United States Reports, "Fed. Cir." for U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit).
- **Volume Number:** The volume number in which the case appears.
- **Page Number:** The page on which the specific ruling or point is found.

Example: 523 U.S. 106 (1998) refers to Volume 523, Page 106 of the United States Reports from 1998.

```java
// Pseudocode for parsing a citation
public void parseCitation(String citation) {
    String[] parts = citation.split(" ");
    System.out.println("Abbreviation: " + parts[0]);
    System.out.println("Volume Number: " + parts[1]);
    System.out.println("Page Number: " + parts[2].replace("(", "").replace(")", ""));
}
```

#### Sample Court Case
Sample court cases are used to illustrate how legal principles and procedures work in practice.

:p What is the purpose of a sample court case?
??x
The purpose of a sample court case is to provide a real-world example of how legal principles, procedures, and doctrines are applied. It helps students understand the practical implications of theoretical concepts by showing them in action.

Example: The U.S. Supreme Court Case "Brown v. Board of Education" (1954) demonstrated the impact of segregation on education, leading to a landmark decision that abolished racial segregation in public schools.

#### Ethical Approaches to a Sample Dilemma
Ethical approaches involve considering moral principles when making decisions, especially in business contexts.

:p How do ethical approaches address dilemmas?
??x
Ethical approaches consider the moral implications of actions and aim to act in accordance with certain principles such as honesty, fairness, responsibility, respect for others, and legality.

Example: A company must decide whether to release a product that may be harmful but could bring significant profits. Ethical considerations might lead to delaying or discontinuing the product to prevent harm.
x??

#### Exclusive and Concurrent Jurisdiction
Jurisdiction refers to the authority of courts to hear and decide cases.

:p What is exclusive and concurrent jurisdiction?
??x
Exclusive jurisdiction means a court has the sole authority to hear a case. For example, a federal court may have exclusive jurisdiction over patent disputes.

Concurrent jurisdiction allows multiple courts to hear a case simultaneously. For instance, both state and federal courts might have jurisdiction over certain civil cases.
x??

#### State and Federal Court Systems
The U.S. legal system includes both state and federal court systems, each with its own structure and jurisdiction.

:p What are the state and federal court systems?
??x
- **Federal Courts:** Consist of the Supreme Court, lower courts including District Courts, and Circuit Courts.
- **State Courts:** Vary by state but generally include trial courts (such as circuit or superior courts), appellate courts, and supreme courts.

These systems have different levels of authority and jurisdiction.
x??

Background context: This concept introduces the idea that business law and the legal environment significantly influence business decisions. It explains how laws provide a framework within which businesses operate, ensuring they comply with various regulations.
:p How do business law and the legal environment affect business decisions?
??x
Business law and the legal environment play a crucial role in guiding business operations by setting forth rules that dictate what actions are permissible or not. For example, Hellix Communications Inc. must adhere to laws concerning mergers and acquisitions, data privacy, and pricing strategies.

```java
public class BusinessDecision {
    public void makeDecision(String decision) {
        // Check if the decision is compliant with legal standards.
        boolean isCompliant = checkLegalStandards(decision);
        
        if (isCompliant) {
            System.out.println("The decision complies with legal standards.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("The decision does not comply with legal standards and should be revised.");
        }
    }

    private boolean checkLegalStandards(String decision) {
        // Code to check compliance with laws related to the business decision.
        return true; // Placeholder for actual logic
    }
}
```

#### Law Violation of the Constitution
Background context: A law that violates the U.S. Constitution, when challenged, will be declared unconstitutional and not enforced regardless of its source. The Tenth Amendment reserves to states all powers not granted to the federal government, unless a state constitution conflicts with the U.S. Constitution or a federal law.
:p What happens if a state law violates the U.S. Constitution?
??x
If a state law is found to violate the U.S. Constitution, it will be declared unconstitutional and will not be enforced, even if it has been passed by the state legislature.
x??

---

#### Statutory Law
Background context: Laws enacted by legislative bodies at any level of government make up statutory law. This includes statutes passed by Congress or state legislatures, which are ultimately included in federal codes or state codes. Local ordinances from municipal or county governing units that regulate matters not covered by federal or state laws also fall under statutory law.
:p What is the difference between a federal statute and a state statute?
??x
A federal statute applies to all states, whereas a state statute only applies within the state's borders. State laws may vary from state to state.
x??

---

#### Statutory Conflicts
Background context: Tension can arise between federal, state, and local laws due to differences in their requirements or application. The U.S. Constitution provides that no law conflicting with it can be enforced at any level of government.
:p How is tension between federal and state laws resolved?
??x
Tension between federal and state laws is typically resolved through the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which states that federal laws take precedence over conflicting state laws.
x??

---

#### Uniform Laws
Background context: In the 1800s, differences in state laws created difficulties for businesspersons conducting trade and commerce among states. The National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL) was formed to draft uniform laws for states to adopt or reject. Even if adopted, these laws may be adapted by the state legislature.
:p What is the purpose of uniform laws drafted by NCCUSL?
??x
The purpose of uniform laws drafted by NCCUSL is to create consistent legal standards across multiple states to facilitate interstate commerce and trade.
x??

#### Example: Sanctuary Cities
Background context: The national debate over sanctuary cities involves local ordinances or policies that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. Normally, law enforcement should alert federal immigration authorities when they come into contact with undocumented immigrants for possible deportation. However, some cities have adopted policies not to follow this procedure.
:p How do sanctuary city policies typically affect the process of deporting undocumented immigrants?
??x
Sanctuary city policies often result in law enforcement officials not asking or reporting the immigration status of individuals they encounter, and sometimes refusing to detain undocumented immigrants for low-level offenses. This can impede the deportation process as federal authorities may not be notified.
x??

---

#### Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law
Background context: The Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law was one of the earliest uniform laws drafted by NCCUSL in 1896, and it became widely adopted by the 1920s. While many states adopted this law, they may not have used exactly the same wording.
:p What is an example of a significant uniform law from NCCUSL?
??x
An example of a significant uniform law from NCCUSL is the Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law, which was completed in 1896 and became widely adopted by the 1920s. This law provides consistent legal standards for negotiable instruments such as checks and drafts.

:p What is the significance of the common law tradition in the U.S. legal system?
??x
The common law tradition is significant because it forms the basis of American law due to the colonial heritage from England. Even today, judges continue to apply these principles when making decisions.
x??

#### Courts of Equity and Equitable Remedies
Background context explaining the concept. When individuals could not receive adequate relief from courts of law, they petitioned the king for help through chancellors who established formal chancery courts or courts of equity.

:p What is the primary difference between a court of law and a court of equity?
??x
The primary difference between a court of law and a court of equity lies in their remedies. Courts of law can provide monetary damages, while courts of equity grant equitable remedies such as specific performance, injunctions, or rescission.
x??

---

#### Equitable Remedies: Specific Performance, Injunction, Rescission
Background context explaining the concept. Equitable remedies are unique and not available from courts of law; they include specific performance, injunction, and rescission.

:p What is an example of a remedy in equity?
??x

These flashcards cover the key concepts from the provided text, providing context and explanations to aid in understanding rather than pure memorization.

#### Patent Royalties and Brulotte Decision
Background context: Under U.S. law, patent owners generally possess their right for twenty years during which they can license others (licensees) to use their invention for a fee (royalties). However, more than fifty years ago, the Supreme Court ruled in its Brulotte decision that licensees cannot be forced to pay royalties after the patent has expired. This means any contract specifying continued royalty payments post-expiration is invalid and unenforceable.
:p What was the core ruling of the Brulotte decision?
??x
The core ruling of the Brulotte decision was that licensees could not be required to pay royalties to a patent holder after the patent had expired. Any contract stipulating such continued royalty payments beyond the patent's life is invalid and unenforceable.
x??

---

#### Kimble Case Overview
Background context: In the Kimble case, Marvel Entertainment sued Kimble for patent infringement when he tried to negotiate a licensing agreement that involved a lump-sum payment plus a 3 percent royalty on all sales of his toy after the patent expired. Marvel argued and eventually won in the Supreme Court based on the Brulotte decision.
:p What was the outcome of the Kimble case?
??x
The outcome of the Kimble case was that the Supreme Court agreed with Marvel, ruling that the licensing agreement for continued royalty payments beyond the patent's expiration was invalid and unenforceable under the Brulotte decision. This means that once a patent expires, licensees cannot be compelled to pay royalties.
x??

---

#### Stare Decisis and Its Application
Background context: The doctrine of stare decisis is based on respecting precedent to ensure predictability and consistency in law. However, in the Kimble case, the Court adhered to this principle despite its potential impact on business practices and contractual agreements. Justice Kagan's opinion highlighted that patents provide a limited time "super power" to holders.
:p How does stare decisis relate to the Kimble case?
??x
Stare decisis relates to the Kimble case by emphasizing the importance of adhering to past judicial decisions for consistency in law. Despite potential economic inefficiencies or disruptions, the Court chose to uphold the Brulotte decision due to the principle of stare decisis.
x??

---

#### Ethical Considerations in Contractual Agreements
Background context: Justice Alito's dissent argued that the Kimble case decision interferes with parties' ability to negotiate fair licensing agreements and disrupts contractual expectations. The ethical question revolves around whether adhering strictly to precedent benefits or hinders business practices.
:p What was Justice Alito's main argument against the Supreme Court’s decision?
??x
Justice Alito argued that the Supreme Court's decision in the Kimble case interfered with parties' ability to negotiate licensing agreements based on the true value of a patent, and it disrupted contractual expectations. He believed that stare decisis should not require retention of an outdated and potentially damaging precedent.
x??

---

#### When Should the Supreme Court Deviate from Stare Decisis?
Background context: The Kimble case presented a scenario where strict adherence to stare decisis may lead to outcomes that are ethically questionable or economically inefficient. This prompts the question of when it is justified for the Supreme Court to deviate from its precedent.
:p Under what circumstances might the Supreme Court be justified in not following stare decisis?
??x
The Supreme Court might be justified in not following stare decisis when:
1. The precedent is based on outdated economic theories or facts that no longer hold true.
2. Adhering to the precedent leads to clear injustice or significant disruption of established practices (e.g., business operations).
3. New evidence or arguments emerge that convincingly demonstrate the previous decision was fundamentally flawed.
