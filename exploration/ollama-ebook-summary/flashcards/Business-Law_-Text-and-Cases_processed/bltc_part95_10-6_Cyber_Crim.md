#### Probable Cause for Arrest
Background context explaining the requirement of probable cause before an arrest warrant can be issued. Probable cause involves a substantial likelihood that the person has committed a crime, not just a possibility.

If there is no time to obtain a warrant, arrests can still be made based on probable cause.
:p What is probable cause in the context of making an arrest?
??x
Probable cause refers to a substantial likelihood that the individual has committed a crime. It means there must be reasonable grounds to believe that someone has engaged in criminal activity before an arrest can be made, even if a warrant hasn't been issued yet.

#### Indictment and Information
Background context explaining the formal charges required for bringing someone to trial. An indictment is issued by a grand jury, while an information or criminal complaint can be issued by a government prosecutor for less serious crimes.

If there is reasonable cause to believe that a crime has been committed, a charge (indictment or information) must be formally filed.
:p What are the two types of formal charges mentioned in this context?
??x
The two types of formal charges are an indictment and an information. An indictment is issued by a grand jury when there is probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed, while an information, also known as a criminal complaint, can be issued by a government prosecutor for less serious crimes.

#### Burden of Proof in Criminal Trials
Background context explaining the burden of proof during a criminal trial. The prosecution must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

If there is any reasonable doubt about the defendant's guilt, the verdict must be "not guilty."
:p What is the burden of proof required in a criminal trial?
??x
The burden of proof in a criminal trial is that the prosecution must prove the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. This means that the evidence presented must be strong enough to convince the judge or jury that there is no reasonable doubt about the defendant's guilt.

#### Cyber Crime and Fraud
Background context explaining the broad definition of computer crime and how it relates to cyber crimes, which are criminal activities occurring via the Internet.

Cyber fraud involves misrepresentations made with the intention of deceiving another person or entity for personal gain.
:p What is a common form of cyber fraud mentioned in this text?
??x
A common form of cyber fraud mentioned is advance fee fraud. This occurs when consumers order and pay for items, such as automobiles or antiques, that are never delivered.
x??

---

#### Advance Fee Fraud
Background context explaining the simplest form of advance fee fraud where consumers order and pay for goods that are not delivered.

The fraudster does not deliver the purchased item despite receiving payment.
:p What is an example of advance fee fraud?
??x
An example of advance fee fraud is when a consumer orders and pays for items, such as automobiles or antiques, but these items are never delivered. The fraudster collects the payment but does not provide the goods as agreed.
x??

---

#### Online Auction Fraud
Background context explaining online auction fraud where sellers refuse to send products after receiving payment.

Fraudsters can also send an item that is worth less than the one offered in the auction.
:p What is an example of online auction fraud?
??x
An example of online auction fraud includes a scenario where a person lists an expensive item for auction on either a legitimate or fake auction site, then refuses to send the product after receiving payment. Alternatively, the fraudster might send an item that is worth less than the one offered in the auction.

These flashcards cover key concepts from the provided text, focusing on the different aspects of arrests and trials as well as cyber crimes specifically related to fraud.

---
#### Polygraph Test Admissibility
Background context explaining the concept. In this case, Warner sought to admit the results of a polygraph examination as evidence. The Federal Rule of Evidence 702 governs the admissibility of expert testimony and states that an expert’s specialized knowledge can assist the trier of fact.
:p What is the reason the district court did not allow the polygraph examiner's testimony?
??x
The district court concluded that the polygraph examination was inadmissible under Rule 702 because it addressed an issue (whether Warner knowingly filed tax returns without authority) that was to be decided by the jury. Since Warner took the stand and answered similar questions, the jury could determine his credibility based on their own assessment.
x??

---
#### Business Records Admissibility
Background context explaining the concept. Government Exhibits 500 and 500A (spreadsheets of fraudulently submitted tax returns) were admitted as business records under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(6). This rule allows for the admission of certain records if they meet specific criteria.
:p Why were the government spreadsheets admissible as business records?
??x
The government spreadsheets were admissible because they met the criteria under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(6), specifically that they were made at or near the time by—or from information transmitted by—someone with knowledge. The original or duplicates are also available for examination or copying.
x??

---
#### Juror Indictment Copies
Background context explaining the concept. Warner sought to have each juror receive a copy of the indictment during trial, which is not standard practice in federal trials. This could influence their decision-making process.
:p Why did the court allow jurors to have copies of the indictment throughout the trial?
??x
The district court's decision to allow jurors to have copies of the indictment was within its discretion and not an abuse of it. Providing jurors with the indictment helps ensure they can refer back to it during deliberations, ensuring a fair and informed decision-making process.
x??

---
#### Standard for Reviewing Evidentiary Rulings
Background context explaining the concept. The standard used by courts when reviewing evidentiary rulings is whether there was an abuse of discretion. This involves checking if the court applied the wrong law or procedure, based on clearly erroneous facts, or committed a clear error in judgment.
:p What is the standard for reviewing evidentiary rulings?
??x
The standard for reviewing evidentiary rulings is whether there was an abuse of discretion. This means that the court's decision must not have been based on the application of the wrong law, followed the wrong procedure, relied on clearly erroneous facts, or committed a clear error in judgment.

#### Cyber Crime Overview
Cyber crimes are offenses committed using digital devices and the internet. These can include fraud, theft, illegal activities related to hacking, and more. Understanding these crimes is crucial as they have become increasingly common due to advancements in technology.

:p What type of crime does Dana commit by taking her roommate’s credit card without permission?
??x
Dana commits larceny or embezzlement when she takes her roommate's credit card without permission. Larceny involves the unlawful taking and carrying away of someone else's property with intent to permanently deprive them of it, while embezzlement refers to the fraudulent appropriation of property that one has been entrusted with.

```java
public class Larceny {
    // Code might involve simulating unauthorized use of a credit card.
}
```
x??
---

#### Identity Theft Example
Identity theft involves stealing and using someone else's personal information, such as Social Security numbers, bank account details, or credit card information, for fraudulent purposes.

:p Does Ben commit a crime by downloading consumer credit files without permission and selling the data to Dawn?
??x
Yes, Ben commits identity theft. He downloads and sells consumer credit files from a computer belonging to Consumer Credit Agency without permission, which is illegal under identity theft laws.

```java
public class IdentityTheft {
    // Code might involve unauthorized access to sensitive information.
}
```
x??
---

#### Phishing Scam Scenario
Phishing involves tricking individuals into providing personal or financial information through deceptive e-mails and websites. This can lead to significant financial losses and identity theft.

:p Identify the crime involved in Chen posing as Centell to gain Emily's credit-card number and password.
??x
Chen commits phishing, a form of cyber fraud. By sending an email posing as Centell and tricking Emily into providing her credit-card number and password, he is engaging in fraudulent activity through deceptive means.

```java
public class Phishing {
    // Code might simulate the process of sending a fake email.
}
```
x??
---

#### Cyber Scam Analysis
Cyber scams can involve various forms of deception to obtain money or personal information from unsuspecting victims. They often use social engineering tactics to manipulate individuals into giving away sensitive data.

:p Is Kayla's attempt to raise funds for her disabled child through fabricated emails a crime?
??x
Yes, Kayla commits fraud and possibly impersonation. By sending fake emails to strangers claiming to have a disabled child in need of financial help, she is using deception to obtain money, which is illegal.

```java
public class CyberScam {
    // Code might simulate the process of sending deceptive emails.
}
```
x??
---

#### Criminal Liability Case
Criminal liability involves holding individuals responsible for their actions. In certain cases, even if a person claims intoxication or loss of control, they may still be held accountable for their actions.

:p What crime could David Green potentially face after throwing objects from his hotel balcony?
??x
David Green could potentially face charges such as criminal mischief, public disturbance, and possibly assault. His actions are dangerous to others and constitute a public hazard, even if he claims intoxication or self-amusement was the primary motive.

```java
public class CriminalLiability {
    // Code might simulate video footage analysis for evidence.
}
```

#### Federal Sentencing Guidelines and Peters Case
Background context explaining the concept of federal sentencing guidelines. Discuss how the case involved wire fraud, the client's criminal history claim, and the sentencing outcome.

:p Was the sentence for Peters too harsh or too lenient?
??x
The sentence for Peters was not necessarily too harsh or too lenient. The judge sentenced him to 48 months imprisonment, which exceeded the federal sentencing guidelines but was less than the statutory maximum of twenty years. Considering that Peters's criminal history partly resulted from difficult personal times, including divorce, illness, and job loss, the court may have felt this sentence balanced the need for punishment with the client's circumstances.

The judge's decision to exceed the guideline range might be justified if the crime was particularly egregious or if Peters posed a significant risk. However, given that the sentence still allowed for some leniency (under 20 years), it does not appear excessively harsh in this context.

#### Protective Sweep During Norman’s Arrest
Background on the Fourth Amendment and protective sweeps during arrests. Discuss how officers can legally conduct a brief search of areas where a person might be hiding.

:p Would evidence from the "protective sweep" be admissible in Norman's trial?
??x
Yes, evidence from the "protective sweep" would likely be admissible in Norman’s trial. A protective sweep is a lawful, quick search conducted for officer safety and to prevent immediate danger. The officers had probable cause to believe that other individuals, including Norman's boyfriend, who had a criminal record and was suspected of identity theft, could still be present inside the house.

The Fourth Amendment allows officers to conduct a brief, cursory inspection in areas where a person might be hiding. In this case, the officers conducted a protective sweep within less than a minute, searching only those parts of the house where someone could reasonably be found. This is consistent with the legal standards for such sweeps and does not constitute an unreasonable search.

The key elements are:
1. The officers had probable cause to believe that others might be present in the house.
2. The sweep was limited in scope to areas where a person could hide.
3. The time taken (less than a minute) was reasonable under the circumstances.

Code example: This scenario does not require code, but here is an analogy of how officers might conduct such a search:
```python
# Pseudocode for officer's action during sweep
def protective_sweep():
    # Check visible areas first
    check_front_room()
    
    if probable_cause_of_person_inside:
        # Conduct quick inspection in possible hiding spots
        inspect_attic()
        inspect_basement()
        inspect_bathroom()

    return True  # No immediate danger found, sweep completed within a minute

def check_front_room():
    print("Checking front room for any signs of suspicious activity or individuals.")

def inspect_attic():
    print("Inspecting attic quickly to ensure no one is hiding there.")
```

#### Chigger Ridge Ranch and VPW Management
Background on lease agreements, property ownership, and the legal concept of unauthorized disposal. Discuss how Briscoe’s actions could be construed as criminal behavior.

:p Did Briscoe commit any crimes in managing CCR for VPW?
??x
Yes, George Briscoe likely committed a crime by selling some vehicles and equipment belonging to Chigger Ridge Ranch without authorization. The lease agreement identified all the vehicles and equipment that belonged to Chigger Ridge, which could be used during the business operations but did not convey any ownership interest.

By telling his employees to sell these assets and allowing them to proceed with the sale, Briscoe created a false impression among the buyers that he had authority to dispose of the property. He then used checks from the sales to an account only accessible by himself and his spouse, indicating fraudulent intent.

The crimes Briscoe could have committed include:
1. **Fraudulent Conversion**: Misappropriating goods or assets belonging to another party.
2. **Larceny**: Unlawfully taking possession of property with the intent to deprive the owner permanently.
3. **Embezzlement**: Misappropriation of funds that one has been entrusted to handle.

Code example: This scenario can be represented through a simplified model:
```java
public class AssetManagement {
    private boolean ownsProperty; // False, indicating lease agreement

    public void manageAssets() {
        if (!ownsProperty) { // Check if authorized to sell assets
            System.out.println("Unauthorized attempt to sell company assets.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Authorized management of assets within the terms of the lease.");
        }
    }

    public boolean hasAuthorityToSell() {
        return ownsProperty; // Return false, indicating no authority without explicit consent.
    }
}
```

#### Identity Theft and Broussard's Case
Background on identity theft, use of compromised accounts, and the legal concept of knowledge in criminal cases. Discuss how Broussard’s defense might be assessed.

:p Was Broussard guilty of identity theft based on his defense?
??x
Yes, Broussard was likely guilty of identity theft despite his defense that he did not know the misappropriated accounts belonged to real persons or businesses. The evidence against him included text messages indicating prior involvement in a similar scam and knowledge that packages would only be delivered if the FedEx accounts were "good."

The key points are:
1. **Prior Knowledge**: Broussard's own words suggest he was familiar with using compromised accounts for fraudulent activities.
2. **Intent to Deceive**: The fact that he used these accounts to distribute counterfeit money instruments implies an intent to deceive, which is a critical element of identity theft.

Even if Broussard did not explicitly know the specific individuals or businesses associated with the accounts at the time of his actions, the use of compromised accounts in a fraudulent scheme still constitutes identity theft. The court might find that he should have known better due to his prior involvement and the context provided by his own communications.

Code example: This scenario can be represented through a simplified model:
```java
public class IdentityTheftCase {
    private boolean usedCompromisedAccounts; // True, based on evidence

    public void assessIntent() {
        if (usedCompromisedAccounts) {
            System.out.println("Intent to deceive and use of compromised accounts suggests guilt.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Insufficient evidence for intent without direct proof of knowledge.");
        }
    }

    public boolean hadPriorKnowledge() {
        return true; // Based on text messages indicating prior involvement.
    }
}
```

#### Notify Authorities and Victims
Businesses must notify individuals whose personal information was stolen due to a data breach. Additionally, they should inform appropriate authorities. Companies may offer free credit monitoring and identity-theft protection services.

:p What are the requirements for notifying victims of a data breach?
??x
Notifying victims is required by law in 47 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. Businesses must inform individuals if their personal information was compromised due to a data breach. They should also notify relevant authorities about the incident.

```java
public class NotificationExample {
    public void notifyVictimsAndAuthorities(String[] victims) {
        for (String victim : victims) {
            System.out.println("Notifying " + victim);
        }
        // Notify Authorities code here
    }
}
```

#### Prosecute Hackers
Hackers identified after a data breach can face legal charges. For example, in the massive data breach mentioned earlier, five defendants were charged with unauthorized access of protected computers, wire fraud, and conspiracy.

:p What actions can be taken against hackers after a data breach?
??x
After identifying hackers responsible for a data breach, they can be prosecuted under laws such as the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and the Mail Fraud Act. For instance, in the described case, five defendants were charged with unauthorized access of protected computers, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit these crimes.

```java
public classProsecuteHackersExample {
    public void prosecuteHackers(String[] hackers) {
        for (String hacker : hackers) {
            System.out.println("Charging " + hacker);
        }
    }
}
```

#### Recover Losses
Businesses can mitigate financial losses from data breaches through cyber security insurance. This insurance covers costs related to data destruction or theft, hacking, and denial of service attacks.

:p How can businesses recover from the financial impact of a data breach?
??x
Businesses can recover from financial losses due to data breaches by purchasing cyber security insurance. These policies cover various types of online incidents, including but not limited to:

- Costs arising from the destruction or theft of data.
- Expenses related to hacking and denial of service attacks.
- Liability for privacy violations.

For example:
```java
public class RecoverLossesExample {
    public void purchaseCyberInsurance(int coverageLimit) {
        // Code to purchase cyber insurance with specified coverage limit
        System.out.println("Purchasing cyber security insurance with a coverage limit of $" + coverageLimit);
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Avoid Sanctions
Businesses can avoid government sanctions by ensuring robust cybersecurity measures. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) may sue businesses that fail to protect customer data adequately, potentially resulting in fines and long-term oversight.

:p How can a business avoid government sanctions related to data breaches?
??x
To avoid government sanctions, businesses should implement strong security measures to prevent attacks on their systems. If hackers steal personal information from the company’s computer system, the business may face legal action by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC might sue the business and impose fines or oversee its data protection for up to twenty years.

```java
public class AvoidSanctionsExample {
    public void implementSecurityMeasures() {
        // Code to implement security measures such as strong encryption, regular audits, etc.
        System.out.println("Implementing robust cybersecurity measures");
    }
}
```

#### Function of Contract Law
Contract law provides stability, predictability, and certainty for buyers and sellers in the marketplace. It ensures that promises made between parties are enforceable, thus promoting trust and reliability in contractual agreements.

:p What is the primary purpose of contract law?
??x
The primary purpose of contract law is to ensure that promises made by parties are enforceable, providing stability, predictability, and certainty for buyers and sellers in the marketplace. This ensures that all parties can rely on each other's commitments, fostering trust and reliability.

```java
// Example code snippet to illustrate a simple contract agreement
public class ContractExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Simulate an agreement where one party agrees to provide goods/services in exchange for payment
        String promisor = "Party A";
        String promisee = "Party B";
        boolean enforceablePromise = true; // Assuming the promise is legally binding

        if (enforceablePromise) {
            System.out.println(promisor + " has agreed to perform an act, and " + promisee + " can expect that action.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("The agreement lacks legal backing, so it cannot be enforced.");
        }
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Sources of Contract Law
Contract law primarily originates from the common law. However, statutory laws like the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) and administrative agency regulations may modify or replace some aspects of common law.

:p What are the main sources of contract law?
??x
The main sources of contract law include the common law, which governs most contracts, but can be modified or replaced by statutory laws such as the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), or by administrative agency regulations. For instance, contracts related to services, real estate, employment, and insurance are typically governed by common law unless specifically altered by UCC provisions.

```java
// Example code snippet illustrating how contract law sources might interact
public class ContractLawSources {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String serviceContract = "Governs by Common Law";
        String goodsContract = "Governed by UCC, subject to modification";

        System.out.println(serviceContract);
        System.out.println(goodsContract);
    }
}
```

#### Overview of Contract Law
The legal principles of contract law are designed to address the formation and enforcement of promises. It covers a wide range of agreements, from simple personal transactions to complex business arrangements.

:p What does an overview of contract law include?
??x
An overview of contract law includes understanding fundamental concepts such as the sources (common law, UCC, administrative regulations), general functions, and specific theories like the objective theory of contracts. It aims to ensure that promises are enforceable, reflecting societal values on binding commitments.

```java
// Example code snippet illustrating key elements of contract law
public class ContractOverview {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String source = "Common Law";
        boolean modifiedByUCC = false; // For simplicity, assume no specific UCC modification

        System.out.println("The primary legal framework for contracts is the " + source);
        if (modifiedByUCC) {
            System.out.println("Some provisions may be modified by the Uniform Commercial Code.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("No modifications to common law by UCC in this context.");
        }
    }
}
```
x??

#### Formation of Promises
A promise is a declaration by an individual (promisor) to do or not do a certain act, which gives the recipient (promisee) a right to expect or demand future actions.

:p What defines a promise under contract law?
??x
Under contract law, a promise is a declaration made by one party (the promisor) to perform or refrain from performing a specific act. This declaration creates an expectation in the other party (the promisee) that they have a right to rely on the promisor's commitment for future actions.

```java
// Example code snippet illustrating the concept of promises
public class PromiseExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String promisor = "Alice";
        String promisee = "Bob";
        boolean promisorAgreesToDeliver = true; // Assuming Alice agrees to deliver goods

        if (promisorAgreesToDeliver) {
            System.out.println(promisor + " promises to perform an act, and thus, " + promisee + " has a right to expect that action.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Alice does not agree to the delivery, so no promise is formed.");
        }
    }
}
```
x??

#### Moral vs. Legal Promises
Contract law distinguishes between promises that create only moral obligations and those that are legally binding. This distinction affects how breaches of contract can be enforced.

:p What is the difference between a moral obligation and a legal promise?
??x
In contract law, a moral obligation refers to commitments made by individuals based on personal ethics or social norms but not enforceable through legal means. A legal promise, on the other hand, is a commitment that has been agreed upon in a way that is recognized by law and can be enforced if breached.

```java
// Example code snippet illustrating the difference between moral obligations and legal promises
public class ObligationExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String moralPromise = "Promise to take a friend for lunch"; // A moral obligation
        String legalPromise = "Promise to pay for ordered goods online"; // Legally binding

        System.out.println("Moral obligation: " + moralPromise);
        System.out.println("Legal promise: " + legalPromise);
    }
}
```
