**Starting Chapter:** 33-1 Scope of Agents Authority

---

#### Equal Dignity Rule and Ratification
Background context: The equal dignity rule requires that for a contract involving an interest in real property, both the contract and the agent's authority must be in writing. If this requirement is not met, the contract may be voidable by the principal.

:p What is the equal dignity rule?
??x
The equal dignity rule stipulates that when a contract involves an interest in real property, both the contract itself and the agent’s authority to enter into such a contract must be in writing. If either the contract or the written authorization of the agent's authority is missing, the contract can be voidable by the principal.
x??

---

#### Agent's Authority Through Ratification
Background context: An agent’s authority can be actual (express or implied) or apparent. If an agent acts outside their authority, the principal may still become liable if they ratify the contract.

:p How does ratification affect the liability of a principal?
??x
Ratification allows a principal to become legally bound by a contract that was entered into by an unauthorized agent. Once ratified, the principal acknowledges and confirms the validity of the contract, making them liable for its terms.
x??

---

#### Exception: Oral Authorization in Presence of Principal
Background context: In some situations, oral authorization can suffice as long as it is given in the presence of the principal or under certain specific conditions.

:p Can an agent's authority be ratified orally?
??x
Yes, if a principal authorizes an agent to act verbally and the agent acts within that authorization, the principal can ratify the transaction later. For example, if Sandra Healy (the principal) verbally authorizes Derek Santini to sign a contract while she is present, this oral authorization is sufficient.
x??

---

#### Scope of Agent’s Authority
Background context: An agent's authority can be either actual (express or implied) or apparent. The liability of the principal depends on whether the agent had the authority to enter into legally binding contracts.

:p What determines a principal's liability for an agent's actions?
??x
A principal's liability for an agent’s actions is determined by the scope of the agent's authority. If the agent acts within their actual or implied authority, the principal can be held liable. However, if the contract was entered into outside the agent’s authority and subsequently ratified by the principal, the principal may still become liable.
x??

---

#### Executives Conducting Business Transactions
Background context: Executive officers of corporations typically have authority to conduct ordinary business transactions without formal written authorization from the corporation.

:p Can an executive officer of a corporation enter into contracts without explicit written authority?
??x
Yes, an executive officer can usually enter into routine and ordinary business transactions on behalf of the corporation without needing specific written authorization. This is because their role implies a certain level of delegated authority.
x??

---

#### Formalities for Signing Contracts
Background context: If signing a contract is merely a formality, an agent may not need formal written authority to sign it.

:p When does an agent’s signature on a contract require explicit written authorization?
??x
An agent's signature may not need explicit written authorization if the act of signing is simply a formal requirement. For instance, if the signing process is purely ceremonial and does not involve making any significant decisions, the agent can sign without additional written authority.
x??

---

#### Liability in Agency Relationships
Background context: In agency relationships, the liability of the principal to third parties depends on whether the agent had actual or apparent authority.

:p Can a principal be held liable for an agent's unauthorized actions?
??x
Yes, a principal can become liable if their agent acts outside the scope of their authority and the principal subsequently ratifies that action. For example, if Amelia (the agent) signs a contract for a major renovation without Premier’s authorization, Premier may still be liable if they later ratify Amelia's actions.
x??

---

#### Real World Example: Contracting with Maintenance Workers
Background context: If an agent enters into a contract on behalf of the principal without explicit authority and the principal subsequently approves it, the principal can be held liable for the terms of the contract.

:p Can Premier (the principal) be held responsible if Amelia signs a contract for major renovations that Premier did not authorize?
??x
Yes, if Amelia signs a contract for a major renovation on behalf of Premier without explicit authorization and later, Premier ratifies Amelia's actions, then Premier can be held responsible for the terms of the contract.
x??

---
#### Apparent Authority and Agency
Background context explaining that apparent authority occurs when a principal (Church) allows circumstances to lead a third party (Lundbergs) to believe that an agent (Bagley) has authority beyond what is actually granted. This is established through actions like approvals, allowing the agent to manage daily operations, and making the agent available for public contact.
:p What does apparent authority mean in this context?
??x
Apparent authority refers to a situation where a principal knowingly permits their agent to assume certain powers or holds the agent out as possessing certain authorities. In this case, Church permitted Bagley to handle all matters of the farm and interact with the public, leading the Lundbergs to believe Bagley had full managerial control.
x??

---
#### Legal Steps for Protection Against Apparent Authority
Background context discussing that a principal might take steps to prevent such findings by ensuring clear communication and documentation regarding actual authority. This could involve explicit written agreements or direct notifications to all third parties about the true extent of an agent's power.
:p What steps could Church have taken to protect himself against finding apparent authority?
??x
Church could have protected himself by explicitly documenting Bagley’s actual authority, communicating these limitations clearly to all potential third parties (like the Lundbergs), and ensuring that there were no preprinted signature lines or approvals for Bagley in official documents. Additionally, he should have ensured that any lease agreements required explicit approval from him rather than just relying on an agent's actions.
x??

---
#### Ethical Obligation of a Principal
Background context explaining the ethical responsibility of a principal to inform unaware third parties about apparent agents who do not actually hold full authority. The ethical question revolves around transparency and ensuring no one is misled by apparent authority that does not exist in reality.
:p Does a principal have an ethical responsibility to inform an unaware third party if their agent's apparent authority is limited?
??x
Yes, a principal has an ethical responsibility to inform any unaware third parties about the actual extent of an agent’s authority. This transparency prevents misrepresentation and protects both the third party and the principal from potential legal disputes. For instance, in the case involving Church Farm, if Church had informed the Lundbergs that Bagley only handled routine operations and needed his explicit approval for major decisions, this would have avoided the dispute.
x??

---
#### Condominium Association Rules
Background context explaining that condominium associations have rules about leasing units, specifically requiring owners to provide leases for review. The bylaws of Dearborn West Village Condominiums restrict single-family residential use leases when the owner is transferred out of state and require such leases to be reviewed.
:p What are the key rules regarding leasing in the Dearborn West Village Condominium complex?
??x
The key rule is that condominium owners can lease their units for single-family residential use only if they are transferred out of the state. Furthermore, the owner must first provide a lease document to the association for its review before any such lease can be considered valid.
x??

---

---
#### Express Authority
Express authority refers to the authority given by a principal explicitly. This can be documented or verbally communicated, giving the agent clear permission to act on behalf of the principal.
:p What is express authority?
??x
Express authority is the explicit authorization granted by a principal to an agent, which allows the agent to act for and bind the principal in contracts with third parties. This authority must be clearly stated; it can be written or verbal but must leave no doubt about the scope of the agent's power.
x??

---
#### Apparent Authority
Apparent authority arises when a principal’s conduct leads a third party to believe that an agent has the right to act on behalf of the principal, even if this belief is unreasonable. This creates a legal fiction where the principal and third party are bound in contract based on this apparent authorization.
:p What is apparent authority?
??x
Apparent authority occurs when a principal’s actions or representations make it appear that an agent has the authority to act on their behalf, despite the absence of explicit instructions from the principal. This creates a legal obligation as if the authority had been expressly granted. For example, if a principal regularly signs contracts with a specific agent, and a third party reasonably believes this gives the agent authority, both are bound by those contracts.
x??

---
#### Unauthorized Acts
Unauthorized acts occur when an agent performs actions that go beyond their express, implied, or apparent authority. These acts do not bind the principal to the contract unless ratified beforehand.
:p What is an unauthorized act?
??x
An unauthorized act is any action taken by an agent that exceeds the scope of their explicit, implied, or apparent authority given by a principal. Such actions do not create legal obligations for the principal and third party unless the principal later ratifies them before the third party withdraws from the agreement.
x??

---
#### Implied Authority
Implied authority refers to the authority inferred from customs, the agent’s position within the organization, or necessary duties required to perform explicitly authorized tasks. This allows an agent to take reasonable actions that are not strictly listed as their responsibilities but are essential for completing the principal's objectives.
:p What is implied authority?
??x
Implied authority involves the inference of authority based on custom, the agent’s position in the organization, or necessary actions required to fulfill explicitly authorized duties. This allows an agent to perform reasonable tasks that may not be explicitly listed as part of their responsibilities but are essential for completing the principal's objectives.
x??

---
#### Ratification
Ratification is when a principal affirms and accepts responsibility for an unauthorized act performed by an agent. Once ratified, the principal becomes bound to the act, treating it as if it had been initially authorized.
:p What is ratification?
??x
Ratification occurs when a principal agrees to and accepts responsibility for actions taken by their agent that were previously unauthorized. This acceptance makes the principal legally responsible for the act, even though it was not initially authorized. Ratification can be either express (clearly stated) or implied (inferred from circumstances).
x??

---
#### Requirements for Ratification
For ratification to be valid, several conditions must be met: the agent must have acted on behalf of an identified principal who subsequently ratifies the action; the principal must know all material facts involved; the principal must affirm the act entirely and have legal capacity; and the principal must do so before the third party withdraws from the transaction.
:p What are the requirements for ratification?
??x
For valid ratification, several conditions must be met:
1. The agent must have acted on behalf of an identified principal who subsequently ratifies the action.
2. The principal must know all material facts involved in the transaction.
3. The principal must affirm the agent’s act entirely and have legal capacity to authorize the transaction.
4. The principal must do so before the third party withdraws from the transaction.
5. The principal must observe the same formalities required to initially authorize the act.
x??

---

#### Unauthorized Acts
Background context: If an agent acts without authority, they are personally liable for any contracts entered into. The principal is not held responsible unless the third party was actually or constructively aware of their lack of authority.

:p In what situation is an agent personally liable for a contract even if the agent has no authority?
??x
An agent is personally liable when they enter into a contract without proper authority, as long as the third party is unaware that the agent lacks such authority. The principal is not held responsible unless the third party was actually or constructively aware of the lack of authority.

Example scenario:
```java
public class UnauthorizedAct {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Agent Chu = new Agent("Chu");
        Principal Navarro = new Principal("Navarro");
        
        // Chu signs a contract without authority from Navarro.
        Contract truckContract = Chu.signsContractForPurchase(Navarro, "Truck");

        // If Navarro refuses to pay for the truck, the seller can hold Chu liable.
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Implied Warranty of Authority
Background context: When a principal is disclosed or partially disclosed and an agent enters into a contract without authority, the agent breaches an implied warranty of authority. The third party can sue the agent for breach of this warranty rather than holding the principal responsible.

:p What happens if an agent contracts with a third party without authorization but the principal is disclosed or partially disclosed?
??x
The agent is liable to the third party based on breaching the implied warranty of authority. This means that even though the agent acts beyond their authority, they are personally responsible for the contract. The principal cannot be held liable unless the third party knew about the lack of authority.

Example scenario:
```java
public class ImpliedWarranty {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Artist Pinnell = new Artist("Pinnell");
        Agent Auber = new Agent("Auber");
        
        // Pinnell hires Auber to solicit offers for paintings but does not authorize sales agreements.
        Offer offer = Auber.solicitsOffer(Pinnell, "Two Paintings");

        // If Auber enters into a contract with Olaf, she is liable for the implied warranty of authority.
    }
}
```
x??

---

#### Third Party’s Knowledge
Background context: The agent's liability can be avoided if the third party knew at the time the contract was made that the agent lacked authority. Alternatively, if the agent did not clearly express their authority limits to the third party, the agent is not personally liable.

:p What happens if a third party knows the agent does not have authority when entering into a contract?
??x
If the third party knew at the time of contracting that the agent did not have authority, then the agent would not be personally liable. This means that the principal cannot be held responsible either unless the third party had actual or constructive knowledge of the lack of authority.

Example scenario:
```java
public class ThirdPartyKnowledge {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Agent Auber = new Agent("Auber");
        ThirdParty Olaf = new ThirdParty("Olaf");

        // If Olaf knew Auber did not have authority to enter into a contract.
        Contract contract = Auber.signsContract(Olaf, "Paintings");

        // Since Olaf was aware of the lack of authority, Auber is not liable.
    }
}
```
x??

#### Actions by E-Agents
Background context: The Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA) allows e-agents to enter into binding agreements on behalf of their principals. However, if errors are made without a clear opportunity for the user to correct them, the other party can avoid the transaction.

:p How do e-agents function under UETA?
??x
E-agents, being semiautonomous software programs, can enter into binding agreements with third parties on behalf of their principals according to the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA). However, if an error is made in a transaction and there was no clear opportunity for the user to prevent or correct it, the other party has the right to avoid the transaction.

Example scenario:
```java
public class EAgent {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        EAgent eAgent = new EAgent("e-Agent");
        
        // An order is placed over the internet.
        Order order = eAgent.placeOrder(Customer, "Product");

        // If there was no on-screen confirmation and an error occurred,
        // the customer can avoid the transaction.
    }
}
```

#### Apparent Implied Authority
Ainsley, as a demonstrator for Pavlovich’s products, has been given authority to make statements about the products. However, if Ainsley makes false claims and these claims are deemed to give third parties reasonable grounds to believe that Ainsley has such authority, then even though his statements were true, Pavlovich could still be held liable.
:p What does "apparent implied authority" mean in this context?
??x
In the context of agency law, apparent implied authority occurs when a principal (Pavlovich) places an agent (Ainsley) in a position that makes it possible for the agent to fraudulently misrepresent or make false claims. Even if Ainsley’s statements are true, if third parties reasonably believe Ainsley has such authority due to his position and actions, Pavlovich can be held liable for any injuries or damages caused by these false representations.
??x
```
public class AgencyLaw {
    public void demonstrateProduct(Ainsley ainsley) {
        // Code that demonstrates how Ainsley's actions create apparent implied authority
        if (ainsley.makeStatement()) {  // Ainsley makes a statement about the product
            if (ainsley.statementIsTrue() && thirdPartyBelievesInAinsleysAuthority()) {
                // Pavlovich could still be held liable for false claims
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Partner Liability in Saulheim & Company
Saulheim & Company is a securities brokerage firm that operates as a partnership. The managing partner, Dan Saulheim, embezzles client funds for investment purposes. In this situation, other partners may be held liable if it can be shown that Saulheim had apparent implied authority to act within the ordinary course of the firm's business.
:p How might other partners in Saulheim & Company be held liable?
??x
In a partnership like Saulheim & Company, if one partner (Dan Saulheim) embezzles client funds and his actions are considered to give third parties a reasonable belief that he had authority to act on behalf of the firm, then the entire partnership—and often the personal assets of the other partners—can be held liable for the losses incurred.
??x
```
public class PartnershipLiability {
    public void handleEmbezzlement(ManagingPartner danSaulheim) {
        // Code that checks if Saulheim had apparent implied authority to act on behalf of the firm
        if (thirdPartyBelievesInDanSaulheimsAuthority()) {
            // The partnership could be held liable for the losses
        }
    }
}
```

#### Innocent Misrepresentation in Contracts and Warranties
When a principal knows an agent is not accurately advised of facts but does not correct either the agent’s or the third party's impressions, the principal can still be held responsible. This concept applies to both contracts and warranties.
:p What is "innocent misrepresentation"?
??x
Innocent misrepresentation in contract law refers to a situation where an agent makes a statement that turns out to be false but does so without knowledge of its falsity or intent to deceive. The principal can still be held liable for this misrepresentation if the principal knew the agent was not accurately advised and did not correct any impressions.
??x
```
public class ContractLaw {
    public void handleMisrepresentation(Agent agent, Principal principal) {
        // Code that checks if the principal is responsible for an agent's innocent misstatement
        if (principal.knowsAgentIsNotAccuratelyAdvised() && !principal.correctsImpressions()) {
            // The principal could be held liable for the misrepresentation
        }
    }
}
```
x??
---

#### Vicarious Liability and Respondeat Superior
An agent is responsible for his or her own torts. However, under the doctrine of respondeat superior (let the master respond), a principal can also be vicariously liable for harm caused by an agent in the course or scope of employment.
:p What does "vicarious liability" mean?
??x
Vicarious liability refers to the legal principle where one party (the principal) is held responsible for the actions of another party (the agent) under certain circumstances. Specifically, under the doctrine of respondeat superior, a principal can be held liable for any harm caused by an agent while performing tasks within the scope or course of employment.
??x
```
public class VicariousLiability {
    public void handleAgentTort(Tort t) {
        // Code that checks if the principal is responsible for the agent's negligent act
        if (t.isWithinScopeOfEmployment()) {
            // The principal could be held liable under respondeat superior
        }
    }
}
```
x??

#### Detour During Employer’s Business
Background context explaining when an employee's actions are within or outside the scope of employment. The employer is liable if the detour is not substantial, but they are generally not liable if it significantly departs from their business.

:p What determines whether an employee's actions during a detour are within the scope of employment?
??x
If the detour is not substantial and serves a business-related purpose, the employer may still be held liable. Conversely, if the departure from the employer’s business is significant, it is considered a "frolic" or personal errand, and the employer will not typically be liable.
For example:
- Mandel stops to pick up friends for cocktails and negligently crashes into Chan's vehicle; this is outside the scope of employment because his actions significantly deviate from his work duties.

```java
// Pseudocode Example
if (detourPurposeIsBusinessRelated && detourNotSignificant) {
    employerLiable();
} else if (detourIsPersonal || detourSignificantlyDeviates) {
    employerNotLiable();
}
```
x??

---

#### Employee Travel Time
Background context explaining that travel time is generally outside the scope of employment unless it is part of an employee's position, such as for a traveling salesperson.

:p Under what circumstances is travel time considered within the scope of employment?
??x
Travel time is usually considered outside the scope of employment. However, if the employee’s job involves significant travel, like that of a traveling salesperson, then the entire business trip, including return home, falls within the scope of employment unless there is a significant departure from the employer's business.

```java
// Pseudocode Example
if (travelIsPartOfJob) {
    travelTimeWithinScope();
} else if (returnHomeIncluded && noSignificantDepartureFromBusiness) {
    travelTimeWithinScope();
} else {
    travelTimeOutsideScope();
}
```
x??

---

#### Notice of Dangerous Conditions
Background context explaining that employers are responsible for any dangerous conditions discovered by employees related to their work.

:p How is the knowledge of a dangerous condition attributed in an employment relationship?
??x
Employers are charged with the knowledge of any dangerous conditions discovered by employees, even if the employer was not directly informed. This means that the employee's discovery and reporting of a hazardous situation can be imputed to the employer through their employment relationship.

For example:
- Brad notices a lead pipe in Martin’s courtyard but neglects to inform him or fix it. John trips on the pipe and is injured; Martin is held liable for this dangerous condition, even though he was not directly informed by Brad.

```java
// Pseudocode Example
if (employeeDiscoversDangerousCondition && reportsToEmployer) {
    employerKnowledgeImputed();
} else if (failsToReportButEmployeeIsEmployed) {
    employerKnowledgeImputed();
}
```
x??

---

#### Liability for Agent's Intentional Torts
Background context explaining that employers are generally not liable for intentional torts committed by employees, but under the doctrine of respondeat superior, they can be held responsible if the act is within the scope and course of employment. Additionally, employers may be held liable even if the acts would not normally be considered within their duties.

:p Can an employer be held liable for an employee's intentional torts?
??x
An employer can be held liable for an employee’s intentional torts if they are committed within the scope and course of employment. For example:

- A department store owner is liable when a security guard, acting as an employee, commits false imprisonment.
- Similarly, a nightclub owner is liable when a bouncer (employee) assaults and batteries a customer while on duty.

Moreover, employers can be held responsible for an employee's propensity to commit tortious acts if the employer knows or should know about it. For instance:
- Chaz hires Alec as a bouncer knowing of his history with criminal assault and battery; if Alec attacks a customer after hours, Chaz may still be liable.

```java
// Pseudocode Example
if (employeeCommittedTortWithinScope && employerKnowsOrShouldKnow) {
    employerLiable();
} else if (propensityKnown && employeeActsOutsideScope) {
    employerLikelyLiable();
}
```
x??

---

#### Reckless Actions by Employees
Background context explaining that employers can be held liable for permitting employees to engage in reckless actions that could injure others.

:p Can an employer be held responsible for allowing an employee's reckless behavior?
??x
An employer is also liable if they permit their employees to engage in reckless actions that can result in injuries. For example, if a bouncer or security guard acts recklessly after hours and injures someone, the employer could still face liability.

```java
// Pseudocode Example
if (employerPermitsRecklessActions && employeeInjuresSomeone) {
    employerLiable();
}
```
x??

#### Vicarious Liability Under Trust Law

Background context explaining the concept. The Uniform Trust Code, specifically Utah’s version under Section 75–7–1010, establishes that a trust is liable for acts performed by trustees "in the course of administering the trust." This standard mirrors the traditional doctrine of respondeat superior, which holds an employer liable for the actions of their employees.

The key aspect here involves determining whether a trustee's act falls within the scope of their responsibilities. The statute provides clarity on interpreting this through established principles derived from case law and legal doctrines.

:p What does Utah’s version of Section 75–7–1010 state regarding trust liability?
??x
Utah’s version of Section 75–7–1010 states that a trust is liable for the trustee’s acts performed "in the course of administering the trust." This interpretation incorporates the standard of respondeat superior, meaning the trust can be held liable for actions taken by trustees within their duties.
x??

---

#### Determining Scope of Employment

Background context explaining the concept. The text outlines criteria to define when a trustee's act is within the scope of employment, which includes three key factors: 
1. Whether the conduct is general in nature to what the agent (trustee) was employed to perform.
2. Whether the conduct occurred during the regular hours and spatial boundaries of work.
3. Whether the acts were motivated at least partially by serving the principal’s interests.

:p What are the three factors used to determine if a trustee's act falls within their scope of employment?
??x
The three factors are:
1. The nature of the conduct should be general in nature to what the trustee was employed to perform.
2. The conduct must occur during regular work hours and spatial boundaries related to the employment.
3. The acts should at least partly serve the principal’s interests.

These criteria help establish whether a trustee's actions can be attributed to their role within the trust administration.
x??

---

#### Modern Interpretations of Agency Relationships

Background context explaining the concept. The text highlights that modern legal interpretations have evolved, moving away from rigid spatial and temporal boundaries in defining agency relationships. Courts now recognize interactions on behalf of an employer even when the employee is not on premises or continuously engaged in assigned work.

:p How have modern courts changed their approach to defining agency relationships?
??x
Modern courts have expanded their definitions of agency relationships by:
- No longer relying heavily on spatial and temporal boundaries.
- Recognizing that employees can represent employers with third parties outside traditional physical and continuous working conditions.
- Adopting standards such as whether the tort is a generally foreseeable consequence of the employer’s enterprise or an outgrowth of it.

This shift aims to make more equitable determinations about liability without overly restrictive criteria.
x??

---

#### Foreseeability in Agency Relationships

Background context explaining the concept. The text mentions that some jurisdictions have adopted a standard based on the foreseeability of consequences related to the employer's business, rather than focusing solely on motives or intentions.

:p How do some courts determine if an employee’s actions fall within their scope of employment?
??x
Some courts use a standard based on the foreseeable nature of the tort in relation to the employer’s enterprise. Specifically, they consider whether:
- The tort is a generally foreseeable consequence of the employer's activities.
- The tort was engendered by the employment or an outgrowth of it.

This approach avoids strict reliance on motives and intentions and focuses more broadly on the nature and consequences of the employee's actions in relation to their employment.
