#### Data Lineage Tracking
Data lineage tracking helps trace the origin and transformation history of data throughout its lifecycle, ensuring transparency and accountability.

:p How do you track data lineage during processing?
??x

To track data lineage, implement metadata management tools that capture where data comes from (source systems), how it changes as it moves through different stages (ETL processes), and where it ends up (target systems). This involves creating a detailed audit trail of data transformations.
```java
// Example pseudocode for logging data transformation steps
public class DataTransformer {
    private List<String> logs;

    public void transformData(String source, String destination) {
        logs.add("Transformed from: " + source);
        // Perform ETL operations here...
        logs.add("Transformed to: " + destination);
    }

    public List<String> getLogs() {
        return logs;
    }
}
```

??x

Data quality checking is critical because poor-quality data can lead to incorrect insights, flawed business decisions, and wasted resources. It involves validating data against predefined standards and cleaning it as necessary.
```java
// Example pseudocode for basic data validation
public class DataValidator {
    public boolean isValid(String value) {
        if (value == null || value.isEmpty()) return false;
        // Add more validation rules here...
        return true;
    }
}
```

Managing sensitive information requires implementing strict access controls, encryption techniques, and regular audits. Identify sensitive data types (e.g., PII, financial data) and apply appropriate security measures to protect them.
```java
// Example pseudocode for classifying data based on sensitivity
public enum DataSensitivity {
    PUBLIC,
    CONFIDENTIAL,
    RESTRICTED
}

public class DataClassifier {
    public static DataSensitivity getClassification(String data) {
        if (data.contains("PII")) return DataSensitivity.RESTRICTED;
        // Add more conditions here...
        return DataSensitivity.PUBLIC;
    }
}
```
x??

#### Data Storage
Data storage involves storing both data and metadata on appropriate systems with adequate protection measures.

:p What are the key aspects of data storage?
??x

Key aspects include choosing the right storage system (data warehouse, data mart, or data lake), encrypting data at rest to protect it from intrusions, backing up data for redundancy, and ensuring proper access controls. This phase is crucial in maintaining the integrity and availability of stored data.
```java
// Example pseudocode for storing and protecting data
public class DataStorage {
    public void storeData(String data, String dataType) {
        if (dataType.equals("sensitive")) {
            // Encrypt data before storage
            encryptData(data);
        }
        // Store data in the appropriate system
        saveToStorageSystem(data);
    }

    private void encryptData(String data) {
        // Encryption logic here...
    }

    private void saveToStorageSystem(String data) {
        // Storage system interaction code here...
    }
}
```

#### Data Usage
The data usage phase involves analyzing and visualizing data to support business operations and decision-making.

:p How does data become useful in the usage phase?
??x

Data becomes useful when it is analyzed, visualized, or queried via user interfaces or BI tools. This phase ensures that data can be used to derive meaningful insights and support informed business decisions.
```java
// Example pseudocode for querying and visualizing data
public class DataAnalyzer {
    public void analyzeAndVisualize(String query) {
        // Execute the query on the storage system
        ResultSet resultSet = executeQuery(query);
        // Process results and generate a visualization
        generateVisualization(resultSet);
    }

    private ResultSet executeQuery(String query) {
        // Code to interact with the data storage system
    }

    private void generateVisualization(ResultSet resultSet) {
        // Code to create visual representations of the data
    }
}
```
